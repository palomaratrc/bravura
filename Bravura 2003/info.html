<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December of 2002, a letter to the editor appeared 
  in our local paper, the <i>North County Times</i>, which made the following claim: 
  &quot;Most of us realize that writing poetry is the refuge of the unstable and 
  the preoccupation of many unteachable American students.&quot; Over the course 
  of the next several weeks, letter after letter appeared to contradict the original 
  author's sentiment. Some of these letters, it should be noted, bore names that 
  appear in the pages that follow. So swift and sudden were the &quot;pro-poetry&quot; 
  responses that the <i>North County Times</i> addressed the 
  situation in an editorial that read, in part, &quot;With Tax Day approaching, 
  war brewing in the Persian Gulf, nuclear sabers rattling in North Korea and 
  California facing a $34.8 billion debt, readers of this newspaper are up in 
  arms about&#8230;poetry.&quot; The editor went on to point out that such an 
  outpouring is &quot;a sign of cultural health.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As faculty co-advisors for <em>Bravura</em> for the 
  fourth year in a row, we couldn't agree more that poetry&#8212;and the creative 
  voice in general&#8212;is worth defending. It is worth defending because it 
  is through this voice that we all come to explore, express, and understand what 
  makes us human. With this belief in mind, we value this annual literary journal 
  precisely because it provides a forum for our students at Palomar to creatively 
  voice their observations, concerns, values, and dreams.&nbsp; <em>Bravura</em> has 
  existed since the 1960s, and it has been steadily evolving over the last few 
  years&#8212;an evolution evidenced not only by the increasing number and variety 
  of submissions we receive, but also by the burgeoning enrollment in English 
  137, the class that is responsible for putting the journal together each spring. 
  Moreover, we have seen greater numbers of students finding their way into the 
  English Department's creative writing classes. Students come to these classes 
  with stories to tell and poems to express, and while there, they learn how to 
  add shape and power to their visions. This process is aided mightily by the 
  considered and sensitive study of creative works&#8212;a study that takes place 
  primarily, but by no means exclusively, in our literature classes. All of these 
  venues and the people involved with them work together to help ensure the &quot;cultural 
  health&quot; of Palomar in particular and our community in general.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But despite the outpouring of letters in the 
  <i>North County Times</i>, the literary and artistic corners of our culture are constantly 
  under attack, usually in the form of budget constraints. As elementary and high 
  school districts tighten their belts, art and music programs are traditionally 
  the first pounds shed&#8212;assuming that they haven't been lost in some earlier 
  round of cuts. Likewise, colleges may be tempted to look at theater, music, 
  art, and literature programs as expendable; after all, do these programs really 
  account for themselves in an economic world?</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, they don't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet they are indispensable. To sacrifice these 
  programs that give expression to the human spirit and celebrate the imagination 
  is to grievously wrong our students. If our schools do not champion the arts 
  despite budget shortfalls, our students will be given a tragic lesson in values 
  and priorities; in short, our students will not venture forth into the world 
  of the arts but step ponderously into the room of economic viability. And then, 
  to quote Calvin Gross, &quot;the dollars [they] gain in the absence of enlightenment 
  like this will be earned in drudgery and spent in ignorance.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volume you hold in your hands contains the 
  voices and visions of Palomar students who have taken the risk to explore the 
  world around them. On their behalf, we would like to welcome you along on that 
  journey. </p>
