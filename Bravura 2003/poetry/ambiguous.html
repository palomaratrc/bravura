<p align="center"><em>Ambiguous And Ludicrous</em></p>
<p align="left">She sat on the edge of our bed<br>
  silently weeping into her hands<br>
  Sunlight crept into the room <br>
  through cracked blinds on the window<br>
  Her aged blond hair was almost white<br>
  but it looked like the day we meet, in this light<br>
  Her wrinkled hands were still, milky smooth<br>
  Like a dried rose, they maintained their beauty<br>
  softly trembling under the pressure of her tears<br>
  She cried for the ills of humanity<br>
  She cried for the loss of innocence<br>
  She cried because I was a spiteful old man<br>
  and I just sat there, rigid, arms at my sides<br>
  staring blankly at her blond-white hair<br>
  and her trembling hands<br>
  Sitting in my torn shorts<br>
  wondering why I hadn&#8217;t been fed<br>
  She deserved better</p>
