  <p align="center"><em>A Room I Love</em></p>
  <p align="left">I&#8217;m warm in blankets.<br>
    The blinds are drawn<br>
    Smells of her are filling my head<br>
    Except this spot on this pillow<br>
    Where I always lay my head,<br>
    that smells like&#8230;<br>
    Me,<br>
    She brings her diet Pepsi with her<br>
    And looks at me.<br>
    How long have I been asleep in her room?</p>
  <p align="left">I hold her tight in my arms and <br>
    look at the posters on the wall<br>
    all around the room.<br>
    Sun squeezes in<br>
    through slats in the blinds<br>
    and the dusty haze carries columns of light<br>
    towards our feet.<br>
    I don&#8217;t have to turn my head to tell she&#8217;s asleep<br>
    I tell her I love her<br>
    though she can&#8217;t hear me.</p>
