<p>Your memories come upon me violently<br>
  within these redwood plank board walls<br>
  lying on that queen sized futon on the floor<br>
  next to you <br>
  fire gypsy-goddess girl<br>
  the warmth from the tiny space heater <br>
  next to you<br>
  house crowded with laughter<br>
  from all the summer bonfire <br>
  incense smoke filled parties<br>
  reduced to the twin flames of you and me<br>
  I&#8217;ll climb the ladder to the loft bed <br>
  with the shaggy lambs-wool blankets<br>
  now empty of you<br>
  but still filled with your scent<br>
  I&#8217;ll lie there and remember the night <br>
  with you in my arms <br>
  watching your perfect dream-breaths <br>
  enter and escape <br>
  out the window of the house<br>
  you showed me how to climb through<br>
  the cat&#8217;s door, <br>
  you told me<br>
  after climbing through <br>
  to plug in the lights <br>
  we had strung up around the house<br>
  where I found me again<br>
  me, finally <br>
  rediscovering myself again <br>
  every time you said my name<br>
  in that house<br>
  shelves piled high with books, CDs, videos, <br>
  windowsills framed by candles and crystals<br>
  just enough to catch the sun <br>
  casting rainbows on the walls<br>
  shining on your redred hair<br>
  sparkling in your jade eyes<br>
  in that house<br>
  smells of rosemary, sage, lavender, <br>
  and a million other healing things<br>
  but mostly you<br>
  sitting on the kitchen counter<br>
  as I whispered to you my secret fears<br>
  the sickness, the doubt, <br>
  sharing with me your own secret rage<br>
  invisible scars<br>
  we washed them clean <br>
  in that house<br>
  where we kissed for the first time<br>
  devouring stolen hours of each other<br>
  I could stay with you forever <br>
  in that house<br>
