<p align="center"> <em>Bareback</em><br>
</p>
<p>You are the wild<br>
  The savage and untamed one<br>
  Whose thick skin rumbles<br>
  Like dry desert clay<br>
  Thundering against my thighs<br>
  Weighing your heavy bones is<br>
  Your thick hide which<br>
  I swear I clench with<br>
  Every desire in my body<br>
  I pull my reddened fingers<br>
  Through the knots in your<br>
  Wind curled hair<br>
  Yet I know <br>
  That with each<br>
  Torn and leather like breath<br>
  You are ready.<br>
  Your ambition, the ambiguity<br>
  The instinct<br>
  Never tangible to me<br>
  Is beyond this graveled sand<br>
  And you are ready.<br>
  You feel the electric power <br>
  Sever the earth<br>
  And you can run<br>
  Far from this caged drought<br>
  The sun blazes your eyes<br>
  And you know<br>
  You can flee<br>
  Escape<br>
  You are ready.<br>
