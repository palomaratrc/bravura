<p>his hair.<br>
  My blood.<br>
  I ache inside this echo of a lullaby<br>
  with blind ears and a mouth full of lemons<br>
  and salt.<br>
  eyes cut and cannot wince,<br>
  My heart is too much for him.<br>
  I will leave once more.<br>
  and he will drink all over again.<br>
  no hope inside tonight<br>
  goodnight<br>
  Love.<br>
  I knew it would end like this.<br>
  in a black gown and hair full of white<br>
  tears, my ears ringing out of tune in<br>
  This dark piano.<br>
  cold night, warm hand, under the slip, between <br>
  the thighs.<br>
  tonight, I need a break from my virginity.</p>
