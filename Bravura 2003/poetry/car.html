<p align="center"> <em>Car</em></p>
<p align="left">You:<br>
  inscrutable, irresistible, irrational, perfect.<br>
  Me:<br>
  paranoid, presumptuous, parasitic, insecure.<br>
  Your fingers play air guitar as you drive down the street.<br>
  It's dark, and I think you just ran a red light two blocks back.<br>
  However, I am not sure, because the blur was in my peripheral,<br>
  and I was too busy singing along.<br>
  My fingers rest on the edge of the seat, inches from the gear shift.<br>
  I always wait for you to shift gears before I say anything.<br>
  It seems safer that way: within the speed limit.<br>
  Sometimes I wonder what would happen if I just pulled back and forgot about 
  you.<br>
  I don't want to.<br>
  It's not about what I want it to be about;<br>
  I hate it and I can't make you rhyme.<br>
  This is one of those silent rides<br>
  where time peels like old paint and smells worse.<br>
  You speed out of the turn;<br>
  I feel like we're rolling downhill.<br>
  I remember...<br>
  Last night we hung out in a parking lot, late and empty.<br>
  It was the best six hours of my year,<br>
  so far.<br>
  I fell asleep standing up, leaning against you<br>
  as we slow-danced to the stars and the traffic crashing like waves,<br>
  or my heart.<br>
  Because I don't know you.<br>
  It was too fast,<br>
  so I leaned over, whispered against your ear;<br>
  you stomped the brake pedal to the floor.<br>
  I think I got whiplash as you<br>
  pulled over and unlocked the doors.<br>
  But I got out and walked away on my own.</p>
