  <p align="center"><em>A Conflict of Poetry</em></p>
  <p align="left">He sits with a myriad of weaponry, <br>
    Rhyme scheme, rhythm and meter.<br>
    His foe only himself, but his target<br>
    A the kingdom of false promises,<br>
    Placid white it lies there awaiting siege.<br>
    The poet moves his pieces into place.<br>
    The pencils and pens hold their positions.<br>
    Patience is needed for the right moment;<br>
    Too soon and the attack will prove vain,<br>
    Too late and the battle will be lost.</p>
  <p align="left">It&#8217;s time.</p>
  <p align="left">He moves in striking at the nemesis.<br>
    The defenses are strong and holding well,<br>
    The poet must remain the Captain of his words.<br>
    His ideas flourish and form into vivid imagery,<br>
    Catapulting his confidence to charge on.<br>
    There is no time for the adversary to retaliate.<br>
    Words fill the kingdom,<br>
    The once pure land has nothing left but retreat,<br>
    It takes its remaining forces to the borderlands.<br>
    The enemy has been defeated.<br>
    Though a battle has been won, the land is devastated.<br>
    Grammar all alone shouting for punctuation,<br>
    And casualties of words missing letters.<br>
    But the ideas are done fighting and it is time to rest.<br>
    The poet has proven himself worthy in battle,<br>
    for now.</p>

  </p>
  <p align="left">Do not listen to your father, he lies.<br>
    A child torn between two lovers fate.<br>
    Do not listen to your mother, she lies.</p>
  <p align="left">Child in the night hears his mother&#8217;s cries.<br>
    He tires to scream, but the screams come too late.<br>
    Do not listen to your father, he lies.</p>
  <p align="left">The father knows no more love, though he tries,<br>
    His attempted words will come out with hate.<br>
    Do not listen to your mother, she lies.</p>
  <p align="left">The end is near but the mother denies.<br>
    For the child, the mother will translate,<br>
    Do not listen to your father, he lies.</p>
  <p align="left">The parents absent, as childhood dies.<br>
    Long lasting words are his parent&#8217;s debate.<br>
    Do not listen to your mother, she lies.</p>
  <p align="left">When he is older he may become wise,<br>
    But forever will hear the words of eight,<br>
    Do not listen to your father, he lies.<br>
    Do not listen to your mother, she lies.</p>

  <p align="center"><em>Lefty</em><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">unfit baseball mitt,<br>
    special scissors,<br>
    smudged homework,<br>
    wanting Left,<br>
    never being Right.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Line of Temptation</em><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Waist Watchers frozen food,<br>
    Fat free milk and tofu,<br>
    Celery sticks and carrot bits, <br>
    All items in her plastic basket.<br>
    To the checkout line.<br>
    Ten items or less,<br>
    Should be express,<br>
    But the delay is great indeed.</p>
  <p align="left">Strategically placed are daily temptations:<br>
    Butterfingers and a Milky Way,<br>
    Bazooka Joe and Big League Chew,<br>
    And King Sized Snickers.<br>
    With her stomach rumbling,<br>
    And taste buds quivering,<br>
    One hand reaches for the evil,<br>
    A momentary hero speaks,<br>
    &#8220;Will this be all?&#8221; <br>
    A nod is all she can muster.<br>
    Temptation, <br>
    Neither in paper nor plastic,<br>
    Is still shelved and now beyond reach.</p>
  <p align="left">She heads toward the car,<br>
    Horror strikes.</p>
  <p align="left">&#8220;Shit!&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">She forgot laundry detergent.<br>
    The devilry will get a second chance.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Long Endings</em></p>
  <p align="left">War. <br>
    It speaks not true.<br>
    Such a short word.<br>
    War is forever.<br>
    No after or before.</p>
  <p align="left">War.<br>
    It speaks not true.<br>
    Telling nothing of the memories.<br>
    Foretelling nothing of empty glory.<br>
    We are all children of war.</p>
  <p align="left">Peace.<br>
    It speaks not true.<br>
    Such an easy word to say.<br>
    Promising a rise that will never come.<br>
    A child&#8217;s dream conjured for hope.</p>
  <p align="left">Peace.<br>
    It speaks not true.<br>
    Does it lie between wars?<br>
    Have all the heroes gone when you return?<br>
    Hope not for peace in times of war.</p>
  <p align="left">Hope<br>
    It is the glory that moves us.<br>
    It is the hope for an end.<br>
    Peace will come.<br>
    When there are none left for war.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Shoe</em></p>
  <p align="left">My value was never really appreciated.<br>
    To the vain I was merely a statement of fashion.<br>
    The working class demanded more comfort,<br>
    And I when I failed, <br>
    Because I had to eventually fail,<br>
    I was tossed to the side; <br>
    Ignored like a vagabond.<br>
    The miles we shared are forgotten,<br>
    And you began a new search,<br>
    Looking for another to use, <br>
    And shoe your needs.<br>
    You will tread past me,<br>
    Everyday,<br>
    With this hussy,<br>
    Laces and leather<br>
    Were always what you wanted.<br>
    My tattered suede<br>
    And outdated lines are forgotten.<br>
    You break my soul,<br>
    And all I ever wanted was to support you.<br>
    Now my end, <br>
    65 &frac12; pounds of hair you named &#8220;Chompers&#8221;. <br>
    From this point,<br>
    I have two things to look forward to,<br>
    A torment of saliva,<br>
    And an eternity in an unmarked grave.</p>
