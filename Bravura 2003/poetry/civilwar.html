<div align="center"><em>A Civil War Poem</em><br>
</div>
<p> The shriek of dead silence or a slight ruckus,<br>
  Birds fluttering or leaves shaking to the ground<br>
  After the guns crackle and twinkle with red white and blue.<br>
  Amidst the smoke, the star spangled banner of canons,<br>
  Roaring in silent fields of fear faced men behind the mantle of honor<br>
  And generals high on horses,<br>
  Commanding young men to point and pledge an undying loyalty<br>
  to the divided soil.</p>
<p><br>
  Defining gray powder sounds-BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!<br>
  The rhythm of vertigo, deaths demon perched awfully in the ear.<br>
  The Revolution a muffled echo in exhausted feet,<br>
  Skin split hands grip the extension of I pledge allegiance,<br>
  one nation under god, indivisible with liberty and justice for <br>
  all.</p>
<p><br>
  Knuckles white, like the ghosts of or memories,<br>
  Ache in the task of carefully distributing bread rash-ins. <br>
  The clanking of my rifle and its crude wood and steel,<br>
  Still hot with death,<br>
  Reminds me of sacrifice, what I have lost,<br>
  What I have forfeited in the act.<br>
  That I have traded a wife and child for this distinguished approbation.</p>
<p><br>
  Most men cry alone here. </p>
<p>Proudly we march and civilly we line up,<br>
  turn and face the bright sun. </p>
