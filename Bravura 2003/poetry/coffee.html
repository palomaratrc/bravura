  <p align="center"><em>Coffee Shop Shared</em></p>
  <p align="left">A coffee and sandwich with barely a word.<br>
    Yet together we intertwine in mere glances<br>
    Never to be severed by the sharpest of swords.<br>
    It is not I that sits in silence, but we that<br>
    swim in the sea of placidness.<br>
    This is the relationship as we bathe in our aura<br>
    Suddenly succumbing to sentious cyclical scenes<br>
    Sharing scamingly sexual sects and means.<br>
    Enveloping the earth our future ceases<br>
    Paranoid particulars and pieces begin to part.<br>
    The view, I stare into brown pupils of art.<br>
    My love has endured time, life&#8217;s rhythmic beats of the heart<br>
    No longer exists as we surpassed the start.<br>
    Space and time invoked between our souls,<br>
    We teach and learn abroad physical imprints printed like burns.<br>
    She sits relaxed, simple cup in hand unchanged,<br>
    Sealed inside our globe.<br>
    All else seems unknown, while in sequence hardships linger.<br>
    A pointed finger directed to nothing directed to nothing.<br>
    Silent singing robust.<br>
    Stares entranced words ringing.<br>
    The sound of love in the coffee shop shared.</p>
