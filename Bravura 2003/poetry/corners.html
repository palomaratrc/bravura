  </em></p>
<p align="left">I<br>
  There are times when the corners seem like the best place to be,<br>
  When the dark is covering me from head to feet. <br>
  Crouching in the rain of the moonlit trees, <br>
  hiding from the eyes that are searching for me. <br>
  Watching for a time, <br>
  the falling of the leaves,<br>
  and the desecration of my shallow body,<br>
  and my lonely tree. <br>
  Shivering in the rain of the fallen leaves,<br>
  from my stretching tree,<br>
  waiting for the time to creep through the light,<br>
  and go unnoticed into the corner that begs for me. <br>
  II<br>
  Winding though the darkness, <br>
  Now consumed in all its glory.<br>
  The tree that once was,<br>
  Basks bare now in dark light.<br>
  Empty of life.<br>
  Crunching its old leaves,<br>
  I walk through the lonely darkness,<br>
  Not fearing the watching eyes.<br>
  My corner left behind.<br>
  I walk in the spaces where the light used to be,<br>
  Begging for its return I fall and stumble,<br>
  To the worst place of all.<br>
  My dense dark corner,<br>
  with its view of my lifeless tree.</p>
