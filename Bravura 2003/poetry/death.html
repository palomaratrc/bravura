  <p align="center"><em>The Death of This Life</em></p>
  <p align="left">Drowning in a pool of sorrow, my skin torn off, revealing my 
    inside. <br>
    Your piercing look shooting through me.<br>
    No time to think or breath.<br>
    My heart beats faster now, louder, harder, can&#8217;t contain it. <br>
    The only sound I hear is your voice tormenting me.<br>
    Please wake me up, open my eyes to this nightmare. <br>
    When will it be over?<br>
    My body falling; wailing with pain and suffering. <br>
    This endless grief and hatred claws at my soul, wishing to devour me. <br>
    Hold onto something, don&#8217;t let it overpower me.<br>
    Will this ever pass? <br>
    My eyes shut, long to open to see the light. <br>
    My body being hurled into an eternity of anguish. <br>
    This torment rips the life out of me. <br>
    Will I ever be whole again?</p>
