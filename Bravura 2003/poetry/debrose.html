  <p align="center"><em>Cloud Dancer</em></p>
  <p align="left">He danced the dance of rain, for the drought had brought much 
    pain.<br>
    His moccasins circled the dust like drops of rainfall busting from the sky,<br>
    And soon he would let out a heartfelt cry.<br>
    He was Cloud Dancer, a spirit known well. He would dance his dance under the 
    moon until he softly fell.<br>
    Suddenly:<br>
    A cry in the shadows, a raindrop upon a painted face. A gust of wind&#8230;<br>
    The spirit had danced.</p>

    <em>Ceyena Grey Wolf</em></p>
  <p align="left">In the winter the grey wolf runs wild, as free as a bird as 
    swift as a child.<br>
    He is truly alone without friend or foe, always moving and on the go.</p>
  <p align="left">His pack is behind him, ready and eager, patiently awaiting 
    his next move. <br>
    It is diligence and power he has to prove.<br>
    He is always ready for the kill, using his cunning and mighty skill.</p>
  <p align="left">No-one defies him for he is the alpha leader. And all who understand 
    him do not test his power. For they know whom to trust and obey&#8230; many 
    who fear him look away.</p>
  <p align="left">Grey wolf, alone and wild, as determined as a child. He stands 
    alone without fear,<br>
    Always knowing that his prey is near. His pack is soon by his side, ready 
    to listen and abide. His endurance is endless and he has proudly earned his 
    role.</p>
  <p align="left">If you listen closely, you can hear his call and let it touch 
    far into your soul.<br>
    For this grey wolf is truly a spirit of loyalty, determination, fearlessness, 
    and honor.</p>

  <p align="left"> An infamous feeder, <br>
    And always,</p>

  <p><em>Lakota Woman</em></p>
  <p align="left">She was a Lakota woman proud and strong<br>
    And she knew that she would always have a place to belong.<br>
    Her heritage was her own and her blood was pure;<br>
    For the Lakota woman had much to endure.<br>
    Her path was not always easy and her road not always smooth.<br>
    But her strength and courage always took hold.<br>
    Even during the white mans endless pursuit of yellow gold.</p>
  <p align="left">She bore children and made warriors out of boys,<br>
    Where bows, arrows and knives were their only toys.</p>
  <p align="left">The Lakota woman proud and true, honor, pride and war<br>
    Is all she knew.</p>

    Two Wild Horses</em></p>
  <p align="left">Two wild horses running free<br>
    In the meadow, along the tree<br>
    Running through the air, <br>
    With no worry or care, <br>
    Just running wild with his mare.</p>
  <p align="left">His hair flying softly through the wind,<br>
    With his only beloved friend.</p>
  <p align="left">Without a worry on his mind<br>
    Just looking for someone gentle and kind.</p>

    <em>The Mighty Chief</em></p>
  <p align="left">It was a mighty chief they knew<br>
    For they knew no other,<br>
    For many considered him their blood brother.<br>
    He was old and wise, he told stories of long ago.<br>
    Of a place called Little Big Horn and storied of great buffalo.<br>
    He told of a time when many bellies were full.<br>
    He who acquired great honor was &#8220;Sitting Bull&#8221;.</p>
  <p align="left">His legend was strong, his strength he gained from the eagles 
    and wolves.<br>
    Many hunters brought him great medicine and buffalo hooves.<br>
    He fought hard for his people, teaching them to be strong and brave,<br>
    Never allowing their spirits to rest in the grave.<br>
    He is honored by their belief, for he is and always will be..,</p>
  <p><br>
    <em>The Thunder</em></p>
  <p align="left">His eyes stared at me in wonder<br>
    With each glance my heart began to thunder,</p>
  <p align="left">What was it in his stare that looked like such a glare?<br>
    Oh how my heart began to thunder&#8230;.<br>
    A chill ran down my spine&#8230;. and somehow I knew<br>
    it was a sign.<br>
    A sign of war, a sign of things that were to come&#8230;</p>
  <p align="left">The great Eagle knew!</p>
