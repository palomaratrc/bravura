  <p align="center"><em>Looking</em><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Discovering truth takes effort<br>
    Of all the being that you are</p>
  <p align="left">Holding fast to all that comes<br>
    Making inward changes as you go</p>
  <p align="left">Bring forth your understanding<br>
    And allowing it to be added to</p>
  <p align="left">Letting context with rules astray<br>
    Causing mind conclusion mayhem</p>
  <p align="left">Vulnerable you become because<br>
    The truth has a way of telling</p>
  <p align="left">It was a choice you spoke outward<br>
    To gain girth and move forward</p>
  <p align="left">Stopping now would leave you hung<br>
    To numerous questions unanswered</p>
  <p align="left">So come on keep going now<br>
    And I will offer a hand to you</p>
  <p align="left">For no where did I say<br>
    You would be alone</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><em>My Own</em><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">The master of my own demise I am<br>
    On whether I want the dark or the light<br>
    And make positive I want the love or the hate<br>
    Can make a decision that is me all right<br>
    I am the master of my own demise</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Ode to Those</em><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Weird ones, freakish ones, off ones too<br>
    And all black wearing cucks in august<br>
    Just every person who get<br>
    That passerby funny eye<br>
    You do the dreams<br>
    And fantasies<br>
    While showing<br>
    Your penis ring,<br>
    Breast and derriere<br>
    Making the others say<br>
    Someday<br>
    Lime-green spikes I&#8217;ll have in my hair<br>
    I&#8217;m gonna put a tat&#8217; right there<br>
    You Hell&#8217;s Angels<br>
    With the fashionably uninclined<br>
    Drag Kings and Queens<br>
    Mostly those who do<br>
    What they must do<br>
    To be outstanding<br>
    Not showy<br>
    But true<br>
    I encourage<br>
    Keep expressing<br>
    Your inner worldviews<br>
    Make them hate<br>
    So, Thank you<br>
    From the bottom of our hearts<br>
    &#8216;Cause really we all wish<br>
    We all hope<br>
    That there will be an eon<br>
    When originality<br>
    Is cool</p>

  <p align="center"><em>Puzzle Pieces</em><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Purpose, reason,<br>
    Fate, why,<br>
    Destiny too<br>
    As a being<br>
    I and you<br>
    Ask this all<br>
    Our moments<br>
    In our lives</p>
  <p align="left">Dreams don&#8217;t provide<br>
    Everything<br>
    Neither does reality</p>
  <p align="left">So where is it<br>
    The answer to our<br>
    Biggest question<br>
    That us all<br>
    Ask our creator</p>
  <p align="left">If we are here<br>
    For pure worship<br>
    of Majesty<br>
    Then there is<br>
    Something<br>
    Wrong with our days<br>
    In which we<br>
    Only come<br>
    Out in our nights</p>
  <p align="left">Can we be here<br>
    As an experiment<br>
    In which the survivor<br>
    Gets to go<br>
    To the next level<br>
    And the loser<br>
    Just loses and<br>
    Has to remain<br>
    In the same place</p>
  <p align="left"></p>
  <p align="left"></p>
  <p align="left">Does a person<br>
    Have to win favor<br>
    Because everyone<br>
    Truly wants to<br>
    Win Majesty&#8217;s favor<br>
    In order to gain<br>
    Paradise</p>
  <p align="left">There has to be more<br>
    Than just coincidence<br>
    That all are living and<br>
    Dying here too</p>
  <p align="left">For there are clues<br>
    To why<br>
    Beings are being</p>
  <p align="left">A puzzle piece<br>
    Has to be found<br>
    And when one<br>
    Is discovered<br>
    Please<br>
    Don&#8217;t do like the others<br>
    Let the rest of us know</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Quiet Is&#8230;?</em><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">You ever wonder<br>
    Where the quiet is<br>
    Listen<br>
    After the random noises<br>
    Have been shut up<br>
    Stores are closed<br>
    The lights off<br>
    And everyone&#8217;s asleep<br>
    The oceans and lakes rest<br>
    Unblows the wind<br>
    And wild things cease<br>
    No leaves fall<br>
    Along with rain<br>
    Your eyes closed<br>
    Lungs subdued<br>
    Heart muffled<br>
    Mind calm<br>
    Eardrums whine no more<br>
    Peace, tranquility<br>
    Silence has come<br>
    Then hear<br>
    Now, you&#8217;re afraid<br>
    Silence has come</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Simply Put</em><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Simply put off the logic of God<br>
    The world who cares to not want God<br>
    Who sees God as not truth</p>
  <p align="left">And see we on a spiritual side of the heart</p>
  <p align="left">We wonder why a fly flew by<br>
    and by the by<br>
    Does it matter</p>
  <p align="left">What does the universe have for we to see<br>
    Does the universe really exist for we<br>
    Why the concern</p>
  <p align="left">There comes a time to let go<br>
    We tend to absorb safety<br>
    Well unseen is the net</p>
  <p align="left">Pull we out of the middle<br>
    And hold true<br>
    We can never be free as but one</p>
  <p align="left">The Ancients knew well what we the Future wanted to see<br>
    A straightforwardly complicated book<br>
    New to the mind old to the spirit</p>
  <p align="left">We question the present<br>
    We take a word without sight<br>
    A thought without place</p>
  <p align="left">We want wisdom without experience<br>
    Knowledge from instant gratitude<br>
    We confuse simple understanding</p>
  <p align="left">Because we known where is the Soul<br>
    Who created we to be moved<br>
    The Complete to all that is complete</p>
  <p align="left">Simply put off the logic of God<br>
    The world who cares to not want God<br>
    Who sees God as not truth</p>

  <p align="left">What flavor is<br>
    Your bread<br>
    Is it sweet-bitter<br>
    Or bitter-sweet</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

  <p align="left">Experience<br>
    A reason<br>
    That line to not ever cross</p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    What is not right<br>
    Where the limit is<br>
    On what can be done</p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    Just be certain<br>
    And absolutely sure<br>
    The fun</p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    Will remain<br>
    When the years<br>
    Come</p>

  <p align="center"><em>Who&#8217;s Me</em><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">Would I be bored if I never watched a movie or seen a television 
    commercial</p>
  <p align="left">What about if others never told me of some adventure in a book</p>
  <p align="left">I wonder if I wouldn&#8217;t mind if I had a big derriere when 
    I saw a small one in a magazine</p>
  <p align="left">Could I get along with the opposite gender if I wasn&#8217;t 
    told of the issues between</p>
  <p align="left">Would I want power, with money if no one else had any</p>
  <p align="left">Where at what point would I age</p>
  <p align="left">Would sex be clean</p>
  <p align="left">Would I be killed if there were no rules against being killed</p>
  <p align="left">Then, would there be love because skin color is no concern</p>
  <p align="left">There is also reading I say I&#8217;m fast enough and my intelligence 
    pecking</p>
  <p align="left">And is there really a reason to know everything</p>
  <p align="left">So what is it that made you who you are was it all mentioned 
    above and more</p>
  <p align="left">Or would you be troubled if I didn&#8217;t mention anything</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Your Intent</em><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">As a believer of God<br>
    I am quite perplexed<br>
    All the &#8220;books&#8221; that has &#8220;come&#8221; from God<br>
    Things are just not right with me as I read these &#8220;books&#8221;<br>
    I am very hated<br>
    I can do no right by God<br>
    As a woman<br>
    Many of God&#8217;s &#8220;books&#8221; say I am to summit<br>
    To a man that is my husband or not<br>
    No matter the situation at hand<br>
    In other versions of God&#8217;s &#8220;books&#8221;<br>
    Yes, I am equal<br>
    But still<br>
    I am not a man<br>
    And in other terms<br>
    Though it is &#8220;written&#8221;<br>
    That woman was created second from man<br>
    I am in all cases third from an animal<br>
    With whatever religion I choose to summit devotion<br>
    To God I am not a man<br>
    Then turn the corner around to the knowings of these &#8220;books&#8221;<br>
    According to God I am just horrible<br>
    God hates that which is about me<br>
    And will not ever smile upon me<br>
    Even when I choose the &#8220;right&#8221; belief<br>
    Simply because first I am a heathenish infidel<br>
    Then I am a woman<br>
    And to add one more truth<br>
    I am unlike you<br>
    So go on continue with your process of thought<br>
    Woman and man alike<br>
    Gathering more to the &#8220;tribe&#8221;<br>
    And just go on pointing the finger<br>
    Continue to tell them all<br>
    That you know God<br>
    And all of God&#8217;s thoughts<br>
    Since look it is written in many &#8220;books&#8221;<br>
    What we want God to be<br>
    For God does have control of it all<br>
    Yes God is all seeing<br>
    Knowing your every intent</p>
