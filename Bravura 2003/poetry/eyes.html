  <p align="center"><em>The Eyes of Shame</em></p>
  <p align="left">Suspended in a moment.<br>
    Seized by her agony.<br>
    Confined in mute desire.<br>
    Yearning for that hopeful meaning found only in nameless souls.<br>
    Frozen in that ancient time of fate.<br>
    Her eyes fade past their shades of plastered smiles.<br>
    Liberated from the cage that burned guilt and pain into time forever.<br>
    Love is young and endless, never seeing that shame and anguish.</p>
