  <p align="center"><em>Flowers</em><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">And the hunter&#8217;s meat bouquet<br>
    would gather itself to say:</p>
  <p>The blood from all our brothers<br>
    now it dries up-now it sours<br>
    No longer set like seas and mountains<br>
    may we stay fertile like the flowers<br>
    <br>
    And the farmer&#8217;s bread bouquet<br>
    would sew itself to say:</p>
  <p>Might fathers see their children<br>
    as beasts of burden see their plowers<br>
    while old maids fat for all their suckling <br>
    someday starve for the gift of flowers</p>
  <p>And the merchant&#8217;s coin bouquet<br>
    would root itself to say:</p>
  <p>May the policies of kings<br>
    know that their greed is ours<br>
    Let the overflow of compost<br>
    be the rising price of flowers</p>
  <p>And the priest&#8217;s iron bouquet<br>
    would bloom itself to say:</p>
  <p>More than the leach is loath to flinch<br>
    the harlot never cowers<br>
    Had she not taken of its fruit<br>
    she would still have worn its flowers</p>
  <p>And the demon&#8217;s flesh bouquet<br>
    would ripen itself to say:</p>
  <p>The lower life is at its end<br>
    Wings spread from fragrant towers<br>
    A vanity sacred as it was<br>
    when invented by the flowers</p>
  <p>And the scribe&#8217;s pen bouquet<br>
    would seed itself to say: <br>
    <br>
    Looking down at pacing sand<br>
    the looking glass of passing hours<br>
    This sundial in the stone is cracked<br>
    for the shadows of growing flowers</p>
