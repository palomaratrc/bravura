<div align="center"><em>For One</em><br>
</div>
<p>To say I am done with this world is a lie<br>
  I am done with all the boozing I use to do<br>
  The drugs the fornication that came with it too<br>
  Done with those that helped me along in that life<br>
  Kissing their hand and else where<br>
  Of people who said were my friend<br>
  Just weren&#8217;t in the end<br>
  Someday they will understand</p>
<p>I am through with the liars<br>
  Back-stabbers just all the hurtful people whom<br>
  Want to hurt people like you<br>
  The greed the cheating the thieves<br>
  In all the twisted ways they come<br>
  I am done with the whole deal I was dealt<br>
  In learning all those ways<br>
  All the gross emotions I always felt</p>
<p>My pattern has changed<br>
  They up there are slowly fading away<br>
  That I may move along <br>
  With a whole different way of living<br>
  No more of the mistrust and misgivings<br>
  But am I looking for a new form of life<br>
  A walk of a brighter light<br>
  Is that what I want for me</p>
<p>Do I want the peace and the tranquil harmony<br>
  Of making my life sweet and happy<br>
  I laugh and laugh more at all the little funnies<br>
  Bring in people who enjoy doing the same too<br>
  Should I bask in the glee<br>
  Is that what I look for to come out of me<br>
  Because I wonder will it be true<br>
  For that is what I use to do in that life now distant</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
  I would have some fun with thoughts rolling<br>
  I had no question of is this right or is this wrong<br>
  I just quite simply went along<br>
  Spur of the moment decisions here planned ones there<br>
  They would all end up still in the no where<br>
  Trying to lose that itchy irritation of incomplete<br>
  Thinking that is why others were there<br>
  To help me find me</p>
<p>Then I began<br>
  It really felt silly<br>
  Talking to a room that was empty<br>
  But I knew I wanted the truth of why<br>
  I was existing<br>
  I came to the air with no blame attached<br>
  Allowing my feelings to come hatched<br>
  Letting my tears and giggles flow plenty</p>
<p>Wondered why I had this level of empty<br>
  Looking back on all that I, yes I did<br>
  I appreciated the sweet bitter that was left<br>
  Understood it was not how I wanted to develop<br>
  But knowing I was not looking for my perfection<br>
  It was I hoping and reaching just for direction<br>
  When I stopped to ask if there is more<br>
  Seen me different behind closed doors</p>
<p>Completeness I want to fine tune<br>
  But all happy is not for me<br>
  I wake for the troubles and discontents<br>
  And submerse when enjoyments come between<br>
  Do I want to die crying<br>
  Do I want to die laughing<br>
  That is not for me to decide<br>
  Because either way I do die</p>
<p>For one,<br>
  I will know rest came from the inside<br>
  Looking out</p>
