<div align="center"><em>How to Survive Being Mexican and White </em><br>
  <p align="left">A long brown braid.<br>
    A German nose.<br>
    A thin upper lip,<br>
    A fat lower one.</p>
  <p align="left"> &#8220;What are you?&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">Don&#8217;t answer that. <br>
    Or else you&#8217;ll have to explain<br>
    Everything.<br>
    Because one word<br>
    Can&#8217;t excuse</p>
  <p align="left">Why you love enchiladas,<br>
    But have never tried menudo.<br>
    Why you can&#8217;t dance cumbias,<br>
    Why you can&#8217;t roll your r&#8217;s.<br>
    Why you don&#8217;t drink tequila.<br>
    You must be a White girl.</p>
  <p align="left">Why your body turns brown in the summer,<br>
    But your hair goes blonde.<br>
    Why your best friend is a cousin.<br>
    Why you don&#8217;t date White boys.<br>
    Why you don&#8217;t laugh at <br>
    Field worker jokes.<br>
    You must be Mexican.</p>
  <p align="left">Go home.<br>
    Say hi to the Virgin on the mantle.<br>
    Kick back.<br>
    Listen to Johnny Mathis for awhile.<br>
    Think about your dead grandma,<br>
    Her apple pies.<br>
    Call your abuelita,<br>
    Ask her how to say<br>
    &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221;<br>
    In Spanish.</p>
  <p align="left">Enroll in a Chicano Studies class,<br>
    Pretend you know who Huitzilopochtli is.<br>
    Pronounce &#8220;maize&#8221; correctly.<br>
    Learn about the mestizo,<br>
    And write a poem about it.</p>
  <p align="left"></p>
  <p align="left">Stop blaming<br>
    Mom for her whiteness<br>
    And Dad for his brownness.</p>
  <p align="left">Stop avoiding <br>
    Your boyfriend&#8217;s family,<br>
    Even though you can&#8217;t talk to them.</p>
  <p align="left">Don&#8217;t change you name<br>
    From Michelle to Marisol.</p>
  <p align="left">Ask your Tia for stories<br>
    About Mexico,<br>
    And your Uncle<br>
    About Black Lung Disease.</p>
  <p align="left">Inhale it all,<br>
    The menudo and the tripas,<br>
    The cornbread and the sauerkraut<br>
    Listen to the accent<br>
    Without translating in your head.<br>
    Dance stupidly.<br>
    Speak illiterately.<br>
    Nobody is watching.</p>
  <p align="left">Remember how to say,<br>
    &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">&#8220;No s&eacute;.&#8221; <br>
  </p>
