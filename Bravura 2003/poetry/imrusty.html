<div align="center"><em>I&#8217;m Rusty</em><br>
  <p align="left">I live out here alone<br>
    Under a blanket,<br>
    by the trashcans.<br>
    I know I was more popular when I worked,<br>
    and when I was worked on.<br>
    Now I hardly see my friend.<br>
    When he comes around he tells me of<br>
    &#8220;someday&#8221; and &#8220;somehow&#8221;<br>
    and I believe it every time.<br>
    Then he&#8217;ll cover me up and tuck me in<br>
    to my bed by the trashcans<br>
    and leave with a fond little pat that says<br>
    &#8220;I love you&#8221;<br>
    He does.<br>
    Trying to take care of his little rusty friend on the side yard.<br>
    The old, rundown pile of steel that someday he can be proud of.<br>
    I was the first car he ever bought.<br>
    I love you too.</p>
