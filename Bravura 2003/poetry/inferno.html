  <p align="center"><em>The Inferno Within</em></p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    The antsy intense fire rages<br>
    Deep within and burns its way<br>
    Thru my eyes and on the tips of my digits.<br>
    Its an anger that is strange to me<br>
    One I can't recognize<br>
    Don't want to.<br>
    It doesn't stop<br>
    It grows stronger.<br>
    The stronger it gets<br>
    The more I think<br>
    Its insanity just making a guest appearance.<br>
    As I lay there<br>
    It vanishes as quickly as it sparked<br>
    And I fall asleep<br>
    In the exhausted ashes of the fire.</p>
