<div align="center"> <em>Internet Dating</em><br>
  <p align="left">She is not the vision I once beheld.<br>
    Either mine eyes deceive or is my wit,<br>
    This beast of brawn to me has been shelled.<br>
    She is more of a man than I am fit.<br>
    She draws close for a hug like a long friend.<br>
    I hear my back giving way to the bear,<br>
    No longer can I stand straight, I must bend.<br>
    Looking again, I know not which eye to stare.<br>
    She moves in for a kiss and I feel sick,<br>
    I point to the stars and attempt to flee.<br>
    She pulls me close and I feel a small prick,<br>
    Her belt buckle, I&#8217;m as sure as can be.<br>
    &#8220;To Dinner,&#8221; as she lifts me in her arms,<br>
    The last time I fall for internet charms.</p>
