  <p align="left">I watch you from a safe distance<br>
    As you go about your daily routine<br>
    Wearing those leather pants that I love so much <br>
    You sit for a moment to fix your hair<br>
    Hair that I have imagined tangling between my fingers<br>
    As I whisper my confessions in your ear<br>
    You look into that myriad blue sky <br>
    Brown eyes shining with satisfaction, a smile playing on your lips<br>
    It&#8217;s a look I dreamed you would give me<br>
    If only I wasn&#8217;t so shy<br>
    I take a sip of my coffee<br>
    Fantasizing that the warmth of the cup was the touch of your hands<br>
    Reaching out for mine<br>
    When I look back up at you<br>
    You are sighing thoughtfully <br>
    What are you thinking about love?<br>
    I wish I knew what danced about your mind<br>
    That you would share your dreams with me<br>
    Have you noticed me before?<br>
    Have you seen me watching you with longing eyes? <br>
    You wet your lips now, a habit I have seen a dozen times before<br>
    (A habit that hasn&#8217;t exactly induced appropriate thoughts)<br>
    Do you know how that temps me?<br>
    How easily it makes me think I forget my shyness<br>
    And I feel I could just run to you<br>
    Pressing your lips against mine<br>
    The wind begins to pick up<br>
    Teasing your unbuttoned collar<br>
    Revealing the smooth, tan skin beneath<br>
    Beautiful <br>
    You can&#8217;t be real<br>
    And yet, you are here every morning<br>
    Getting ready to cross the same street <br>
    And I sit here in the coffee shop <br>
    Dreaming of a dozen things I could say to get you to look at me<br>
    &#8220;Excuse me sir ,but you dropped this&#8221;<br>
    &#8220; I don&#8217;t mean to bother you, but do you have the time?&#8221;<br>
    I sigh as I rest my hand on my head<br>
    The light turns green <br>
    You cross that street <br>
    And I smile<br>
    Words lost forever between us<br>
    Oh well, there&#8217;s always tomorrow</p>
