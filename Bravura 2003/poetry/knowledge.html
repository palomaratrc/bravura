    In winter the grapevine is a gray corpse: <br>
    withered, gnarled, twisting arms and torso in <br>
    a field of a thousand crucifixions. <br>
    <br>
    In spring the smallest of green buds break the <br>
    surface of the wood, re-igniting a <br>
    long slow soft explosion of shoots and leaves <br>
    and clinging tendrils reaching everywhere. <br>
    <br>
    In summer the vine's mardi gras of green <br>
    gazebos down to the ground, its swelling <br>
    bunches of plump sticky sweetness, pale gold <br>
    or purple, shaded in cool abandon. <br>
    <br>
    In fall the harvest robs the vines blind of <br>
    their reason to live, their leaves wither to <br>
    dry orange-brown and wind-scatter crackling <br>
    till pruning amputates the useless limbs. <br>

    In winter the grapevine is a gray corpse: <br>
    withered, gnarled, twisting arms and torso in <br>
    a field of a thousand crucifixions. <br>
    <br>
    In spring the smallest of green buds break the <br>
    surface of the wood: <br>
    No one taught them why, when, how, or what for. </p>
