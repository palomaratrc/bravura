  <p align="center"><em>Love Struck</em></p>
  <p align="left">Love comes suddenly, or so it&#8217;s thought,<br>
    You see the man across the way most sought.<br>
    And though you think life should be like a tale,<br>
    Thoughts of marriage turn him pale.</p>
  <p align="left">Ghostlike man, whom for which you seek,<br>
    Once so strong is now so meek.<br>
    The love you lusted for is gone,<br>
    After a week he must move on.</p>
  <p align="left">Utopia is lost as Atlantis is,<br>
    Looking for your treasure, you found his.<br>
    And now he wishes to stake his claim,<br>
    Dig down deep into your fame.</p>
  <p align="left">Snakelike he waits for the right time,<br>
    To commit his heinous crime.<br>
    Being a thief he&#8217;ll steal your heart,<br>
    Telling you he&#8217;ll never part.</p>
  <p align="left">But once beauty&#8217;s gone and youth has faded,<br>
    A fool to think he would have waited.<br>
    And so you&#8217;re left alone again,<br>
    Just you, some paper, and a pen.</p>
