  <p align="center"><em>9th grade hallway</em></p>
  <p align="left"> fumbled a bit right then-<br>
    apologize.<br>
    couldn&#8217;t get that button undone-<br>
    so sorry.<br>
    don&#8217;t make you excited-<br>
    please- forgive.<br>
    shut that mouth of yours-<br>
    over and over and over and over again<br>
    but you wouldn&#8217;t stay shut- you just didn&#8217;t know-<br>
    i could pardon the mistake-<br>
    but my class just started-<br>
    please- forgive.</p>

  <p align="center"><em>Crush</em></p>
  <p align="left">Wonder what it&#8217;d be like-<br>
    to kiss his crooked teeth. . . <br>
    remembering things he did<br>
    when he lost my keys<br>
    remember violent words<br>
    as we looked deep down in the gutter.<br>
    wipe my palms on my skirt<br>
    as he hikes it up &amp;<br>
    gives a little more that we&#8217;d<br>
    discussed.<br>
    Flip my hair and bite the tip<br>
    of my tongue-<br>
    Wonder what&#8217;s it&#8217;d be like-<br>
    to feel his eyes<br>
    all over<br>
    remembering the things he said<br>
    when he broke my heart<br>
    remember words he spoke<br>
    instead of kisses he gave.<br>
    ignore the cuts on my knees<br>
    as we get lost in the dark &amp;<br>
    feel our way up and down- over and over<br>
    again and again.<br>
    Pull on my shirt and lick the edge<br>
    of my lip-<br>
    Wondering what girl<br>
    is tasting those teeth<br>
    drowning in those stares.</p>

  <p align="left">sudden impact change in my life, there is no stop to this insanity<br>
    rolling around my head like i was playing ball with god, oh god<br>
    let this madness end within my soul. i love it too much, with so<br>
    much vigor, it is frightening to my virginity. i weep<br>
    i weep.<br>
    i correct too much. and if i were loved, would that change?<br>
    bones, would it matter much.<br>
    would it. oh how that there <br>
    were somewhere to escape you, me, all.<br>
    above and below if i were loved. to be loved.<br>
    inspite.<br>
    i love you inspite.</p>

  <p align="center"><em>Rhythm</em></p>
  <p align="left">he thinks he is a beautiful man.<br>
    You&#8217;re toying with my legs.<br>
    his world is topsy <br>
    That tickles.<br>
    he&#8217;s got only this to have<br>
    You&#8217;re destroying me.<br>
    his enemy-<br>
    This is one more shot in the dark<br>
    he found me as peaceful-<br>
    Did I miss?<br>
    his orchard of bees<br>
    Try again- closer this time<br>
    he&#8217;s so angry<br>
    Don&#8217;t let your hand shake-<br>
    belonging to the insider<br>
    This is an unsteady rhythm.<br>
    he is so insane-<br>
    The world fills this- BANG.</p>

  <p align="center"><em>talk</em></p>
  <p align="left">misplaced &amp; gone,<br>
    broken without a surface report-<br>
    winds are causing <br>
    distain,<br>
    misunderstandings &amp; remains,<br>
    petals of hope are drifting apart-<br>
    like glue it&#8217;s<br>
    drowning me.</p>
  <p align="left">And you seem to hurt too.<br>
