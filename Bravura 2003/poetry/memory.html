  </p>
  <p align="left"> By the sea I reminisce old flames of dying light.<br>
    Together the collection bends and then wanes.<br>
    Small moments disappear and I am left colder,<br>
    afraid of what has gone.<br>
    It is the ceaseless pounding, the infringement upon memory&#8217;s retreat, 
    which frightens me the most. <br>
    Where there was she and her luminescent ground of inspiration,<br>
    there is now only an echo.<br>
    Not of her, not of the times,<br>
    but of the same extinguishing waters approaching once again.</p>
