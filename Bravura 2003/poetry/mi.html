  <p align="center"><em>Mi Palomita</em></p>
  <p align="left">Like the tale of old, you came <br>
    And went.</p>
  <p align="left">I knew, but did not want to know.</p>
  <p align="left">You're a dove, with wings, that <br>
    Cannot be tamed. </p>
  <p align="left">You stayed to help me, to inspire<br>
    Me to go on, you gave me the faith<br>
    That I could.</p>
  <p align="left">And I have.</p>
  <p align="left">Without you I could not have <br>
    Done what I have. </p>
  <p align="left">You were my spirit, my hope<br>
    You gave me a reason to continue.</p>
  <p align="left">Your beauty, in and out, <br>
    Will always be in my heart.</p>
  <p align="left">You have left, taken to your wings, <br>
    To find what you are looking for.</p>
  <p align="left">Behind you left a man with sadness and joy, <br>
    For he knows now the joys of a person like you.</p>
  <p align="left">It is something not to forget, the joy<br>
    You brought to my life.</p>
  <p align="left">I was very happy while you were in my world,<br>
    Inside I knew you would not stay, and that <br>
    Is the sadness.</p>
  <p align="left">That is why you are Mi Palomita, I knew<br>
    Your wings would take you from me.</p>
  <p align="left">I will ways love you, for the person you are.<br>
