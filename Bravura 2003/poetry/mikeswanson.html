  <p align="center"><em>am i sky?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    am i sky?<br>
    is this why i see traffic and street <br>
    dreams on the floor?<br>
    and left behind me now </p>
  <p align="left">sky</p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    swimming in air could i still fly? <br>
    crickets piping last hellos of the evening <br>
    lonely little in the grass <br>
    building as the blue cloud dome above <br>
    shifts from noon shine to an orange <br>
    and orange hmmmm- </p>
  <p align="left">yes </p>
  <p align="left">orange red yellow scheme and <br>
    never seen in any tapestry <br>
    or in anyone's carpet</p>
  <p align="left">yes</p>
  <p align="left">and meanwhile she's sinking <br>
    and no more birds singing <br>
    songs breathing from heaven <br>
    into the higher centers of night <br>
    creatures waiting in hidden <br>
    places for the next twilight </p>
  <p align="left">waking with the dusk breaking<br>
    echo chirping flesh in rolling <br>
    wind and rain blood burning <br>
    hypnotic sky in my eye <br>
    and am i sky? during the <br>
    chimes of cocktail hour? </p>
  <p align="left">no intending entendres<br>
    no street dreams of jargon <br>
    and sidewalk am i</p>
  <p align="left">read?</p>
  <p align="left">and i watched as he turned <br>
    his bleary pinkish eyes to<br>
    the glowing milky way <br>
    to smile for the jazz violin<br>
    i watched him glaze over <br>
    and in his delirium <br>
    he was saying</p>
  <p align="left">&#8220;sorry fuck i&#8217;m<br>
    sorry love so far away and <br>
    sorry darling <br>
    sorry sorry starry sky <br>
    i am why am i sky? <br>
    didn't you know i'd crash like this <br>
    broken and spilling out like <br>
    marbles bouncing on spanish tile? </p>
  <p align="left">i know you always knew <br>
    i'd love you <br>
    straight to fantastic rose gardens <br>
    in countries where <br>
    there's no doubt in my mind.<br>
    thinking of you so far away <br>
    sometimes<br>
    chimes the hope <br>
    i'm on your mind <br>
    most times.&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">and again he's oblivious<br>
    and so decay he say<br>
    oops reclusive<br>
    sits up and falls <br>
    through the sky</p>
  <p align="left">lost in fleeting delirious memory photographs <br>
    missing someone trampled smear of dull <br>
    gray ooze over moonlight smiles and teasing <br>
    eyes staring into space in pain lonely and<br>
    secretly sad <br>
    he's alone again and tortured by the <br>
    beautiful images the morose song <br>
    of the jazz band <br>
    bass-drums-violin-trombone bleeding out <br>
    the notes clawing at his knuckles open <br>
    itching wounding running and running out of <br>
    time </p>
  <p align="left">left only with a fading <br>
    a photo collection <br>
    of magic lips inches apart<br>
    no peace and sleepless</p>
  <p align="left">no silence at midnight</p>
  <p align="left">no laughter</p>
  <p align="left">no morning</p>
  <p align="left">no twilight</p>
  <p align="left">and taking in budding moonbeams<br>
    <br>
    no color<br>
    <br>
    moon sliding softly down whispering <br>
    midnight goodbyes memories <br>
    flood in i am walking under the <br>
    moody starlight from aloof little jewels <br>
    sparkling between <br>
    behind cloudbanks<br>
    ages of brooding to heaven<br>
    but then there's night sounds and <br>
    colorless fields of rocks and wildflower <br>
    patches where cats are playing and a <br>
    little tom with white fur<br>
    pale blue eyes <br>
    and a face splashed with chocolate <br>
    comes close to examine my face <br>
    and my scent with raw animal <br>
    body language asks <br>
    'we friends?' <br>
    darts away from my fingertips </p>
  <p align="left">cool mist rolling in to kiss my eyebrows <br>
    gracing my cheeks and lips cold in the evening<br>
    smile at stars fading from view beyond the <br>
    shroud of fog </p>
  <p align="left">music flowing from the sky touching the <br>
    higher centers taking me with it <br>
    take me with you<br>
    to mind pictures and daydreams <br>
    coming in flashes of oblivion <br>
    silent in the ghostly mists <br>
    of the orchard </p>
  <p align="left">asking them </p>
  <p align="left">am i sky?</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><em>dream sequence 2</em></p>
  <p align="left"></p>
  <p align="left">I think I know why birds sing.</p>
  <p align="left">In worlds without sky there is never music- <br>
    no one ever brought music to ears clapping <br>
    hands chanting stomping feet pulsing drums <br>
    entwined together in magical patterns <br>
    or ever sang any song<br>
    or danced with each other <br>
    when there was no sky <br>
    and they saw no stars <br>
    and had only downward to look.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><em>lackadaisical in white</em></p>
  <p align="left">i am in the light<br>
    in the light<br>
    i see everything<br>
    sharp and clear<br>
    and technicolor</p>
  <p align="left">the light<br>
    covering everything<br>
    in a sheet<br>
    of the pure <br>
    and unafraid<br>
    and standing here <br>
    in the light</p>
  <p align="left">i am like the <br>
    oldest blind man<br>
    who sees beyond<br>
    himself beyond all<br>
    pettiness<br>
    indifference<br>
    suffering<br>
    and daily torture<br>
    and any color</p>
  <p align="left">stain</p>
  <p align="left">sunlight<br>
    blind voyeur<br>
    in the sunlight<br>
    clear and strong<br>
    and beautiful<br>
    as diamonds<br>

    jewel of<br>

  <p align="left">what&#8217;s in my eye?</p>
  <p align="left">shadows swaying <br>
    find the time</p>
  <p align="left">without moving<br>
    stop<br>
    start crescendo<br>
    play in tune</p>
  <p align="left">no one here saying<br>
    &#8220;Man OH MAN <br>
    where toooo?&#8221;<br>
    more and better</p>

  <p align="left"><br>
    when I was a boy<br>
    I slept on my<br>
    grandmothers<br>
    floor<br>
    and when I<br>
    looked at the<br>
    dark dark<br>
    shadows around<br>
    the &#8216;living room&#8217;</p>
  <p align="left">I dreamed up<br>
    demons</p>
  <p align="left">they were all<br>
    around me and<br>
    to this day<br>
    I don&#8217;t know<br>
    what they are</p>
  <p align="left">that sanguine quilt<br>
    went over my head<br>
    and covered me<br>
    and I hid from those<br>
