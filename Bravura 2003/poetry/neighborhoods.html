<p align="center"><em>The Neighborhood's Expanse</em></p>
<p>This aint no Left Bank, so I got to<br>
  write about what's around me<br>
  The neighbor-kids are puttin about<br>
  In some old pickup truck and<br>
  Honkin the horn in short bursts of <br>
  Youthfullness</p>
<p>&quot;Aint no one else to do it&quot; says I<br>
  philosohically<br>
  So the housing development goes<br>
  In across the road, soon to be<br>
  Filled with people that would call<br>
  The cops when all the neighbor-kids<br>
  Are acting in such ways called<br>
  &quot;Futility&quot;</p>
<p>I once had a dream that the neighbor<br>
  girl called out &quot;I love you!&quot;<br>
  And even now I do not know if it<br>
  Was any more than my imagination,<br>
  But what if it wasn't?<br>
  For never did I call back &quot;I shall<br>
  Make thee ivy garlands and beds<br>
  Of roses&quot; and every thing else<br>
  Marlowe promised his little<br>
  Nymph</p>
<p>Seems I can fly to my literary world quite<br>
  more easily every day<br>
  And here I expand my mind,<br>
  Maybe more than it should be<br>
  Just because no one else<br>
  Would do it if they had the<br>
  Chance at it; and in my<br>
  Mind's vast expanse, I realise<br>
  That the time is still only<br>
  Sunday.</p>
