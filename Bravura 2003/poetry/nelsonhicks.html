  <p align="center"><em>Margit Johnson Died Again Today</em></p>
  <p></p>
  <p align="left">Margit Johnson died again today.<br>
    I stood by her casket, <br>
    In a fashionable funeral salon<br>
    Frequented by only the best mourners,<br>
    Looking down at the red cheeked <br>
    Porcelain doll masquerade.<br>
    Her hair was frozen in a <br>
    Blond curly Q coiffure.<br>
    Her mother<br>
    That morbid bitch<br>
    Actually hired some ghoulish hair hacker<br>
    To butcher her fabulous mane,<br>
    Just a quick perm and a tease, Mommy<br>
    To bleach away the copper fire streaks<br>
    And fill in the holes with <br>
    Barbie peroxide gold.<br>
    Just the way her Mommy always liked it.<br>
    Goddamn her.<br>
    Margit Johnson died again today.</p>
  <p align="left"></p>
  <p align="left"></p>
  <p align="left">Her mother had her laid out<br>
    In a soft dress of petal pink,<br>
    That matched the salmon blush <br>
    On her fingernails.<br>
    I bet that black polish<br>
    Was a bitch to chip away.<br>
    The ruby stud in her nose<br>
    Had been stolen and blotted out<br>
    With mortician&#8217;s putty.<br>
    I don&#8217;t even want to think<br>
    What they did with her tongue.<br>
    I doubt you&#8217;d let that stay, Mommy,<br>
    What might the mourners say?<br>
    Notice how carefully, so daintily<br>
    Margit&#8217;s hands rest on her chest,<br>
    A planner to the end, Mommy,<br>
    One pallid palm cupping the other,<br>
    Holding tight to her breast a secret.<br>
    What a clever ruse, Mommy,<br>
    To bury the tattoo <br>
    <em>Margit&amp;Tammi 4Ever</em>.</p>

  <p align="center"><em>Stalking The Heron</em></p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    On a walkabout, in the silver mist<br>
    Of morning, chasing phantoms in my head,<br>
    Flotsam, fragments of dried dreams that persist<br>
    To weigh heavily on my brow like lead.<br>
    Ideas, vaporous sprites, tease to be <br>
    Crafted and sculpted into concrete form.<br>
    Fickle muses present themselves to me<br>
    And run away, laughing, in a brainstorm.<br>
    Cursed life! I turn away to find the lane<br>
    Blocked by a majestic plumed gray heron. <br>
    I am seized by the sight and must enchain<br>
    Its glory in ink somehow in fiction.<br>
    Struggling with my pad, I turn to see<br>
    The heron, like steam, fly away from me.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Tiger Inside, Burning</em></p>
  <p></p>
  <p align="left">I feel a tiger<br>
    Unwinding inside me<br>
    As he passes by.<br>
    Sunlight catches the<br>
    Amber fire in his hair<br>
    And I can feel the cat burning<br>
    Unfurling-<br>
    Stretching-<br>
    Flexing it&#8217;s claws<br>
    Making tiny pinprick<br>
    Tingles float down my thighs.<br>
    The wind carries his scent<br>
    Sweet and dry<br>
    Clean.<br>
    The tiger wets it&#8217;s lips<br>
    At the memory<br>
    And burrows it&#8217;s nose<br>
    Deep inside.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Visualize This</em></p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    Taking the advice of<br>
    Well-meaning PhD&#8217;s<br>
    Postulating that<br>
    True peace<br>
    Inner contentment<br>
    A meaningful life mission <br>
    Heaven<br>
    Can all be<br>
    Crystallized and<br>
    Realized<br>
    If we could only just<br>
    Visualize<br>
    It.<br>
    Having already invested 21.95,<br>
    (Thank you, Oprah)<br>
    I figured I had nothing left to lose<br>
    So I closed my eyes and<br>
    Visualized.</p>
  <p align="left">It is mid-morning,<br>
    The mystery of the day ahead of me.<br>
    I see myself, freshly showered,<br>
    In clean comfortable jeans,<br>
    A white linen shirt,<br>
    And a soft cardigan, rusty brown.<br>
    No shoes,<br>
    Only a pair of red plush socks.<br>
    I am sitting at the kitchen counter,<br>
    With the perfect cup of green tea.<br>
    My favorite journal,<br>
    The one with the cover of<br>
    Medieval tarot cards,<br>
    Waits at my elbow,<br>
    My truest friend<br>
    Of paper and ink.<br>
    In a batch of sunbeam,<br>
    The cat defies gravity<br>
    Draped on the windowsill.<br>
    He seems oblivious to the birds outside<br>
    Singing in the blossoming dogwood trees.<br>
    Or perhaps their songs<br>
    Have lulled the Beast of Cooper Street to sleep?<br>
    The dog has been walked successfully;<br>
    Three stops at two trees and<br>
    The neighbor&#8217;s BMW for spite.<br>
    Brian is at work;<br>
    The kids have been shuttled to school.<br>
    No one is sick, sad or angry.<br>
    Everything has been tucked away,<br>
    Breakfast dishes, laundry folded<br>
    The kitchen is spotless<br>
    And there is a faintly peachy smell in the air.<br>
    I am invigorated.<br>
    I am balanced.<br>
    That sublime period Mr. Poe spoke of<br>
    When one is in perfect Harmony<br>
    With Body and Spirit<br>
    Only then can one truly create Art.<br>
    I am in Sync.<br>
    My pen glides effortlessly over the<br>
    Waiting, willing paper, <br>
    The ink is like oil.<br>
    My penmanship is<br>
    Elegant, readable, refined.<br>
    Words are spilling<br>
    Falling<br>
    JUMPING onto the page<br>
    Like fat pink salon<br>
    Plucked out of a cold rolling stream<br>
    By the claws of Ursa Major.<br>
    Ideas, shadowy creatures envisioned<br>
    Are born gloriously perfect<br>
    Intelligent, witty<br>
    Fuckin&#8217; Brilliant!<br>
    I am focused<br>
    On track<br>
    Hitting the vein, in the zone<br>
    Found a purpose<br>
    Nirvana!<br>
    I stretch out my arms in exultation,<br>
    I am a Creator!</p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    And then I open my eyes<br>
    To crashing reality:</p>
  <p align="left">Last nights dinner dishes intermingle<br>
    With this morning&#8217;s breakfast.<br>
    I am wearing a thin Miskatonic tee<br>
    And sick-stained jeans, two days old,<br>
    With peek-a-boo holes in the ass.<br>
    Brian is gone<br>
    What else is new?<br>
    Brenna and Daniel are ill <br>
    With a cold/flu/stomach virus/leprosy<br>
    Take your pick.<br>
    They are screaming at each other;<br>
    I ignore them.<br>
    But what I can&#8217;t ignore<br>
    Is the cat in a psychotic rage,<br>
    (He&#8217;s been chewing the ferns again, dammit)<br>
    Crashing into the chairs,<br>
    Climbing up walls,<br>
    Burying his claws into<br>
    My exposed ankles. <br>
    I kick him off,<br>
    Determined to write something,<br>
    Anything<br>
    Scribble, jotting<br>
    Hell, I&#8217;d even settle for a half formed doodle at this point.<br>
    I hear someone barf in the other room.<br>
    Damn.<br>
    I&#8217;d slam my book in frustration if I could<br>
    But the damn thing is stuck to the countertop<br>
    By some kind of goo and<br>
    What is that smell? <br>
    The dog has crapped on the Persian rug.<br>
    I take a breath<br>
    Close my eyes<br>
    But all I can see now<br>
    Are red spots<br>
    Exploding arterial sprays<br>
    On the back of my eyelids.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><em>When You First See The Ocean</em></p>
  <p></p>
  <p align="left">When you first see the ocean,<br>
    You are in awe.<br>
    The sheer elephantine blue giantness of it all.<br>
    How it encompasses<br>
    The entire horizon.<br>
    The solid bigness<br>
    Of it overwhelms.<br>
    Once the senses have calmed down<br>
    And the size<br>
    Has become normal,<br>
    You slowly start to see:<br>
    A sailboat on the horizon.<br>
    Another one? Where did<br>
    That pop up from?<br>
    A surfer-<br>
    A swimmer-<br>
    A seagull diving for a meal.<br>
    Riding on the tips <br>
    Of the crashing crests<br>
    Are dark brown husks of coconuts<br>
    And wayward frisbees.<br>
    Your gaze comes in closer <br>
    And you see the<br>
    Bulbs of yellow seaweed bobbing<br>
    On the shore.<br>
    Rocks and broken shells<br>
    Tossed back and forth<br>
    In the tide.<br>
    Closer still, a small honey bee<br>
    Caught in the surf<br>
    Its wings wet and helpless.<br>
    You reach down with a <br>
    Twig you&#8217;ve found<br>
    To coax it to<br>
    Safety, dry land.<br>
    Its wings curl around its body<br>
    Encrusted in grainy bits of sand<br>
    So it can only slowly hobble away<br>
    Showing no gratitude.<br>
    You look back up to see<br>
    The ocean and, <br>
    Seeing it all at once,<br>
    Wonder how you could have ever<br>
    Been so blind before.</p>
