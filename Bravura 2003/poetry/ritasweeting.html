<div align="center"><em>The sixth day </em></div>
<p><br>
  No longer running I hang my coats to dry,<br>
  Upon the fence of Jerusalem and sit my faith, then cry.<br>
  The blue has once more entered; my shutters still see the storm<br>
  I cannot bury sorrow and will no longer morn.</p>
<p>Just stand and wonder, who is my friend?</p>
<p>Adeste Fidel&#8217;s! Come hither!<br>
  Jacques Brel, Calais, Pierre Argil let,<br>
  Gerard Sekoto pray for me?<br>
  I miss your kiss known and unknown<br>
  This day, the sixth.<br>
  This time betwixed the lines.</p>
<p></p>
<p align="center"><br>
  <em>The eighth day </em></p>
<p><br>
  When God chooses wisdom falls upon the soul like soft dew on the morning grass<br>
  Pearled and gleaming.</p>
<p>Suffering becomes a more bearable path; happiness is quiet contentment.<br>
  Love is not passion as much as thankfulness shared and joy is bursting strength,<br>
  Unbridled love for all.</p>
<p>On this eighth day I can see hope gleaming,<br>
  Brushing its hands ever so delicately across the bushes, blushing with its sunset.</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center"><em>The seventh day</em> </p>
<p><br>
  The aftermath of betrayal is bleeding!<br>
  Reddish feelings descend my chest.<br>
  My breast heave heavy thoughts,<br>
  Laden with unforgivness.<br>
  This seventh day has no outlet.<br>
  We must live her as though she were <br>
  Our lover, our impossible companion,<br>
  Who has brought on a curse of doubts?<br>
  Accumulating again and again with each<br>
  Moment we remember.</p>
<p>How was she this day? <br>
  When God rested but man went on <br>
  To fight the Lord, and pierce my heart<br>
  With trouble and distress!</p>
<p align="center"></p>

<p align="center"><em>For Reason (a love poem) </em></p>
<p><br>
  There is Love <br>
  And there are Loves<br>
  Ours is of Loves<br>
  Forever winged<br>
  Forever above soaring.<br>
  Together or apart<br>
  Always one<br>
  Forever love.</p>
<p>Your distances but dance<br>
  My changes but cadence<br>
  In rhythm</p>
<p>Be there fault <br>
  It knows but truth <br>
  Be there tear<br>
  It speak but of reaching</p>
<p>And beyond deep<br>
  Passion<br>
  Nothing know better <br>
  Heart, ecstasy and <br>
  Tenderness found</p>
<p>My love<br>
  Our love is fixed <br>
  In the mosiaque of <br>
  The Great Crying Wall</p>
<p>Jerusalem be ours<br>
  For love is true.<br>
