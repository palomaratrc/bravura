  <p><em>intimacy</em></p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    i doubt i would know the meaning,<br>
    if you were to turn and ask me,<br>
    but lying naked in his arms,<br>
    i fully understand intimacy. </p>
  <p><br>
  </p>
  <p><em>bones break</em></p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    you're inside of me<br>
    so during times<br>
    when it gets rough<br>
    you make me believe<br>
    and when bones break<br>
    i don't question why<br>
    cause i once thought love<br>
    could keep me up<br>
    but if i fumble then it's alright</p>

    <em>she didn't know</em></p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    so she wears her angst like<br>
    a ripped pair of jeans.<br>
    the kind that hug her hips,<br>
    the kind that make boys trip.<br>
    she wears her love like<br>
    a bleeding heart on the sleeve.<br>
    and in doing so,<br>
    i guess she didn't know,<br>
    she gave away all of her secrets.</p>
