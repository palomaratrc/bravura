  <p align="center"><em>Animal Parade</em></p>
  <p align="left">The swift flowing line of the animals dancing on high, <br>
    Above the lowest cloud and beyond the farthest path,<br>
    Caught the eye of the beloved opossum and her gang of rabbits.<br>
    They watched the gleeful spinning of the elephants,<br>
    And the rabid dance of the lily tiger.<br>
    Moving in and out of oncoming traffic,<br>
    They spun into a sea of out flowing mystery.<br>
    Spinning on edge to the highest riverbed,<br>
    Into the weary gushing waves of the lion&#8217;s nest.<br>
    Zebra&#8217;s joined the dance that caught the opossum&#8217;s eye,<br>
    And the lions trapped them all in their cave of death,<br>
    Save the opossum and her rabbit gang.</p>

  <p align="center"><em>Insomnia</em></p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    It sleeps inside us all,<br>
    the monster that creeps <br>
    into our dreams and <br>
    stalks our nightmares<br>
    without a single fear.<br>
    It chews away our minds<br>
    and gnaws upon our hearts.<br>
    forcing you to wake<br>
    in a cold sweat,<br>
    screaming for your life.<br>
    without you knowing<br>
    It&#8217;s keeping you awake<br>
    stealing your own sleep,<br>
    It waits&#8230;<br>
    It waits&#8230;<br>
    It waits&#8230;</p>

  <p align="center"><em>Nefesh</em></p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    Tiptoe through my garden,<br>
    do not tromp the fragile leaves<br>
    and harsh thorns of me.<br>
    Take each step lightly,<br>
    let the broken glass slip into your feet,<br>
    let it seep in and become a part of you<br>
    as it is part of me.<br>
    Reach into the rose bush<br>
    and pluck yourself a bud,<br>
    beware the bite of the gentle flower,<br>
    I warned you of its touch.<br>
    So soft, so sweet.<br>
    Smell the leaves <br>
    and feel your feet.<br>
    Wash your hands with the hose,<br>
    Wash your blood from the rose.<br>
    Clean your body, mind and soul,<br>
    and for a moment,<br>
    delve into my world.</p>

  <p align="center"><em>Silent Ritual</em></p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    She sits at the bottom of the hill.<br>
    You can see her between the stumps of <br>
    trees and the shadows of despair.<br>
    Perched upon a lawn chair vacantly staring<br>
    The blank shadows cover her shivering body,<br>
    and the stone in front of her <br>
    where her eyes are fixated.</p>
  <p align="left">Happy Birthday balloons whip through the wind<br>
    hitting each other in dead celebration.<br>
    The birthday wishes go unnoticed,<br>
    yet she still stares at the immovable stone.<br>
    Flowers wilt away but she never removes<br>
    her eyes from the stone <br>
    covering every inch in silent agony.</p>
  <p align="left">Tiny tears trickle from her eyes.<br>
    She does not bother to wipe them away.<br>
    She lets them roll down her cheek and <br>
    fall to the ground, screaming the whole way.<br>
    They splash on the same spot they did <br>
    years ago when she first sat here and cried alone.</p>
  <p align="left">Everyday she sits and stares.<br>
    She never speaks, and rarely moves.<br>
    Her eyes just stare in disbelief at the gray stone.<br>
    She watches the shadows <br>
    cover her stone, and then I am <br>
    forced to tell her to go.</p>
