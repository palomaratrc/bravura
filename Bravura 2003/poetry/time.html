    As the field mouse scurries through the field,<br>
    The eagle circles above.<br>
    Hiding periodically, then making a dash,<br>
    Back to the ones he loves.</p>
  <p align="left">He looks up,<br>
    Sees nothing.<br>
    Just then a talon appears<br>
    And the heavens begin to sing.</p>
  <p align="left">Time stops and it seems<br>
    As if the claw was frozen in front of him.<br>
    He stares in amazement,<br>
    Until all goes dim.</p>
