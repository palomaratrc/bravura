<div align="center"><em>Buena Street Bus Stop</em><br>
  <p align="left">Luna, I&#8217;m waiting for you.</p>
  <p align="left">The sidewalk is cracked,<br>
    And weeds fill in the gaps.<br>
    It reminds me of how the earth must look<br>
    After an earthquake&#8212;<br>
    Pieces overlapping and broken,<br>
    Fault lines snaking silently<br>
    Down Buena Street.</p>
  <p align="left">Others wait in the shade <br>
    Of a white brick wall,<br>
    Freshly painted, but a black signature<br>
    Loiters beneath the surface. </p>
  <p align="left">When the sidewalk is too crowded,<br>
    We stand in the empty dirt lot,<br>
    Watching the ground as we walk,<br>
    Stepping over fragmented glass<br>
    And sharpened pebbles.</p>
  <p align="left">A rusty chain link fence,<br>
    Strangled by thorny bougainvilleas,<br>
    Hides the train&#8217;s tracks<br>
    But does nothing to muffle <br>
    Its screaming arrival.<br>
    I cover my ears,<br>
    Hum to myself&#8212;<br>
    That song you learned<br>
    For the Christmas pageant. <br>
    &#8220;Little toy trains, little toy tracks&#8230;&#8221;</p>
  <p align="left">There&#8217;s one father here today.<br>
    Wearing a white shirt,<br>
    So thin that it threatens to rip,<br>
    Giving in to the force of his beer belly.<br>
    His shoes look like dry skin,<br>
    Sunburned and bruised,<br>
    Wrinkled from strain and age.</p>
  <p align="left">The rest of us are mothers&#8212;<br>
    So many mothers. </p>
  <p align="left">The ones from Mexico are easy to find.<br>
    They&#8217;re under five feet tall,<br>
    With thick black braids and smooth <br>
    Brown skin. Hard-boned noses.<br>
    They&#8217;re dressed in thrift store clothes:<br>
    A sweater a little too big,<br>
    Their hands lost in the long sleeves,<br>
    Pants a little too tight, <br>
    Their soft bellies creased.<br>
    They have toddlers on their hips, <br>
    Whose legs dangle freely,<br>
    Gently kicking their mothers&#8217; knees.</p>
  <p align="left">The young mothers smoke cigarettes<br>
    Across the street,<br>
    Their highlighted hair growing out,<br>
    Their acrylic nails half broken,<br>
    Their department store jeans <br>
    Fraying at the bottoms.<br>
    They talk loudly about men,<br>
    Or the puta next door.</p>
  <p align="left">There are also the stand-ins:<br>
    A friend, a neighbor, or<br>
    A daughter, like Rocio.<br>
    She dusts off a curb and sits down.<br>
    She&#8217;s wearing red sweat pants,<br>
    And a purple sweatshirt <br>
    With a cigarette burn at the cuff. <br>
    She squints down Buena Street,<br>
    For just a moment, <br>
    And then opens her book,<br>
    Murder on Thunder Hill.</p>
  <p align="left">Your bus is coming,<br>
    Teetering like a toy on the uneven road.<br>
    It pulls up to the curb,<br>
    Crunching Burger King wrappers.</p>
  <p align="left">I see you, Luna.<br>
    You&#8217;re the only one <br>
    Wearing a new uniform.<br>
    I can hear your laughter,<br>
    It&#8217;s like coins dropping&#8212;<br>
    When anyone hears it,<br>
    They turn and look.<br>
    Your hair is so straight, <br>
    Not like mine, wavy and kinky.<br>
    Your eyes are jalape&ntilde;o green.<br>
    Where did those eyes come from?<br>
    Mine are the color and shape of beans. </p>
  <p align="left">You are carrying something plastic,<br>
    With a paperclip tied to the end.<br>
    You see me and smile, tossing<br>
    Your arms into the air.<br>
    The plastic expands&#8212;floats unsurely,<br>
    Flipping in the breeze&#8212;<br>
    You twirl, following it, dancing with it.<br>
    And I hope for a moment<br>
    That you will never land<br>
    On Buena Street.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Happy Days</em></p>
  <p align="left">Angel sits on his broken <br>
    Futon with his fianc&eacute;, Mercedes, <br>
    Whose hair is tousled and tangled <br>
    In her fake gold hoop earrings. <br>
    His cigarette glares like an orange on fire,<br>
    The sickly sweet smoke inhaled greedily<br>
    By the walls of the apartment.</p>
  <p align="left">Once light blue with daisies,<br>
    The wallpaper is now gray,<br>
    And the carpet is matted flat<br>
    From too many strangers<br>
    Treading upon it.<br>
    The trashcan is overcrowded,<br>
    And so piles of unwanted<br>
    Bottles and paper plates<br>
    Huddle on the floor.</p>
  <p align="left">He hasn&#8217;t shaved for two weeks, <br>
    Maybe more. <br>
    But Mercedes doesn&#8217;t care,<br>
    And neither does the bottle of vodka,<br>
    Almost empty, in his free hand. <br>
    His eyes are like windows of abandoned<br>
    Houses whose lights have been shut off<br>
    After missing the rent.</p>
  <p align="left">Mercedes twists her engagement ring.<br>
    She imagines it twinkles,<br>
    But it doesn&#8217;t,<br>
    For there is no light<br>
    To illuminate the cubic zirconium <br>
    Pretending to be a diamond.</p>
  <p align="left">They say nothing.<br>
    Angel flicks on the television,<br>
    And their favorite show is on.<br>
    Happy Days.<br>
    Silently, he punches out his cigarette,<br>
    And tosses it into an empty beer can.<br>
    Angel wraps his arms around her,<br>
    And she snuggles into his bony body.</p>
  <p align="left">They fall asleep,<br>
    Watching TV,<br>
    Dreaming about <br>
    Happy Days.</p>
