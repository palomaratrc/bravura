  <p align="center"><em>Which Remains</em><br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">The soft places where<br>
    My induced evil had<br>
    Secured the jagged edges<br>
    Of its teeth<br>
    Are faded scars which have<br>
    Since melted into the tones<br>
    Of my own flesh<br>
    They fade, yet like so many<br>
    Times before, my heart<br>
    Falls inside the silence<br>
    Of anticipation, knowing such<br>
    Answers exist beyond<br>
    Vision and the only<br>
    Strength<br>
    I&#8217;ve ever been sure of<br>
    Is my love for you<br>
    Chills spill across me<br>
    Because at any moment<br>
    I would mangle the scabs<br>
    Of all which remains<br>
    Just to hold you again.</p>
