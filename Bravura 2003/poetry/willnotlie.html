<div align="center"><em>Will Not Lie</em><br>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">Come ask me why and I will say,<br>
    &quot;Please ask again some other day.&quot;<br>
    Against my will I wake again<br>
    Dreading sunshine and all the pain<br>
    I hold my breath one minute, two<br>
    No hope at all, I'm still with you<br>
    Tugging at my shame and sorrow<br>
    Back at it, same time, tomorrow<br>
    The sun's hot rays pierce through my soul<br>
    I'm blessed with life, but for a toll<br>
    One million people, maybe more<br>
    Have come at some point to my door<br>
    &quot;Don't be bizarre,&quot; they ask of me<br>
    I smile and nod with evil glee<br>
    If life's bitterness I must now swallow,<br>
    In turn for not becoming shallow,<br>
    I gladly gulp it down and sigh<br>
    &quot;Why not?&quot; I ask, I will not lie.<br>
