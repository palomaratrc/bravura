  <p align="center"><em>Withering Away</em></p>
  <p align="left">What do I see?<br>
    Well&#8230;it&#8217;s not what you see.<br>
    I didn&#8217;t think it would get this out of hand.<br>
    I still look fat!<br>
    I roar to myself,<br>
    as I pull my falling pants back up to my waist.<br>
    My skin is pale now.<br>
    My bones look like they are going <br>
    to tear through the flesh<br>
    and scatter across the floor.<br>
    I used to go to the beach<br>
    during those scorching summer days.<br>
    Eyeing boys with my crystal blue eyes<br>
    And tossing back long sun bleached tresses<br>
    That clung to my bronzed shoulders.<br>
    Now, I only hear the sounds of repulsion and fright,<br>
    as I drift by like a frail apparition.<br>
    If they only knew that I am frightened too.<br>
    My hair thinning,<br>
    Entangled in my hairbrush.<br>
    My eyes sunken into my face,<br>
    encircled by rings of dark shadows.<br>
    If I could, <br>
    I would smile,<br>
    and at least hide the pain from everyone;<br>
    but my transparent teeth<br>
    are only another thing to conceal from the world.<br>
    I look into the mirror,<br>
    but this isn&#8217;t me.<br>
    I&#8217;m dying here inside this withering flesh.<br>
