    I&#8217;m not done yet any more than the light is right and I deserve the 
    best switch scepter dainty holding dainty tips can paper thin cut just another 
    try peasant bow peasant a worthy peasant my kingdom forward onward slaughter 
    savor priceless exhaustion smear noble face down a cold wench&#8217;s rump 
    like a wall down to the floor against the world starring back starring into 
    <br>
    God <br>
    Against the wall and on the floor and a cold exhausted collapse leaves a stain 
    of face that can do the same forever better known as bitter punishment &#8216;A&#8217; 
    for a His Word to start us out toward forever in a money fold and paper crumple 
    waiting on the ink to drip out of the fist money crumple wait for the ink 
    to drip out exhausting rich doesn&#8217;t do strong sharp instead for a tiny 
    white line scratch that can disappear under a licked or better kissed thumb 
    bitter starving signature crawling parasite worm dragon eye can frown and 
    paper cut on a cold rump on the king&#8217;s lap His exhausted face smearing 
    from the wall to the floor.</p>
  <p align="left">Refused your request peasants have it best for knowing not never 
    show regret unless it&#8217;s a fist full worn thin and emaciated to ethers 
    under that cape that&#8217;s a robe on humble Friday no such thing as morning 
    after there&#8217;s too much smiling for to waste exhaustion trying for sad 
    to get away with it pink bends for purple hands buried for warmth then strangled 
    this purple is a crumple for pink folds anything you want whatever you say 
    sacred still despite ends meaning the best is not to come or send word or 
    keep safe instead it wallows for loose change a coin won&#8217;t burn drip 
    from a fist won&#8217;t buy any other shape won&#8217;t go out of style <br>
    God willing</p>
  <p align="left">Would hate to fall exhausted from a throne, paper cut scepter 
    in my hand like a switch pointing peasants the way they came the best is hiding 
    or has defied us all in a cold rump which we smear down like a wall to the 
    floor smooth and clean smelling please don&#8217;t stop listening so long 
    as please don&#8217;t say different by the time that please do not take up 
    more than a share in the name of scattered coins offered to cracks catching 
    me all the way from the wall to the floor catching like starring <br>
    God in the eye <br>
    with a copy portrait as king on a money note. </p>

  <p align="center"><em>Thinking on Immortal Insect Musk</em></p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    <br>
    With the greatest of certainty I tip my hat to the vice beneath it: good game 
    good day<br>
    Stale underarm and side-shaft musk counts days only half as well<br>
    as it speaks nights<br>
    Diluted apex of language accuses my vision of immortal sleep<br>
    Speech blames my fantasy of immortal sleep for it&#8217;s diluted apex<br>
    Circular evolution damned on the oval-obsessed <br>
    The eternal motion infatuations banished by circular evolution </p>
  <p align="left">Inconsequential fear is all that keeps me away: <br>
    from onto good job good work<br>
    Sore from powerful and meaningless themes but still alive<br>
    still living<br>
    There is something to be said for and slept on that immortals who sleep for 
    too long might have difficulty speaking well<br>
    There is something to be apathetic for and militant against <br>
    that mentally barren yet contently consuming organisms <br>
    are both what we have come from <br>
    and what we are going to</p>
