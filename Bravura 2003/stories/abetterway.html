</div>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are probably many ways to tell this story. 
  It could easily be told through his eyes, or hers, or mine, or yours, or a third 
  or even fourth party&#8217;s. Or instead, a mixture of them all might be combined, 
  leading one on to an interesting circus of points of view. After all, his account 
  might be very different from mine, yours, or somebody else&#8217;s. And if the 
  walls, and the ground, and the air, and other things inanimate in life also 
  had their say, even more details could be revealed. One might, for example, 
  be able to know exactly how and when the protagonist took a bath, what kind 
  of soap and shampoo he or she used (if any), what songs were sung, how efficiently 
  specific parts of the body were cleaned, and exactly how much water, down to 
  the last molecule, was used in the process. But such descriptions might take 
  away from what is really happening. One might get caught up in the overwhelming 
  details of life and miss out on the meaning. The subtext. The real story. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is better to see things through a perspective 
  that is less accurate in details and more true to what is happening. There is 
  clearly only one way to tell this story.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phone rang. The sudden interruption into William&#8217;s 
  rapidly spinning world almost scared him. Almost. Instead, he was left staring 
  upward, not moving from his amply cushioned bed to react, not answering the 
  phone just yet. He wanted to hold onto the dream above him for a little while 
  longer. It was his favorite part of any late night and no interruption seemed 
  worthy enough to end it short. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hovering just a few feet above William was Amber. 
  She existed in a context that impossibly placed her somewhere between his bed 
  and ceiling. Amber was there above him, dressed in the ultra short flower-dress 
  that William loved so much, twirling in an ever present early-summer Montana 
  wind, turning, charming. It was all happening once more on a bright hill covered 
  yellow with lady slipper orchids: a place William remembered so well. Amber 
  was playing the game of luring, purposely letting the slightly-cooled breeze 
  assist her in the effort. The wind cooperated by catching her hair and lifting 
  it up in display, combing out each shortly curled strand for William&#8217;s 
  desire. Her hair looked inviting enough to swim into. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
  William was ready. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if to mock him, the phone rang even louder. 
  It was enough to force Amber to run far off into the field, farther and farther 
  away until William could no longer see her. The empty space left by her then 
  faded quickly into the fan positioned on William&#8217;s ceiling. With Amber 
  prematurely gone, William contemplated flinging the phone across the room. His 
  better judgment stopped him just short and curiosity took over. It was almost 
  2:00 AM. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Hello!&#8221; He yelled into the phone&#8217;s 
  receiver much louder than he actually intended. The other end of the line provided 
  no reply other than thick, heavy breathing. The thought that a prank phone call 
  had interrupted his moment with Amber infuriated William. He repeated his &#8220;Hello&#8221; 
  with hopes of quickly discovering that this was not the case. The breathing 
  stopped. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Will? A rickety old voice asked. &#8220;William 
  Anding?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#8220;Yep, it&#8217;s me. What are you selling?&#8221; 
  William sharply replied. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Will, it&#8217;s you. I&#8217;m glad I found 
  you...so glad.&#8221; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William&#8217;s brain now dusted off all of the 
  appropriate memories so that the voice on the other end could be identified. 
  He knew who it was, though could not think of a name to match with the voice. 
  He was the worst at associating old acquaintances with old names. As a result, 
  he knew who it was without actually knowing who. Luckily he had help.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;It&#8217;s me, Mike Hartford. Amber&#8217;s 
  father.&#8221;<br>
       A silent pause.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Are you still there?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Yes.&#8221; William was still there, but 
  had great difficulty finding even the simplest response.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Will, I know it&#8217;s been a long time. 
  A long time since we&#8217;ve spoken.&#8221; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Almost four and a half years, Mike.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Has it been that long?&#8221; Mike now 
  quietly whispered. &#8220;It seems like you and&#8230;Amber, used to spend your 
  time together just yesterday. It&#8217;s amazing.&#8221; Mike&#8217;s voice 
  trailed off into silence.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If his memory had told him that this was Mike, 
  then William now began to question its competence. The Mike Hartford he had 
  known was a loud man, always assertive and strong during conversation. Something 
  was very different.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;How could the time have flown by so quickly?&#8221; 
  Mike unsteadily asked.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;It hasn&#8217;t for some of us.&#8221; 
  William replied.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike laughed. Not with a laugh that sounded as 
  if induced by any great humor, but more with a forced laugh that sounded like 
  it had struggled to make it past his mouth. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;That&#8217;s what I liked about you, Will. 
  You always had a good sense of humor. My own father used to say that a man who 
  can make people laugh has infinitely more power than a man who can only make 
  people cry. You could always make people laugh, Will. Always.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Well, I try, you know. I don&#8217;t often 
  succeed, but I try.&#8221; William replied.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Nonsense. I&#8217;ve never heard you burn 
  a joke before. You&#8217;re a natural.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I, uh&#8230;&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Tell me a joke, Will.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence. How could he respond to a request such 
  as this? At this odd hour of night? After so long? William did not think of 
  himself as a comedian and rarely was one to tell a joke. Now was no exception.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I could right now, 
  Mike. It&#8217;s pretty late.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Yes, of course it is. Very late. Too late.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a point to this call. Mike had something 
  to say. William wanted to know what it was badly.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;So what brings you here? I mean what made 
  you call?&#8221; William plainly asked. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pause that seemed like minutes followed. William 
  wanted to intervene in the near silence, but resisted. Mike&#8217;s breathing 
  once again began to grow heavy and audible. William waited.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Will&#8230;you heard about the accident?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;The accident?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;The car. All my fault. It&#8217;s my fault 
  how things are now.&#8221; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;The accident?&#8221; William again repeated. 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Amber&#8217;s mother is gone. Amber is&#8230;&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another pause. William distinctly heard what could 
  only be Mike taking a swig from a bottle. This was a side of Mike he more easily 
  recognized. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Will, you always loved her didn&#8217;t 
  you?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loved?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;You really loved my daughter, didn&#8217;t 
  you?&#8221; Mike added.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William&#8217;s heart instantly began beating 
  faster. How could he answer this? His lips parted and a simple answer came out 
  involuntarily. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;And you still do don&#8217;t you?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William&#8217;s left hand began shaking. His shoulder 
  followed.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Yes. I always will.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I knew it, Will. I knew it. I think she 
  did-does-too.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Mike?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I&#8217;m going to leave you something, 
  Will. Something that most people never get. Something both you and Amber deserve.&#8221; 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shaking traveled through William&#8217;s chest. 
  His heart began to feel as if it might explode.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I&#8217;m leaving you a second chance. 
  Everything. Take care of her.&#8221; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Mike?&#8221; William repeated.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I can&#8217;t&#8230;&#8221; Mike&#8217;s 
  thinning voice trailed. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William wanted to repeat Mike&#8217;s name again, 
  to say anything, but nothing came out. The other end of the line then ended 
  in a finalizing &#8220;click.&#8221; Immediately after, a steady dial tone filled 
  William&#8217;s ear. He let the phone stay connected to his ear for unknown 
  minutes. <br>
</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 months later</em></p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was morning. This was always the most tedious 
  part of the day. Little ever changed in order or procedure. But William never 
  complained, not even to himself. It was time with Amber: real time. That, in 
  any context, made William happy. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First was the change out of the colostomy bags. 
  This morning, Amber&#8217;s bag was more than half full with wastes her body 
  had processed overnight. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thank you very much.&#8221; William told 
  Amber as he replaced the filled bag with a fresh one. &#8220;I won&#8217;t know 
  what to do with such a prize.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William always made light of this part of the 
  daily procedure. He was positive that it was embarrassing enough for Amber to 
  have to go through the same routine day after day. Calling her collected wastes 
  a &#8220;prize&#8221; had become the norm and Amber always had a quick comeback. 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#8217;re welcome; don&#8217;t spend it all 
  at the same place. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William laughed. Though he had not actually heard 
  her say it, he believed that she had thought it. He had to. They were that close. 
  They always had been. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the colostomy bags came the bath. William 
  often sang to Amber during this long procedure in which he meticulously cleaned 
  her thin, wasted body in her specially built, invalid-friendly bath tub. She 
  had been a shower singer herself and William carried that torch for her now. 
  This morning it was two of Amber&#8217;s favorites: Whitney Houston&#8217;s 
  &#8220;I Will Always Love You&#8221; and The Village People&#8217;s &#8220;YMCA.&#8221; 
  William sang these renditions with great enthusiasm as he systematically cleaned 
  each of Amber&#8217;s limp parts. His off-key voice easily echoed beyond the 
  large, open bathroom, and continued on throughout the rest of the excessive 
  Victorian mansion Amber&#8217;s father had left him. As William washed in deeply 
  personal places, he called upon memories of Amber&#8217;s delicate singing voice 
  and allowed her to join in with him. The songs then become much more toned and 
  harmonious. Sometimes William wished they could just sing all day. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breakfast was no more exciting. Amber received 
  her food in pasty liquid forms which flowed directly into her abdomen through 
  a long plastic gastrostomy tube that resembled an umbilical cord. They &#8220;ate&#8221; 
  together at the table like any family might, except William always sat behind 
  Amber and her wheel chair so that she could not see what he was eating. Eating 
  eggs, bacon, and toast, Wheaties, or an orange, did not seem fair while Amber 
  only received that same grayish liquid. The only drawback from this routine 
  courtesy was that he knew Amber was always one who was curious about what was 
  happening behind her back. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are you eating?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Nothing special my love. Just the same 
  as you.&#8221; William replied to silence. He hated lying to her, but he felt 
  it was one of those necessary lies. To quickly change the subject William used 
  the repeated tactic of reading the newspaper out loud.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First he began with the small time local stuff, 
  and then he moved on to the arts and entertainment section, the sports, the 
  business section, the classifieds, the ads, the editorials, and then the bigger 
  headlines.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;&#8230;during which, the Governor said 
  he had no recollection of making any such promises about the budget when he 
  was running for re-election&#8230;&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finale was yet to come. After all of the world&#8217;s 
  news and other material in the paper had been covered, it was time for the comics. 
  At this point, William moved around in front of Amber&#8217;s stationary position 
  at the table and held the paper under her unfocused eyes so that she too could 
  see the comics&#8217; shorts illustrations. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;You know, I think it&#8217;s time we had 
  a talk- says Beetle Bailey.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Not now- says the Sarge.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;But it&#8217;s important Sarge- says Beetle 
  Bailey.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Beetle, I&#8217;m busy, I don&#8217;t want 
  to hear another word from your pie hole- says the Sarge.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;OK, then I won&#8217;t tell you about the 
  tank that just rolled over your new car- says Beetle Bailey.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William laughed loud. Amber, static and unmoving, 
  laughed loud enough on the inside for William to hear. They laughed together. 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the bad weather that had plagued much 
  of Montana this summer briefly seemed to be cooperating, William planned a walk 
  in nearby Orchid Park later in the morning. This too was often part of the routine. 
  It was also an excuse for William to see Amber in that short flower-dress he 
  loved so much. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early summer, the slight hills of Missoula&#8217;s 
  Orchid Park were always covered brightly in yellow. Somehow, a place that often 
  remained buried deep in snow for a large portion of the year glowed brilliantly 
  with life in the summer months. Yellow lady slipper orchids covered the skin 
  of its small hills and most of the short, flat distances in between, sharing 
  the ground only with sparingly positioned spruce trees and the animate guests 
  who were there visiting. It was a sight that William felt could not likely be 
  repeated anywhere else. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William took Amber to one of those yellow-clothed 
  knolls, parking her mobile chair just at its base, and then lying down himself 
  so that he could watch the expected blue and white wrestling above. As he relaxed 
  into a satisfying position and began taking the big sky view, he quickly realized 
  that there was one additional color above: gray. Contradictory to the weather 
  forecast that he had so clearly read out loud earlier this morning, premature 
  afternoon rain clouds were already beginning to threaten from the west. Coming 
  rain meant that he would soon have to wheel Amber back to their home, that place 
  of routines only a few blocks away. She would hardly have any time to take in 
  the scenery before it was already time to leave once again. But the small hills 
  and the island-like trees of the park were all theirs. There were no others 
  within sight. All of the park&#8217;s benches were unoccupied and no feet touched 
  its few paths. In such solitude, William knew the two of them could easily rest 
  here and reminisce when things were different.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confident that there was still time, William reached 
  over to Amber and closed her eyes gently with his fingertips. He then lay back 
  unto the orchids and let his own eyes close. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Just a few more minutes.&#8221; He whispered 
  to Amber. &#8220;I promise I won&#8217;t let it rain on you.&#8221; <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A powerful dot of water awoke William. It had 
  hit him square in the nose and then continued rolling into one of his nostrils. 
  In reaction, William quickly sat up, not immediately aware of his surroundings. 
  Amber was there next to him, fading from a dream of a dynamic woman whom he 
  had just been chasing through the hills and flowers, to the frail, wheelchair-bound 
  invalid of reality. Another rain drop sliced into one of William&#8217;s squinted 
  eyes as he attempted to comprehend this metamorphosis. As more rain drops began 
  falling, William finally understood where he was and what was happening.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he said to Amber 
  as he hastily stood up, intent on getting her home as quickly as possible. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was when it happened. As more and more rain 
  drops fell, William saw that they were no longer alone in the park. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man was well groomed and dressed in excessively 
  expensive business attire; the woman, too, appeared highly maintained, but was 
  dressed much more casual, wearing a short sun dress almost identical to the 
  one Amber now wore. This lead William to the speculation that the two had not 
  arrived here together.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attractive couple sat at a wooden bench within 
  50 feet of William and Amber. Despite this relatively close distance, they did 
  not seem to notice William now staring at them, or perhaps they did not care. 
  They were pressed tightly together, kissing passionately, and were clearly oblivious 
  to everything else around them. The raw passion the two shared entranced William, 
  holding his attention as the rain continued to fall. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moments later, William silently cursed at himself 
  for forgetting Amber. Quickly he reached over to her eyes and opened them once 
  again. He then titled her limp head so that her gaze involuntarily fell upon 
  the kissing couple across the park. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221; He said for a completely 
  different reason than before.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain fell harder and together they watched 
  as the couple consumed each other like a last meal. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Amber, you know that I would never have 
  left you.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I mean even after the accident, I would 
  have stayed with you.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knew. He was certain that she did. If Amber 
  could talk she would tell him that she was sorry that she had left him so long 
  ago. That it was a mistake. That it took something as horrible as the accident 
  and her father&#8217;s suicide to make her realize how she truly felt about 
  him. William understood all of this. He knew her like no one else could. He 
  knew what she wanted. And what she needed. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William began sliding his hands carefully through 
  Amber&#8217;s hair, taking in every detail of her soaked curls along the way. 
  After he felt his hands had amply memorized their details once again, he then 
  moved to her soft rosy cheeks. Gently he tilted her face upward so that it was 
  parallel to his own. He looked at that beautiful face, into those glossy ovals, 
  without blinking. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I love you.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love you too.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William then moved his lips slowly towards hers&#8230;<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a reason that a story like this should 
  be seen through his eyes and not mine. Who would want to know about how miserable 
  I am, always? The only point there could be to that story is that I want this 
  to stop. And it won&#8217;t. I am helpless to stop this from happening: to stop 
  him from loving me. Being loved unconditionally by someone that I discovered 
  long ago I cannot, will not, ever love is a horror that I never knew could exist. 
  Now it is life: one I have no choice but to live. This is why I prefer his point 
  of view. It is a better way to tell the story and it is a wonderful place to 
  be. Things are innocent there. The love is real. Life is grand. Who wouldn&#8217;t 
  want to exist in a place like that?<br>
