<div align="center"><em>A Need to Exist </em> 
  <p align="left"><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to exist was in the simplest of terms, 
    non-existent. There was no need, no desire, not even the smallest hint of 
    a will to live. But he did live. He still breathed. His heart still pumped 
    blood to all the parts of his body. On occasion he still slept and ate. He 
    lived. Time passed and he still lived. But he did not want to. He no longer 
    wanted anything. And yet he had no choice but to exist in this world. A world 
    that was indifferent to what he wanted. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn. Another day amongst trillions that had 
    existed and would exist. The sun rising was no big surprise. It was the same 
    routine: a mundane process without any significant changes. A reminder of 
    the seemingly never-ending life that he was forced to live. The man, the memory 
    of someone with a life, a job, a home, a family, and love, sat upon his high 
    roof-top vantage point studying the burning ball of light as it rose slowly 
    in the east. Far off mountains fought a losing battle to conceal the glowing 
    giant as it climbed higher and higher. The man smiled at the mountains&#8217; 
    futile efforts. He had tried the same thing many times, wished with everything 
    that another day would not begin, but of course always lost. On this morning 
    the mountains and the horizon off in the distance lost once again. Another 
    day had begun. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man smiled even deeper as a tear began rolling 
    down his beaten face. Today was not just another day. Today was also the last 
    day. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up, walked quickly to the nearby ledge 
    of the high-rise building&#8217;s rooftop, and stepped over it. Below, the 
    world suddenly grew a hundred fold. Not just because he was falling to it 
    at a rapid speed. It was a strange effect he had not foreseen. Everything 
    seemed bigger suddenly. Not just the streets below or the horizon in all directions, 
    but everything. The world beyond what he could see was stretching, swelling 
    past boundaries that had seemed so definite. Possibilities, absent only a 
    second ago, arose from every angle. Hopes suddenly overcame rapidly diminishing 
    fears. All matters of the past began surrendering to a born again future. 
    He could love again, with time. He could rise again. Start over. He could 
    follow his dreams and make new ones. It was all before him now. He could live. 
    He could deny time. He could, but as the world drew ever closer, he realized 
    he had made a mistake. A final mistake. He closed his eyes and screamed in 
    terror. It was over three seconds later.<br>
