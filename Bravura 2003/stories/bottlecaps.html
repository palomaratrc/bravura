  <p align="center"><em>Bottle Caps</em></p>
  <p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad use to always collect 
    bottle caps. I would sneak into his room when he was at work, and look at 
    all his shinny bottle caps. My favorite one&#8217;s were the bottle caps with 
    riddles on them. I think they were called Mickey&#8217;s. I didn&#8217;t care 
    though, I only thought of the cap as the way it was in the present. I would 
    spend hours searching for a new bright cap whose existence I had no previous 
    knowledge of till that moment. It was like a mini-gratification of my curiosity, 
    which spent hours dreaming of far off lands I had never seen. Yet my yearning 
    to visit them was so powerful, that it was as if I had lived there as a younger 
    boy and had been removed suddenly from my blissful home. Oh, how I had dreamed 
    so many times of running through the beaches, and through the crystal clear 
    water with no fear, only thinking of how high I could splash the water. It 
    was like my discovery of a new bottle cap expanded my view of the world around 
    me, brought me closer to those far off places. Maybe it was just that I was 
    feeding my basic human urges to learn and understand more of the world around 
    me. Yet none of this was I aware of at the time. I could not attach such restrictive 
    words to what I was experiencing, and was only capable of experiencing it 
    through basic childish emotions. For example, I felt the glee and curiosity 
    of a boy opening a present, however the knowledge I unknowingly obtained from 
    the experience stayed with me far longer than any materialistic gratification 
    ever could. It was as if I was playing out through the simple act of searching 
    through the bottle caps, the intricate search I later bestowed upon myself 
    through the living of life. The search for something greater than yourself 
    that&#8217;s identity you have no idea of, yet your convinced you will know 
    what it is when you find it. I never got the chance to search through the 
    bottle caps, and really ponder on it with a more evolved intellect. My dad 
    left one day to work, and took his bottle caps with him. He never came back, 
    and for years I could only remember the bottle caps as an evil reminder of 
    the pain inflicted on me by my father&#8217;s abandonment. But finally I&#8217;ve 
    come to understand it for what the memory really was. A mere step in the never 
    completely built stairway I affectionately call life. Now what I ponder on 
    is where the blue prints to this stairway are, and why I&#8217;m forced to 
    build it without the complete knowledge of how to accomplish such a feat.
