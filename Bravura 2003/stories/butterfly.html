  <p align="center"><em>The Butterfly Man</em></p>
  <p></p>
  <p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two old friends sat together 
    sharing what little shade they could find on a hot July afternoon. Not much 
    conversation passed between the two men; they were content to let the sun-crazed 
    buzzing of the junebugs fill in the silence. Afternoons here on Cleveland 
    Kohl&#8217;s porch were usually passed in just this fashion and both men, 
    Cleveland and Orville Pickins, liked it that way just fine. So, you can imagine 
    Orville&#8217;s surprise to hear his old friend suddenly break with tradition 
    and say, &#8220;Wulllllp, there he goes again.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Orville stopped chewin&#8217; on his toothpick. &#8220;What&#8217;s 
    that, Cleve?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;That fool Butterfly Man over there, Orville.&#8221; 
    He pointed across the porch with a gnarled finger. &#8220;He&#8217;s right 
    there over in McFarland&#8217;s cow patch, ya dang fool, can&#8217;t you see?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Orville squinted up his face and nodded, looking 
    for the life of him like a chihuahua in overalls. &#8220;Of course, I see 
    him now, Cleveland.&#8221; he lied. &#8220;Just had the sun in my eyes is 
    all.&#8221; He knew his eyes were getting bad but he didn&#8217;t want some 
    old fart like Cleve knowing all about it. It was bad enough his old woman 
    was always on his back to go and see some eye doctor. He squinched up his 
    face tighter and damned his old eyes. &#8220;I bet old man McFarland&#8217;s 
    gonna raise some hell when he sees that fella over there on his land. Gonna 
    be some shootin&#8217;, I bet.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cleveland sat back, his hands over his belly and rocked 
    his chair slowly. &#8220;Naw, there won&#8217;t.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orville looked over towards his friend; he could 
    see it coming. Cleveland sitting there, rocking with his hands held tight 
    across his belly. That&#8217;s how you could really tell: Cleve&#8217;s hands. 
    If he kept them open to his sides, there was nothing to worry about, just 
    friendly conversation and shooting the breeze. If he started wiping his face 
    as though he was sweating when there wasn&#8217;t a sun in the sky, that spelled 
    an argument brewing. But when he kept them tight and close to his chest, like 
    he was holding a winning poker hand, then Orville knew there was a story coming 
    up. So, Orville smiled and played his part. &#8220;Now how the hell would 
    you know that?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleve looked over at Orville and spit a dark 
    stream off the porch. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t nothing new. I&#8217;ve seen him 
    once or twice before over in that field. He&#8217;s butterfly huntin&#8217;, 
    see? That&#8217;s why I call him the Butterfly Man.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;If he&#8217;s so common how come I ain&#8217;t 
    never seen him before?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Guess you weren&#8217;t lookin&#8217; before. 
    I wouldn&#8217;t&#8217;ve noticed him myself if it weren&#8217;t for my old 
    lady Mae showing him out to me. She saw him once or twice a summer before 
    she passed on, God love her.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleve closed his eyes. Orville squinted up his 
    little Chihuahua face and looked on towards old man McFarland&#8217;s field. 
    The sun was at about 3&#8217;oclock so it wasn&#8217;t anywhere in his eyes 
    but he&#8217;d be hanged if he could see a damn thing over in that field but 
    overgrown weeds and a dying old tree.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There weren&#8217;t no Butterfly Man nowhere.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Yep, he&#8217;s a sight, ain&#8217;t 
    he?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orville jumped at the voice. &#8220;Yep&#8230;..that 
    he sure is.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I figure he must pay McFarland a pretty 
    penny to go jumpin&#8217; around in his fields. I&#8217;ve never heard him 
    complaining about it. Lord knows he grips about everything else.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orville chuckled deep in his chest. &#8220;McFarland 
    is a rascal, tight with his money., that&#8217;s for sure. But what do you 
    suppose that man does with all those butterflies? Think he&#8217;s one of 
    them people that kills &#8216;em and hangs &#8216;em on the wall?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Don&#8217;t know about that. Never had 
    the mind to go up and ask him. In my opinion, I have to agree with Mae. She 
    used to say it was cruel what he was doing out there. &#8216;Butterflies are 
    like souls&#8217;, she used to say, &#8216;they aren&#8217;t something to 
    be netted and collected into jars.&#8217; The kinds of people that would go 
    and do something like that is sick.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Well, just take a look at a butterfly. 
    They don&#8217;t harm nothin&#8217;, don&#8217;t get anybody&#8217;s way. 
    Why kill them? My Mae always loved butterflies. I remember how she&#8217;d 
    embroider them on those fancy pillows that she sold at the flea market. Remember 
    them, Orville? They were always so pretty.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Yessir, Cleveland, you married yourself 
    a fine woman. A fine woman.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;And wasn&#8217;t she a sight? All her 
    life. Never did stop shining.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;As pretty as a picture, if I can say 
    so. Yessir, she was that.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleveland looked down at his hands and stopped 
    talking. Orville stayed quiet and turned his face away from his friend. Some 
    things were just meant to be done in private.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleveland pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket 
    and blew his nose loudly. &#8220;I&#8217;m getting&#8217; too damn old when 
    I start crying like a baby over nothin&#8217;.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;We&#8217;re never too old to remember, Cleve, 
    and, well&#8230;sometimes that&#8217;s enough.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s the gospel truth. 
    This happens to me every time I see him over there jumpin&#8217; and wavin&#8217; 
    that fool net of his around like it was Old Glory. I watch him for a spell 
    and then I start to remembering and then I&#8230;oh, hell.&#8221; He pushed 
    himself up from his rocking chair. &#8220;Don&#8217;t go on listenin&#8217; 
    to me make a dang fool outta myself, Orville. Come on inside and let&#8217;s 
    get us a beer or two. It&#8217;s starting to get too hot out here anyway.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Naw, Cleveland, thank you kindly but 
    it&#8217;s getting late. I&#8217;d best be getting on towards home if I want 
    to get a few chores done before suppertime.&#8221; Orville stood up and lightly 
    fingered the oil stained bill of his cap. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you come 
    on over and have supper with the old lady and me? She&#8217;d be sore with 
    me if I didn&#8217;t ask you.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleveland&#8217;s face dropped slightly. &#8220;No, 
    thank you and the missus but, no thanks. I&#8217;m feeling a might tired. 
    I think I&#8217;ll just go lie down a spell until I feel better.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orville eyed his friend. &#8220;See ya tomorrow?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Tomorrow.&#8221; Cleveland said and waved 
    his friend on.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Orville had gone far enough down the lane 
    to be out of sight, Cleveland went inside, grabbed a beer and sat back down 
    in his rocking chair. Cleveland rocked slowly, back and forth, back and forth. 
    A solid white cloud shrouded the sun and cast a shadow over his face as his 
    head fell to his chest. The bottle he held in his hand fell heavily and rolled 
    across the porch. A hoot owl hooted in the distance and a breeze blew through 
    his cotton white hair. The figure in the field continued on with his St. Vitus 
    dance amid a circling whirlwind of colors. The mesh of his net billowed out 
    like a cloud as he reached towards a passing butterfly.</p>
