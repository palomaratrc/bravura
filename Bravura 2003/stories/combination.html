  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kick the soapbox aside as today 
    loud and clean will not be enough. Clear your throat into the spotlight, and 
    if you might be speaking to yourself then your pedestal might as well be personalized. 
    Step up onto a stack of smut magazines piled high on the toilet seat. </p>

  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is misogyny, the hatred of 
    women, so very like scatology, the study of or in this case the obsession 
    with, feces? Apart from the general unpleasantness associated with both terms, 
    those who regard women with hostility are often preoccupied with the same 
    issues that can bring all things fecal into a kind of comic if not spiritual 
    reverence. These people, the misogynists and the scatologists, are normally 
    not women, however, they are normally not men either; they are both lingering 
    boys. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freud once stated that, particularly to the 
    dreaming mind, gold is shit, symbolically. By this connection are men who 
    shower their women with jewelry in fact trying to subjugate if not entirely 
    degrade them? If so, then it could also be suggested that a man literally 
    defecating on a woman actually means to lavish wealth and reverence on her. 
    Despite what Freud knew, it brings to mind the dynamic between socializations 
    of women as delicate icons to be worshiped or beasts of burden to be enslaved. 
    Through separation of the sexes many men become fixated on these ideals long 
    before puberty&#8217;s new emotions can challenge or violently invert their 
    perceptions. Upholding the truth or damning the lie of either extreme becomes 
    a man&#8217;s testament to what they asserted during childhood. This is often 
    one of many ways to further pamper the boy who wasn&#8217;t ready to grow 
    up. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on that same note of pampering, we can wipe up 
    another of life&#8217;s earliest lessons. Bodily discharges are associated 
    with poor hygiene, thus bad manners, thus they are the first and most easily 
    accessible weapons of rebellion. Before children learn about sex, every joke 
    and insult revolves around toilet and the harnessing of gasses they&#8217;ve 
    been taught to excuse or keep subdued. Boys soon find they can gain power 
    with a pull of a finger even when they cannot get it with the strike of a 
    fist. One long laugh can erase a hundred scowls, and as men grow jaded or 
    overwhelmed with &#8216;grownup jokes&#8217; they frequently fall back on 
    those familiar yet always personalized stenches. This humor is at the base, 
    at the beginning, and thus always at the top, a willful smile for the shocked 
    or disgusted faces and all the miserable growing up they represent. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real Peter Pan would have flown around with 
    a little flap open in the back for extra propulsion and even a bomb or two. 
    He&#8217;d have never let Wendy join him, whether to keep her out of danger 
    or to keep her on the ground. If there is still any doubt on the common origin 
    of misogyny and scatology, just look at how men still express their anger 
    or contempt. All curses, with exception to the spiritual ones, revolve around 
    either bodily function or reproductive dysfunction. It is no great surprise 
    that the &#8216;s&#8217; word and the &#8216;f&#8217; remain our dirtiest. 
    The toilet shines as man&#8217;s first triumph just as the bedroom remains 
    man&#8217;s most enduring challenge, and he must either work within society&#8217;s 
    rules for them or dwell on the memory of when he could make his own. And perhaps, 
    when impotent and in diapers, these men might remember their wives and mothers 
    more fondly. </p>

  <p align="left">Put the soapbox back where you found it so that someone else 
    might have a turn and a shine. Make good use of that toilet and use the pages 
    of those smut magazines as you will. </p>
