  <p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh for fuck's sake! Give 
    it a rest, will you?&quot; I snapped into the receiver.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No! I swear to God, I'm gonna do it this 
    time!&quot; Her voice was shakier than a junkie&#8217;s hands.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Dammit, Suze! Listen to me . . . &quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm serious! I'm serious!&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sighed. This was the third one of these phone 
    calls I'd received this month. What was worse, she was screaming into the 
    receiver loud enough for my friend Will to hear, and he was sitting on my 
    bed across the room. He was laughing his ass off.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put my hand over the mouthpiece.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is not funny.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at me, and then laughed even harder. 
    I gave him the finger.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Please,&quot; Suzie was begging, &quot;please, 
    just come over. Just for a little while.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Suze, we aren't together anymore, get 
    it? I am not coming over . . .&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why not?&quot; she was screaming again.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Because we are not together an-y-more! 
    I am really getting tired of you pulling this shit.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Please . . .&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;SUZIE! No! Look, if you need to talk to 
    someone this bad, why don't you just talk to your mom or something?&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Please . . .&quot; she was sobbing now.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No!&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fine! Fine! I'm going to do it.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I paused. Calm down . . . to hell with it.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good! Do it! Put yourself right out of 
    my misery! You&#8217;ll be doing the both of us a favor!&quot; I shouted and 
    hung up the phone. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I don't really consider myself a jerk, 
    at least not to the extent most other people do, but I have to say, I probably 
    could've handled that better.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That was fucked, man,&quot; Will said. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You need to shut up.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm just saying . . . ouch. That was harsh.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Put yourself in my shoes, will ya? She's 
    been doing this like every other day since we broke up. Two months ago. I've 
    been dealing with this for two months, man!&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, by the way, was not the reason Suzie and 
    I broke up. Her &quot;suicide fits&#8221; didn't start until after we broke 
    up. We broke up . . . Well, I dumped her because she boinked like half of 
    the basketball team. I do not play basketball.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She's probably gonna do it, now.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rested my head in my hands and took a deep 
    breath.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Shut up, Will.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Seriously.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The phone started ringing again.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No way,&quot; I said.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It can't be her. She's gotta be way busy. 
    Killing herself and all.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If that were even slightly funny . . . 
    &quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Relax, she's not gonna do anything. Watch.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached for the phone.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't!&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hello? Oh hi, Suzie. No, this is Will. 
    No, no, he stepped out. Um, I don't think so. He takes pretty big steps. Long 
    legs and all that. No, I don't think he's avoiding anybody. Ha ha, I'll tell 
    him you said that. Right. Okay. Talk to you later. Bye.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hung the phone back up.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She says she's naked and she's thinking 
    about you.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've known Will for ten years -half of my life. 
    He&#8217;s the only human I have ever met who is completely incapable of being 
    serious. You think people born without a sense of humor are hard to deal with? 
    You don't know &quot;hard to deal with&quot; until you meet Will. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Will, if you don't tell me what she really 
    said, I will hurt you.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She said you were a prick and she couldn't 
    believe she wanted to kill herself over you.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Really?&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Will, not today. Please.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay, okay. Man, you're so boring sometimes. 
    She said she was sorry for freaking out and that she wasn't going to do anything.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Not joking?&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not joking.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;'Cause I will kick your ass. Twice.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Dude, I'm not joking.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wasn't joking. You have to force it out of 
    him sometimes (usually with threats of physical violence), but you can tell 
    when he's telling the truth.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was surprisingly relieved to hear this. And 
    a lot less angry. I almost felt bad, actually.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You don't feel bad about what you said, 
    do you?&quot; he asked.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hell no.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good. But if you'd said that to me, I 
    would've killed myself.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're not gonna need to, buddy. Just 
    keep talking.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We laughed. I was feeling much better.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Hey,&quot; he said, &quot;we gotta split 
    if we're gonna meet Angela and her friend at The Red Light.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked at the phone.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You really think she's cool now?&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think she was cool from the beginning. 
    I think she's just been doing it to wrack your nerves. Get back at you for 
    breaking up with her.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You think?&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She'd have done herself by now if she 
    were serious.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It made sense.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Makes sense. What a bitch.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;C'mon. Let's get out of here already.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah. Lemme change my clothes.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We met Angela (Will's girlfriend) 
    and Maggie (Angela's friend) at Angela's place, and then drove over to the 
    bar. It was cold outside, but surprisingly enough, Maggie was wearing a vinyl 
    mini-skirt and a blood-red halter top that said &quot;princess&quot; or &quot;goddess&quot; 
    or &quot;matriarch&quot; or something. I should've taken that as a sign.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; she said to me, &quot;all 
    my friends call me 'Machine Gun Maggie'.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I waited for her to elaborate.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Cool, huh?&quot; she said.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh yeah. And so much easier to say than 
    just Maggie.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled at me like she was on nitrous oxide.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; I said, &quot;Well uh, Will 
    and I are just gonna go out for a smoke. Will! Yeah, we'll be back in a minute. 
    Uh, wait here, I guess. Later.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I grabbed Will by the arm and ushered him to 
    the back door. He was on his way to being quite drunk.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What up?&quot; he asked me when we got 
    out into the alley.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lit a cigarette then offered him one. He took 
    it. He only smokes when he's drinking.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Hey dude, about Maggie . . .&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She's pretty cool, isn't she? She's hot 
    too,&quot; he said.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;She's either mildly retarded or completely 
    insane.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You noticed?&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You knew?&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;She introduced herself as &#8216;Machine 
    Gun Maggie&#8217; Will! What the hell is that?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I dunno man, she does that with everybody.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Dear God.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Aw, forget about it man. She's really 
    a sweet girl, and I guess she told Angela that she wanted to get laid tonight.&quot; 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Really?&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah man, honest. You might get lucky 
    tonight if you're cool.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, that's really what I need. Sleeping 
    with more crazy people.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She's not crazy. She's blonde.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm blonde.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, I know.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I finished off the cigarette and then ground 
    it out with the toe of my shoe.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd never met anyone with a negative IQ before. 
    It's an amazing thing. It was like the little brainpower that was left among 
    the sentient of us was being sucked out of the air as we spoke. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Yeah man,&#8221; I said, &#8220;this 
    guy was gone. I mean, &#8216;Jerry Garcia&#8217; gone. Long gone.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;No shit?&#8221; said will, &#8220;at 
    school?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Yeah. Guy&#8217;s a complete brain-donor.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Maggie: &#8220;My feet move when I 
    talk.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I almost felt bad for coming on to Maggie as 
    much as I was. &quot;Almost&quot; because she was coming on to me just as 
    much if not more. She was dumb, yes, but she knew what she was doing. I was 
    looking forward to a long and sleepless night. And then the inevitable happened.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You know Suzie?&quot; she said suddenly, 
    and from her blank expression it was hard to tell if it was a question.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh, Suzie?&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shit.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Um, yeah, I guess I do. Why?&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You're not that guy are you?&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What guy?&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That guy. The one who didn't play basketball.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess now's a good time for me to say that 
    I am not a violent drunk. I'm not an angry drunk, either. I'm not even an 
    obnoxious drunk. I'm a happy drunk. Well, I was until like five seconds ago.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I guess that's me.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wow. You seem really nice to me.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I flinched.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What?&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Suzie said that you were an asshole.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's no real point in listing my responses 
    in this next bit of the conversation. They were mostly &quot;what?&quot; or 
    &quot;huh?&quot; or &quot;Jesus Christ.&quot; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, she said you were a real SOB. A 
    real jerk. Yeah, I know! I can't believe it either! You're like the nicest 
    guy I've ever met. What else? Uh, she said . . . um, I don't think you want 
    to know . . . She said you were a terrible lay. Okay! Relax! How should I 
    know that? Well, I dunno. I don't want to make you mad. Well okay. Um, she 
    said you were cheap and boring. No, I don't think so. She said lots of things 
    like that. I dunno. I don't really remember any more specific stuff. When? 
    Oh jeez. The last time I spoke to her was like . . . at least six months ago.&quot; 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six months? <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six months. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six months! <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six months!<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, Will. You hear that? Six months man.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will said nothing.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Jesus.&quot; I said.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's the matter? Did I say something?&quot; 
    Maggie asked.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No. Don't sweat it. No big.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Are you sure?&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah. Hey, come here.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she leaned over the table I grabbed her by 
    the shoulders and kissed her. I felt her tense up. For a second I thought 
    she was going to pull away. She relaxed, though, and then got into it herself. 
    I kissed her hard. I kissed her the way I wanted to hurt Suzie. I kissed her 
    until closing time.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yo, oxygen twins,&quot; Will said, tapping 
    me on the shoulder.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't stop. I gave him the finger.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Come on, break it up. Hey! We need to 
    get home, you guys.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pulled away from Maggie slowly. She didn't 
    want to stop either.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You are a pain in my ass.&quot; I told 
    Will.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Are you okay to drive?&quot; Angela asked.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; I said.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked out to my car. Maggie and I climbed 
    into the front, Will and Angela in the back.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay, who's going where?&quot; I asked.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I go where she goes,&quot; said Will, 
    pointing at Angela.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Where we goin' Angela?&quot; I asked, 
    trying to look sober as I looked at her in the rear-view.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh, back to my place I guess. Maggie, 
    what about you?&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We quickly glanced at each other. Then stared 
    straight ahead out the windshield.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Back to your house, too. Yeah.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; I said. I knew she would change 
    her mind when we got there if I was cool and suave. I started the car and 
    turned on the radio.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, the sweet sound of Van Halen. I was just 
    starting to get into the tape when Maggie asked if she could put something 
    else on.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What?&quot; I asked.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't really like this music.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What, Van Halen? How can you possibly 
    dislike Van Halen?&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's not really that good.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A silence filled the car as &quot;Jump&quot; 
    faded out and &quot;Hot for Teacher&quot; began to fade in. It was that kind 
    of silence you get in movies like when the geeky white kid shows up at the 
    party and says something like: &#8216;Yo, yo, yo! Where all da bitches at, 
    dog?&#8221; It was that kind of silence. I could almost hear the crickets.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kept my cool.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There's a box of tapes under the seat.&quot; 
    I said<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bent over and pulled the box out. Each time 
    she picked up a tape and looked at it she clicked her tongue. As much as I 
    liked it before, I was beginning to really dislike that tongue. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pulled a tape out and held it out for me 
    to see.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's this?&quot; she asked.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I dunno. What's it say?&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh . . .'Mudvan'?&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;'Mudvayne'.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh,&quot; she said, putting it back in 
    the box, and then pushing the whole thing back under the seat.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat there a moment. Quietly. I listened 
    to David Lee Roth make crude school jokes.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Can we listen to the radio?&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want you to think I'm an asshole, but 
    look at it from my perspective. I just learned some really upsetting things 
    about my ex-girlfriend not two hours ago. Granted it was all over and done 
    with and done with between she and I, but it was still upsetting none-the-less. 
    Also, I had to really concentrate on driving because I was completely wasted. 
    There had to be some kind of noise to drown out Will and Angela in the backseat 
    so I could keep concentrating on the road, not on them. That noise happened 
    to be one of my favorite band's most glorious albums, and this chick who I 
    didn't really know that well is telling me they suck, along with all my other 
    favorite bands. Mudvayne does not suck. No, she was not going to put on the 
    radio.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Touch the goddamn radio and you're walking 
    home.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's not how I meant to say it. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was more of that silence.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Look, Maggie,&quot; I said. &quot;It&#8217;s 
    nothing personal, right? I'm just a little out of it. What station do you 
    listen to?&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Never mind. It's okay. This is okay.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, well done.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh . . . right.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, after half-an-hour of sitting in the 
    black hole of awkwardness that had materialized in my Olds, we pulled up to 
    Angela's house. Will detached himself from Angela's face long enough to say 
    goodnight to me, and when I turned to say something smart and apologetic to 
    Maggie, she was already getting out of the car.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thanks for the ride.&quot; she said.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No . . .&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door slammed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot; . . . problemgodI'manasshole.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I watched Will and Angela walk across the yard 
    up to the door, then, after much groping, through the front door. Maggie skulked 
    in behind them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt like crap. I felt a hangover coming on 
    already. I felt like a loser.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't feel like starting the car.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't remember a lot of happened after that. 
    I guess I zoned out from the alcohol and being tired, and navigated myself 
    home in autopilot. One thing I do remember, though, is throwing my Van Halen 
    tape out the car window as I sped up the on ramp. I wouldn&#8217;t be able 
    to listen to it again without kicking myself. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like to say I woke up. I didn't really. 
    The sun pried itself under my eyelids and forced them open. I was still drunk. 
    My head was swimming, as was whatever I ate last night. To the bathroom.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I puked for about fifteen minutes straight, 
    then collapsed on the linoleum floor. It was cold on my head and I laid there 
    for a while. The sun slowly crawled down the wall and across my chest, where 
    it warmed up my stomach, head, and the tile around me. The floor, no longer 
    cool, was beginning to stick to me. Or was I sticking to it? Linoleum can 
    be tricky that way.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood up, peeled my clothes off like cellophane 
    from a fruit roll-up, and climbed into the shower. I turned the water up as 
    hot as I could stand, and then lay down in the tub.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I woke up again when the water suddenly dropped 
    to arctic temperatures. I sat straight up and shut it off. I stepped out of 
    the shower, toweled myself off, drank from the sink faucet for a while, and 
    then went back to bed.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunday morning, I felt pretty damn good. Well-rested 
    (a little queasy maybe) and ready to go. I pulled on a clean T-shirt and jeans 
    and went into the kitchen. The answering machine blinked stupidly at me. 4 
    messages? Man, I must've really been out of it. I rewound the tape and played 
    it back.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first message was from my mom. She was telling 
    me that she was having a great time in Europe with my step-dad. I put water 
    on the stove for the ramen I dug out of the back of the pantry. I was happy 
    to hear that my mom was having a good time, but I really wanted to hear how 
    pissed off Maggie was. Or wasn't, preferably. Maybe I should get flowers.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next message was from Will. He sounded like 
    death on a stick. Poor bastard. He just wanted to say that, uh, he felt pretty 
    crappy, and he, uh, wasn't going to come over today after all. Sorry. It's 
    okay, man, but shut up already, Maggie's probably waiting to go next.<br>
    The water on the stove was beginning to steam. So was I, actually, when I 
    heard the next message. For the last freakin' time! No one named Serena lives 
    here! Stop calling 'cause I will not pay her goddamn BMG fees!<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took a deep breath. Maggiemaggiemaggiemaggie.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next voice was not Maggie. It was older. 
    Way older. But it was familiar.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hi. I hate these things. Look, I know 
    we're not friends, but, um . . .&quot; the voice struggled for a minute. I 
    still couldn't place it. &quot;Ah, I thought you ought to know . . .&#8221; 
    she sighed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Suziekilledherselflastnight.&quot; 
    My stomach slid into my right foot. It was Suzie's mother. She inhaled sharply. 
    &quot;The, uh, the doctor said . . .&#8221; her voice wavered &#8220;he said 
    that she wasn't in a lot of pain. She swallowed some pills and, um . . . fell 
    asleep.&#8221; She paused. I heard her hand over the phone for a second. &#8220;That's 
    about it. Um . . .&quot; she started bawling openly now. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She 
    left a note . . . she wanted to say . . . to say sorry. To you . . .&quot; 
    she choked the tears back and swallowed. &quot;Right, okay . . . ah, I . . 
    . I'll . . . take care.&quot; *Click* *Beep*<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My vision shook.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned the stove off and leaned against the 
    wall. My ears were buzzing. I slid down to the floor and stared at the machine. 
    Jesus. Crazy people. The world's full of 'em. Crazy people. Nothin' you can 
    do about it. They're just there. Crazy people. Jesus.</p>
