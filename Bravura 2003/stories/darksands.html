<p align="center"> <em>Dark Sands</em></p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was amazing to finally get out of Los Angeles. 
  Tena was tired of living there. She was tired of trying to be someone she wasn&#8217;t. 
  She wasted much of herself on beers rather than school books. Night after night, 
  she would go clubbing with her friends and end up taking a man home. In the 
  morning, it was always the same. She would wake up to find herself hung-over 
  and alone. She was not a bad person and never tried to be. She attended school 
  when she could, but Tena felt she wasn&#8217;t getting anywhere with her life. 
  Up to this point, Tena needed a change. It was her best friend Emi who had always 
  been there for her when she needed someone. Emi was the only family to Tena. 
  And it was Emi who planned a two week vacation to the &#8220;Big Island&#8221; 
  of Hawaii. It seemed like a good idea. Besides Tena could finally relax and 
  find comfort away from home. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women stayed at one of the most exotic hotels 
  on the tropical island. They sat at a window 17 stories up from the ground overlooking 
  the active figures of citizens and tourists below. But Tena couldn&#8217;t keep 
  her eyes off of the enchanting architecture and furnishings of the suite. The 
  curtains reminded her of the black shimmering sands on the island. The sands 
  were her main reason for being here. It was like they called to her and beaconed 
  her to come. She gave a simple sigh as she went to slide open the door to the 
  balcony. Her friend Emi continued to glance out at the darkened world. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Have you ever looked up at the night sky 
  and thought about what those stars really look like?&#8221; Tena began.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;No.&#8221; Emi spoke quietly from the window.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Well you should come out here and take 
  a look at them&#8221; Tena called. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emi gathered herself from the chair and joined 
  her friend outside.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Ever since I was a child, I&#8217;ve looked 
  up there wondering if one day I could see one up close. To really see heaven 
  for what it&#8217;s worth...to know what it feels like to really be in peace&#8230;you 
  know?&#8221; Tena continued as her eyes graced the evening sky.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Yeah, well that&#8217;s always you, Tena, 
  trying to find peace. The only way that you&#8217;ll ever find it, is if you 
  stop doing the things that you do. Ever since I&#8216;ve known you, you&#8217;ve 
  always been accepting your defeat and you need to stop doing that and be optimistic 
  about life,&#8221; Emi replied. &#8220;Besides that are you still having those 
  dreams?&#8221; she continued.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tena silently bowed her head to the question. 
  She had always had the same dreams. She closed her eyes and for a minute flash 
  of it streamed through her mind. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thought of darkened skies and the splash of 
  raging tides made her skin cringe. The feeling nearly made her want to curse 
  the world. It was always the sounds of roaring water and screaming winds that 
  made her sink deeper into herself. The fear of drowning had always scared her. 
  It was a childhood nightmare that would not let her go. She could not shake 
  it. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;It&#8217;s not right to keep this inside, 
  you know. You need to seek some help, that&#8217;s the only way that you&#8217;re 
  gonna get better...&#8221; she heard her friend demand to her, hearing a great 
  concern in her soft voice.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I know, but I told you no matter what happens 
  it still comes back. Every time I go to sleep there it is. Emi, besides you 
  shouldn&#8217;t worry so much. I&#8217;m doing alright. They don&#8217;t come 
  as much as they use to. It&#8217;s like they&#8217;re going away.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But those dreams that Emi asked about made her 
  uneasy. She lied about the dreams fading; they weren&#8217;t fading; they were 
  getting worse. Something was wrong, but she didn&#8217;t know what it was or 
  what made her feel the way she did.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked back in the room. Tena&#8217;s 
  watched displayed 10:30pm; it was time to meet the others in the main lobby. 
  Emi picked up her black satin purse and headed for the door. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terry and Haven were the guys who the two young 
  ladies were meeting. The women had met them shortly after they arrived on the 
  island. Terry with his dirty blond hair was Emi&#8217;s date for the night and 
  Haven was Tena&#8217;s. Haven, who had hair the color of charcoal, smiled eagerly 
  standing a little shorter than his friend Terry. As the two made their way towards 
  the guys at the bar, Tena noticed Haven&#8216;s immediate stare. When they met, 
  Haven smiled at her with an affectionate grin and gently took her hand softly 
  in his.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;You look...breath-taking...&#8221; the 
  young man began. Tena smiled at the compliment.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Are you ready to go on a personal tour 
  of the island?&#8221; he replied in her ear.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gave him a little smirk and thought about 
  what he could possibly be thinking about.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emi replied bluntly as she cleared her throat, 
  &#8220; Well I&#8217;m ready if you are!&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haven simply smiled back at his friend and then 
  to Tena.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Sure...&#8221; she answered back.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men escorted the ladies to a nearby table 
  and sat to be attended. While they waited, Terry broke the awkward silence with 
  a description of the island&#8217;s most spectacular area. Tena watched his 
  eyes gleam, she could almost picture the elegant breezes of the beach and the 
  darkened texture of the black sands. She always wanted to see the legendary 
  black sands of the big island. The timing was perfect for a tropical getaway. 
  She needed a vacation and she needed one badly. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;So how long have you two known each other?&#8221; 
  asked Haven as he glanced at Tena.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Since elementary school...we&#8217;ve always 
  been together...like sisters,&#8221; she replied.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Yea, we&#8217;ve been through a lot. I 
  always manage to save Tena from all kinds of trouble,&#8221; Emi stated with 
  a slight laugh. &#8220;But she&#8217;s my girl and I&#8217;ll always got her 
  back.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;So you guys are basically inseparable, 
  right?&#8221; Haven questioned. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I guess you can say that,&#8221; Tena answered 
  as she playfully winked at Emi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night seemed to roar on as the ladies got 
  to know the guys more. Emi found out that Terry had a phobia of snakes and that 
  if he saw one he would go into shock. Tena found out that Haven was an artist 
  who had much of his greatest work on display at the art gallery downtown. She 
  wondered what else did the handsome young man have in store for her and what 
  did he have to hide under those haunting green eyes. The four had visited the 
  big nightclub down at the Waikenki district, and then decided to take a long 
  drive out to the windy surfs of the beach.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was an unusual night, and the wind had picked 
  up much speed as Terry&#8217;s black SUV stopped in the half empty lot. Tena 
  could see from inside that the trees were swaying heavily to the winds vigorous 
  rhythm. Why are they swaying like that? She questioned herself. Terry, Emi, 
  and Haven were already outside talking when she realized that they were waiting 
  for her to join them. She jumped out a little uneasy then glanced at Emi, who 
  simply smiled and placed her hand on Tena&#8217;s back.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She whispered, &#8220;Its okay Tena, its just 
  a little wind. There&#8217;s nothing to be afraid of.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But somehow, Tena had a bad feeling rising deep 
  from within her. It was something that reminded her surprisingly of her dreams. 
  Haven caressed her neck softly and gave her a comforting smile.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;It&#8217;s okay...you should listen to 
  your friend. It&#8217;s just a little wind. Nothing to worry about. It&#8217;s 
  just the tide. It&#8217;s always a little high on this side of the island at 
  night.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tena let out a little sigh and let Haven take 
  her hand in his as the two followed the other couple out towards the shore. 
  She could see that Emi was having fun talking to Terry. They seemed like a happy 
  pair, the way he would lightly brush away her hair from her eyes. It was a nice 
  sight to see. Tena was glad to see her friend enjoying herself. It made her 
  uneasiness fade a little.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Off to the distance, a bonfire was blazing and 
  its illuminating grace caught the eyes of the boys. They suddenly dashed towards 
  the commotion leaving the girls behind. Emi turned to Tena and gave a slight 
  giggle.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;They&#8217;re a little crazy aren&#8217;t 
  they?&#8221; Emi asked. She stepped closer to her friend and noticed a worried 
  look across her face.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong? I thought you were 
  having fun with Haven? Are you okay? Did he say something to you?&#8221; she 
  asked in concern.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;No, he didn&#8217;t...&#8221; Tena began, 
  &#8220;I just got this weird feeling...that&#8217;s all.&#8221; She slightly 
  smiled. She noticed that Emi&#8217;s eyes were staring at her in disbelief.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Are you sure? I mean if he did something 
  to you, you know that I would be all over him. But if I&#8217;m not mistaken, 
  you&#8217;re the one who said he had a nice butt and that you&#8216;d probably 
  have him by the end of the night&#8221; she joked. &#8220;Do you remember that?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tena smiled and a small laugh escaped her lips. 
  &#8220;Yeah, I remember.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220; Well then c&#8217;mon girl, I don&#8217;t 
  wanna be the only one in this. We are suppose to be having fun, remember? So 
  please be that crazy chick that I know, okay?&#8221; Emi demanded sarcastically 
  as she took off her black stilettos and ran towards the group of kids. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tena smiled at her friend&#8217;s remarks and 
  looked off towards the dark tides crashing onto the black surface of the ocean. 
  There was a moment of hesitation as she slipped off her black platforms and 
  cradled them in her arms. If Emi was having a good time then she should also, 
  but why wasn&#8217;t she? Her discomfort once again plagued her but tonight 
  she intended on having fun and turned to run towards the direction of the bonfire.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she joined the circle of rowdy young adults 
  and under-aged teens, Tena noticed that Emi and Terry were nowhere to be found. 
  She saw Haven gulping down a can of beer with a group of guys. She quickly made 
  her way to them and noticed that the other girls that were in the circle were 
  dancing a little sluggishly and off key to the music. One of them lunged at 
  Tena stumbling over her own feet. Tena shrieked. The girl fell to the ground 
  bringing her down as well. An eerie feeling caught Tena&#8217;s eye when she 
  noticed the girl staring at her. The girl muttered something in her drunken 
  state. The message was too vague for Tena to hear. So she leaned in closer to 
  the girl hoping that she would repeat herself. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;You won&#8217;t wake up from this one...the 
  sands...just the sands, you&#8217;ll see...&#8221; the young girl whispered 
  followed by a disgusting burp. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haven turned and quickly dragged the girl off 
  of Tena. Another rather slim boy pulled Tena to her feet and helped her dust 
  off the dark sand. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Are you okay?&#8221; The boy asked her.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Yea,&#8221; she sighed haunted by the words 
  of the drunken girl. She wondered what it meant. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tena knew that Haven had some drinks at the nightclub 
  and the can of beer he just finished completely intoxicated him . He leaned 
  over and kissed her cheek. His lips were cold and wet and his breath reeked 
  of alcohol. She looked towards Haven and asked him where Emi and Terry were. 
  He responded with a dumbfounded shrug.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;They&#8217;re probably getting to know 
  each other...like we should be doing,&#8221; he said as he whispered into her 
  ear. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his remark a fierce disgusted grin formed on 
  Tena. Normally Tena went home with guys like him. But tonight something seemed 
  a little wrong with Haven. He seemed like a real nice and quiet person when 
  they met at the airport. But now after seeing him drunk and acting like a fool, 
  she re-thought her plan to want to lay him tonight. There was something about 
  him that slightly reminded her of the dreams. He moved his face away from hers. 
  She wasn&#8217;t interested in his invitation anymore, she just wanted to find 
  her friend and go back to the hotel. She had enough of this night. Her eyes 
  searched through the faces of kids who were dancing to the music. Where could 
  Terry and Emi have gone in so little time? Was Terry treating Emi alright? Was 
  Terry acting like Haven? Was Emi having fun? Emi looked like she was having 
  fun but still the possibility of something going wrong lingered with Tena. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without hesitation, Haven softly grabbed Tena&#8217;s 
  hand and led her away from the party. His actions weren&#8217;t forceful, but 
  it did catch her off guard. She wondered where he was taking her as he stopped 
  her at the edge of beach. The sand was damp and lukewarm to her feet. The water 
  wasn&#8217;t cold like it was back in California, but it was nice and soothing 
  and it slightly relaxed her. She wondered to herself why was she still here 
  with him. She should be out searching for Emi. Haven sat down and gently pulled 
  her down to him. His hands were icy cold and his grip on her tightened. For 
  a minute, a flash of her friend entered her mind. It was more the reason to 
  make her want to find Emi immediately. She tried to get up but his grip only 
  tightened more. He then turned to her and gave off a stare of adoration. She 
  saw that his jaded green eyes reflected the darkness of the ocean, looking mysterious 
  but intriguing to her. Then he looked away.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for the way I acted back 
  there,&#8221; he began, &#8220;I don&#8217;t usually act that way, it&#8217;s 
  just that I was getting a little frustrated with the situation.&#8221; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tena narrowed her eyes at him as if trying to 
  understand him.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;What situation?&#8221; she questioned. 
  He turned to her again but this time scooted a little closer.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;The situation between us. I know we just 
  met, but I feel that we have something and we should get to know each other 
  a little more...I know you&#8217;re the type to...I saw how you were looking 
  at me in the club tonight&#8230;giving me those signs&#8230;so let&#8217;s have 
  a little fun.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was now directly so close to her that she could 
  feel his heat. His icy hands were now burning into her and he lustfully licked 
  his lips. Slowly Tena started to feel a shiver rushing up the small of her back. 
  The hairs on her neck began to stand up and the small hairs on her arms stood 
  high with the feeling of goose bumps. At that moment she knew now why Haven 
  looked at her the way he did. She knew that meeting him was a mistake. She should&#8217;ve 
  never decided to go out tonight. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haven stood up and forcefully yanked at Tena&#8217;s 
  arm. She tried to let out a scream but he immediately placed his firm hand over 
  her mouth. He grabbed her from behind and pulled her away from the distant sight 
  of the party. Tena kicked at the sand in hope to juggle herself free of his 
  grip but his strength surpassed her own. Where was Emi; was she in the same 
  situation? Tena thought as she saw the light of the bonfire disappear behind 
  a large sandy hill. Was Terry like Haven? She wanted so bad to get away and 
  find her friend. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dragged her until he came to a secluded area 
  of the beach where no one would see them. Haven sat her down on the beach with 
  his hand still firmly attached to her lips. He pulled out a white handkerchief 
  and placed it gently in her mouth. Her eyes widened with fear as he pushed her 
  down and tugged at her dress. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Now we can be alone.&#8221; He whispered. 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warmth of the salt water enveloped her ears. 
  She could hear nothing but its drizzling bubbles emerging from her nostrils. 
  The salt was burning at her eyes and forcefully rushing down her throat. Her 
  legs trembled as his thrusts hurt her. So many thoughts, not enough time to 
  sort or plan. Where was Emi, where was her hope? She could feel herself losing 
  the firm grip that she placed on his strong arms. Please stop this, you don&#8217;t 
  know what you&#8217;re doing... her thoughts chanted in her mind. But he was 
  too strong for her. She couldn&#8217;t scream because the water had taken control 
  of her vocals. She grew tired. Her mind flashed the remnants of a recent dream. 
  The rushing water, the cringing thought of suffocation, the burning of salt 
  water in her eyes. Like a ghost drifting on the currents of the night, she saw 
  nothing but the sand. Nothing would ever be the same. All her nights of partying 
  and sleeping with endless strangers; it all came back to haunt her. But she 
  wasn&#8217;t going to let her dreams lead the course of her life. With one good 
  kick, Haven&#8217;s grip loosened and she was free. And while he was down she 
  noticed that he had dropped a small blade. She rushed towards it just as Haven 
  regained his balance facing ocean. Before he could turn around, she lunged at 
  him with the blade piercing his back. With a deep shriek, Haven&#8217;s body 
  fell hard into the shore. </p>
<p><br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had been two hours since Emi saw her friend. 
  She began to worry. She and Terry headed back to the beach.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Has anyone seen Haven or Tena!&#8221; Emi 
  called as she walked towards the party scene. Only half of the drunken kids 
  heard her. The ones that did pointed her off into the darkness. Where ever Haven 
  was Tena had to be with him. She quickly walked in that direction in hopes that 
  her concerns were just nonsense. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Tena!&#8221; she shouted as she began to 
  pick up momentum. Behind her she heard Terry call out to Haven. No one answered. 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly heard a deep yell coming from the 
  edge of the beach. A gasp escaped her as she and Terry rushed over a nearby 
  sand dune. The two stood in shock as a shakened and naked Tena stood covering 
  herself. Emi looked to see a body laid face down half way in the currents and 
  half way in the sand. She slowly crept closer to the sight. Terry remained quiet 
  and followed her. It had to be Haven, Emi thought, But why was he covered in 
  Tena&#8217;s dress? Emi turned to question Terry, but he was gone. She then 
  turned to her friend.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Tena? What happened?&#8221; she asked in 
  a shaky voice. Tena quietly walked to her friend and leaned her head on Emi&#8217;s 
  shoulder and began to cry. The black sand covered the nicely shaved legs of 
  Haven only revealing a portion of the black laced dress. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hawaiian police ruled self-defense. Haven 
  had turned out to be a serial killer who enjoyed killing his victims while wearing 
  their clothes. Terry was long gone before the police could find him. Tena never 
  spoke much about that night. She remained real quiet about the whole ordeal. 
  Emi was very comforting to her but still wanted to know what exactly happened. 
  The two had since returned home and back to their lives. Tena took on Emi&#8217;s 
  advice for optimism. She never drunk an ounce of beer or stayed too long at 
  the clubs anymore. Her only focus now was to graduate from the university and 
  start her career. Never again would she take life for granted and feel sorry 
  for herself. All she could think about was the drunk girl at the bonfire that 
  night and what she said: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;You&#8217;re not gonna wake up from this 
  one&#8230;the sands&#8230;just the sands, you&#8217;ll see&#8230;&#8221; those 
  words echoed in her head. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She knew what they meant. For every bad dream 
  that she had, all were connected to that night. She did eventually stop having 
  those dreams but now all she could think of were those haunting events and the 
  black sands&#8230;just like the girl said she would&#8230;</p>
