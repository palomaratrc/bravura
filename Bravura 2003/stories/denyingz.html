    Y- &#8220;I prefer a triangle. For you see, a circle simply goes round and 
    round with neither low nor high points. Life just continues on and on without 
    interruption. With a triangle, there are moments when things must change. 
    Life suddenly takes a sharp definable turn. A triangle allows three such changes.<br>
    X- &#8220;Why only a triangle? A square allows four. A pentagon, five. A hexagon 
    , six. And so on.&#8221; <br>
    Y- &#8220;With any other multi-sided shape you might experience more changes, 
    but with so many angles, life again resembles a circle. A triangle allows 
    but one climax, one moment to savior for its maximum value.&#8221; <br>
    X- &#8220;But with a triangle, do you not again end of up repeating yourself? 
    Just like a circle?&#8221;<br>
    Y- &#8220;It is true that if you do not remain at the top, you may only move 
    back down. And eventually you will arrive back to the same point you started 
    at. But at least there are moments of change along the way. You rise, you 
    fall, things level out, and then you rise again. And if you are enjoying a 
    peak, you may even decide to stay for a while. What&#8217;s the rush to step 
    down when life is high?&#8221; <br>
    X- &#8220;I see. There are certainly advantages to a triangle. I&#8217;m tired 
    of moving in circles. It&#8217;s exhausting.&#8221; <br>
    Y- &#8220;Then let this be a climax and linger around. Stay for as long as 
    you like.&#8221;<br>
    X- &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll stay here for a while.&#8221;</p>
