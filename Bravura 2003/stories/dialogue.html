  <p align="center"><em>Dialogue Story</em></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nibbling on his top lip, Ben gazed 
    at the glow in the dark stars on the ceiling. Georgina looked over at him 
    and chuckled to herself, she knew he was deep inside his thoughts. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Whatcha thinking about?&#8221; she whispered 
    in his ear.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Our future.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;What about it?&#8221; she pursed her 
    lips as she waited for his answer. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben grabbed her hands and closed his eyes. Georgina 
    studied the perfectly centered freckle on his eyelid. Just looking at it spread 
    a warm tingle all the way up her body and finally to her cheeks.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his eyes and locked them on her pupils. 
    &#8220;I see you and me sitting on our front porch, watching our grandchildren 
    play in the grass.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She closed her eyes and let his words wash over 
    her face. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Every morning we walk into town for the 
    newspaper and a fresh cup of coffee. After saying hello to a few of the locals 
    we go home and make love on our hammock.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;It sounds wonderful, so when are you 
    going to ask me?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Ask you what?&#8221; he smirked.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Don&#8217;t play dumb with me Ben Granger, 
    you know exactly what I&#8217;m talking about&#8221; the sharp tone in her 
    voice made Ben smile.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;What are you smiling about? You bring 
    up our future more than I do, yet my finger is still bare. I don&#8217;t want 
    to pressure you or anything but frankly I&#8217;m getting a little anxious.&#8221; 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I will, I promise but you just have to 
    let the moment come. I wanted to ask you the night we met but I didn&#8217;t 
    want to scare you off.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I would have said yes if you had.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben leaned in and kissed her velvety lips. He 
    moved his strong hand towards her face and brushed away invisible hair strands. 
    She could feel his flesh on her face even after he took his hand away. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he opened his eyes, she was biting the 
    corner of her thumb. &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; His forehead crinkled 
    as he looked at her.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid to tell you.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing you can say that 
    could make me leave you.&#8221; His heart started pumping faster and faster, 
    as he spoke the words. He held his breath waiting for the worst. Her silence 
    was killing him. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She kept staring at the wall, pretending to 
    be interested in a painting a friend had given to her. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Georgina&#8230;&#8221; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;m pregnant,&#8221; she blurted 
    out.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben just stared at her, not knowing what to 
    say. His mouth opened and then closed again, and he pushed all the air in 
    his body out of his nose in an agonizing speed. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Say something, anything. Please I need 
    you so bad right now, please.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;m two weeks late. I took the 
    test yesterday. I should have told you, but I wanted to make sure first. What 
    do you think?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Well, &#8230;. I guess I&#8217;m a little 
    shocked, as well as a little excited.&#8221; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Should we keep it?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;What do you think?&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. What about school? 
    I mean, it would be really difficult raising a child while going to school.&#8221; 
    her chin quivered as she talked.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;School is always going to be there and 
    it&#8217;s hard either way. The important question is, do you want to have 
    a baby right now?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;What is that supposed to mean? You don&#8217;t 
    think I&#8217;d be a good mother?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Of course I wasn&#8217;t implying that. 
    I just meant that you are the one who has to carry it, and then give birth. 
    Are your ready to do that?&#8221; he made sure to choose his words carefully 
    so she wouldn&#8217;t get upset.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I need a few days to think about it. 
    To be honest, the thought of being a mother makes my heart stop.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Take as long as you need, I can wait. 
    I love you so much Georgina, and I&#8217;m here for you.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I love you too, Ben.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned off the lights and kissed him goodnight. 
    It took her a while to fall asleep. She rolled from side to side desperately 
    trying to get comfortable. Her head felt heavy tonight, it seemed like the 
    fate of the world rested in her stomach. She tried thinking about school, 
    family, work, anything that would take her mind off of the baby. Finally she 
    fell asleep, but the dream world was unkind to her eyes. She heard a baby 
    crying in the distance and then a chainsaw rumbled and blood was everywhere, 
    she jolted awake and gasped for air. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben sat up. &#8220;What, &#8230;what is it? 
    Are you okay?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Yeah, I just had a nightmare, go back 
    to sleep.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She got up and went to the kitchen for a glass 
    of water. As she stood their, she couldn&#8217;t shake the dream off. She 
    splashed some cold water on her face and went back to bed. </p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning she left for 
    school before Ben had woken. She needed to be away from him so she could think. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if she forgot to feed the baby, or didn&#8217;t 
    play with it enough, or love it enough? Would it hate her for having it? She 
    laughed at herself for thinking that she would forget to feed the baby, but 
    what about the rest of it? <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knew that Ben would raise this baby with 
    her, and he would probably be a great father, but what bothered her more was 
    would she be a good mother?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned on the radio to drown out her thoughts. 
    For the rest of the drive she sang along to whatever came out of the speakers. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School went along smoothly, as 
    if nothing had been said and she was still whole inside. As she drove home, 
    her stomach started knotting again. She hoped that Ben wouldn&#8217;t ask 
    her if she had made a decision because she didn&#8217;t think about it, or 
    at least she tried not to. Walking towards her grey front door, she heard 
    music coming from within. When she entered &#8220;At Last&#8221; was undulating 
    out of the stereo, candles flickered around the room, and a bouquet of wild 
    flowers delicately rested in a vase on the brown rectangular coffee table. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Ben, what is all this&#8221; her voice 
    cracked.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Georgina, is that you?&#8221; he called 
    back from the kitchen. She could hear pots and pans clinking together. Ben 
    came out of the kitchen carrying a glass of white wine. He set the glass down 
    and advanced over to her and took her backpack off her shoulders. He placed 
    it on the floor and then took her hand and led her over to the couch. &#8220;Sit&#8221; 
    he commanded, and walked back into the kitchen.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Georgina&#8217;s shoulders lifted as she took 
    a deep breath, and when she let it all out she felt lighter than when she 
    had walked in. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later Ben came back into the room 
    and sat down next to her. His right arm gently wrapped around her waist and 
    his lips met her curled forehead; unable to hold back any longer Georgina 
    let the tears come. Her body collapsed into his as a deck of cards would in 
    a windstorm. She shook violently but made no sound, not even a lost muffle. 
    Ben&#8217;s masculine grip did not budge the whole time. When she was done, 
    she looked up at him and smiled.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Thanks, I really needed that&#8221; 
    she sniffled.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I know honey. Do you feel better?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;A little bit. So what are you doing in 
    the kitchen?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Oh shit!&#8221; he jumped up and ran 
    out of the room. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Did you forget about something?&#8221; 
    she called after him.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;No, everything is under control. You 
    just relax and dinner will be ready in five minutes.&#8221; His voice was 
    as calm and confident as a spring stream gliding through the forest. He had 
    a knack at putting Georgina at ease with just the sound of his voice.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She picked up her glass of wine and swirled 
    it around using only her wrist, she raised the glass to her lips and took 
    a drink. She could feel it slid down her throat and enter her stomach. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben came back in holding two steaming plates 
    filled with food. A trail of smoke glided into her nose, and as she inhaled 
    her stomach screamed for more. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Wow, you really out did yourself tonight. 
    What&#8217;s the special occasion?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Nothing. I just thought you could use 
    a nice diner. I got us a movie too, you wanna watch it now or after we finish 
    eating?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Let&#8217;s watch it now.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He rose from the couch and put the movie in. 
    She opened her mouth and let a quick breath of air in. She couldn&#8217;t 
    find the words for how she felt at this moment. Her body swelled with love 
    and nothing else mattered. </p>
