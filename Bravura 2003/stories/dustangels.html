<p align="center"> <em>Dust Angels</em></p>
<p align="left"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;When does the reunion start?&#8221; Adam 
  asks, looking at his watch.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Not &#8216;til six,&#8221; Megan says. 
  &#8220;We have time to rest. Besides, I think my grandma said Laura was leaving 
  around five, and I really don&#8217;t want to have to talk to her.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It bothers Adam that Megan calls her mom by her 
  first name. Neither Adam nor Adam&#8217;s siblings call their parents by their 
  first names, and God knows they have reason to. The two lean against Adam&#8217;s 
  car and look out at the vast desert. In the distance, thin funnels of sand turn 
  like small tornados. They&#8217;re called dust devils.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Megan smiles. &#8220;I remember this one time, 
  when I was five. My dad was taking me to visit his parents. We were driving 
  through a desert on his motorcycle. He was too poor to afford a car, and we 
  only had one helmet.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Who wore it?&#8221; Adam asks.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;He did, most of the ride.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;What a jerk,&#8221; Adam says apathetically.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Megan starts. &#8220;I guess. 
  Anyway, we got to a point in the road where this huge dust devil was. I mean, 
  it was HUGE! And it was right in the middle of the road. It seemed like we sat 
  there forever, and it just wouldn&#8217;t go away.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Weird.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Yeah. So anyway, at that point, my dad 
  put his helmet on me, and we drove through it! Can you believe it?&#8221; Her 
  smile is huge now. &#8220;It was so scary!&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Wow,&#8221; Adam says, not sure whether 
  or not he should believe her. &#8220;So it sounds like your dad wasn&#8217;t 
  such a bad guy after all, huh?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she asks. &#8220;He 
  was a total loser.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;But he let you wear his helmet, didn&#8217;t 
  he? He was the one who went into the dust devil unprotected.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The accusing look on Megan&#8217;s face makes 
  Adam wish he hadn&#8217;t said anything.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Look,&#8221; she says, &#8220;you have 
  no idea what kind of a person my father was. You have no idea. He probably put 
  the helmet on me because my mom would&#8217;ve killed him if she found out he 
  didn&#8217;t.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two sit in silence for a moment, and Adam 
  considers dropping the subject. But he finds he just can&#8217;t resist. &#8220;Your 
  mom?&#8221; he says. &#8220;You mean Laura, the workaholic, self-important bitch 
  who doesn&#8217;t care about anyone and never does anything for you?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Just forget it.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;No,&#8221; Adam says. &#8220;You&#8217;re 
  always moping around, all dark and depressed. You&#8217;re always talking about 
  how no one loves you, and how pathetic your life is. Megan, it&#8217;s all bullshit!&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Megan flinches.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He continues, &#8220;I think your parents care 
  about you. At least one of them does. Either your dad put that helmet on you 
  to protect you because he loved you, or the thought of your mom getting pissed 
  off at him forced him to put the helmet on you because she loves you. Or maybe 
  they both love you. You lie so much, I never know when I should believe you.&#8221;<br>
  Megan puts her head in her hands and leans forward. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Did your parents ever beat you?&#8221; 
  Adam demands.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;No,&#8221; Megan says quietly.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Did they ever starve you?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;No,&#8221; she whispers.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Did they ever lock you in the basement 
  at night if you brought home A minus tests? Huh? Did they?&#8221; Adam&#8217;s 
  body shakes and he feels like he might throw up. This is the first time he&#8217;s 
  ever mentioned the abuse to anyone. Now that he&#8217;s started, he can&#8217;t 
  stop. The words flow from him, and with them, the rage and pain. &#8220;Did 
  they ever make you watch while they beat the shit out of your brothers and sisters? 
  No? No, I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Megan sniffs and says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have 
  any brothers or sisters.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adam&#8217;s body shakes with laughter. He starts 
  to put his head in his hands, then he turns around and punches the hood of his 
  car.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Get in the car,&#8221; he says.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Where are we going?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;You&#8217;re going to your grandparents&#8217; 
  house.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;m going to drop you off at your 
  grandparents&#8217;, then I&#8217;m leaving.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Megan gets in the car and slams the door shut. 
  &#8220;You&#8217;re leaving? As in, you&#8217;re leaving my grandparents&#8217; 
  house to go work on your stupid English project? You never spend time with me.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;No,&#8221; Adam says, revving the engine 
  and speeding off. &#8220;I&#8217;m leaving you.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miles pass before either speak again, and finally 
  Megan sobs, &#8220;Why?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adam stares at the empty road ahead. He hates 
  the sound of crying. It brings back painful memories for him. Megan&#8217;s 
  sobs are especially biting, as there is something inside of him that loves her.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Megan,&#8221; he says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t 
  know if you&#8217;ve ever noticed it, but you&#8217;re exactly the way you say 
  your parents are. You&#8217;re completely self-absorbed and immature.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Megan is quiet for a moment. Then she says, &#8220;I 
  think I can change.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She can&#8217;t change. Adam refuses to believe 
  this, though. His traumatizing childhood has made him dependent and clingy. 
  The thought of leaving Megan scares the hell out of him, and he spends the next 
  hour of the car ride feeling the crunch of unpaved road beneath the car, trying 
  to avoid the incessant glare of the bright sun, listening to the occasional 
  gut-wrenching, melodramatic sob from Megan, and thinking about life without 
  her. Finally, he says, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;For what?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;For yelling at you.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;It&#8217;s okay, I guess,&#8221; Megan 
  says. She wipes the tears from her eyes and draws a shaky breath. &#8220;I&#8217;m 
  sorry, too.&#8221; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adam nods. &#8220;Yeah. It&#8217;s okay.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long moments of silence pass. It disturbs them. 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Isn&#8217;t the sky pretty?&#8221; Megan 
  asks.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Yeah,&#8221; Adam says.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I wonder if God is up there, watching 
  us. You know? Like, I wonder if God ever listens to us.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Adam says, 
  that hard look coming back to his eyes. &#8220;Sometimes I get the feeling God 
  is like some malicious writer who takes pleasure in seeing me suffer.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Heh. Yeah, I know what you mean.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adam looks at Megan like she couldn&#8217;t possibly 
  know what he means.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;No,&#8221; Adam says. &#8220;I really 
  do think God is a soulless bastard who gave me life so he could sit back and 
  laugh his ass off at my pain.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Megan laughs at Adam like he couldn&#8217;t possibly 
  be right.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She says, &#8220;I think that if God really is 
  a writer and we&#8217;re just characters is some story of his, then maybe he 
  makes our lives suck so that he teach other deities stuff. You know?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adam laughs. &#8220;Teach them what? Teach them 
  that beating their kids to a bloody pulp is wrong? Are these other deities so 
  morally retarded, they can&#8217;t figure that out on their own?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;No, Megan. God is evil, like Jerry Springer. 
  Our story is meant to entertain, not enlighten. If there are other deities&#8230; 
  or readers&#8230; reading about the horrible things that happen to me, then 
  they&#8217;re just as sick as the writer. Even if they don&#8217;t laugh at 
  my life, they probably read about it because they&#8217;re bored and have nothing 
  better to do. They read about my pathetic life so they can feel better about 
  their own. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;They say writing should teach something, 
  that it should educate. But how many goddamned different versions of &#8220;The 
  Boy Who Cried Wolf&#8221; do people have to read before they finally get it?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Adam-&#8220;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;My point is, writers are encouraged to 
  come up with different ways to teach the exact same morals and lessons that 
  have already been taught over and over and over again. Why can&#8217;t people 
  just read the original story and be happy? I&#8217;ll tell you why. It&#8217;s 
  because people are sick and twisted. They need to see characters being tortured 
  in new, innovative ways. It entertains them to see characters suffer through 
  conflict. Writers throw in the morals and lessons to make readers feel like 
  they&#8217;re not just a bunch of leeches.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adam pulls over to the side of the road, stops 
  the car, and says, &#8220;I hate people.&#8221; He turns to Megan and asks, 
  &#8220;If God is good, why did he create us?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Megan chuckles nervously. &#8220;Adam, what&#8217;s 
  wrong with you?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adam gets out of the car and stumbles toward 
  the barren landscape. He stares out at the desolate, hot land. The dust devils 
  in the distance play with the sand, throwing it high into the air, twisting 
  it, and letting it fall to the sizzling ground.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Adam?&#8221; Megan asks from behind him. 
  &#8220;Adam, are you okay?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Just one sign, God,&#8221; Adam says to 
  the sky. &#8220;Just give me one sign that you aren&#8217;t a heartless jackass 
  and that my life has some sort of purpose.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that very moment, a dust devil confronts Adam 
  and Megan. From this sandy tornado emerges an angel. His massive wings stretch 
  at least thirteen feet across. Bluish black feathers glisten in the sun. They 
  match the angel&#8217;s disturbing black eyes, which contrast with his albino 
  skin and hair.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I have been sent from God, the writer 
  of this story,&#8221; the angel says, &#8220;to enlighten the both you as to 
  the reasons you were created.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;He&#8230; he does exist?&#8221; Adam asks, 
  somehow finding the words to speak despite this miraculous and unexpected plot 
  twist.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;She,&#8221; the angel corrects. &#8220;Yes, 
  she does exist. She would have corrected you earlier, but she could not think 
  of a believable way to bring up the issue of deity gender in your dialogue exchange.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Oh.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;As I was saying, I am here to inform you 
  of the reasons for which you exist.&#8221; The angel turns to Megan and says, 
  &#8220;You exist because God had to write a story for her creative writing class 
  last year. That is when she created you. This story that we are currently playing 
  out is a sequel for you. Kind of.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;What?&#8221; Megan asks. She doesn&#8217;t 
  understand.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The angel sighs. &#8220;You appeared in another 
  story. You more than likely do not even remember, for it took place when you 
  were eight. That was a year and a half ago in God&#8217;s world.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Megan still doesn&#8217;t understand, but it 
  doesn&#8217;t really matter.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;You,&#8221; the angel says to Adam, &#8220;were 
  originally created as a side character for this story. You seem to have come 
  out dominating it, though. God sends her congratulations.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;My mission is complete,&#8221; the angel 
  says. &#8220;I shall now take my leave.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;No!&#8221; Adam cries. &#8220;Wait!&#8221; 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;No. You said you wanted a sign. Just one 
  sign. What more do you want?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Is&#8230; is God a good writer, at least?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;No,&#8221; the angel says. &#8220;She 
  is merely an amateur, and for that you should be eternally grateful. Behold!&#8221; 
  The angel snaps his fingers and yet another dust devil appears. From this tornado 
  drops a very old man with enormous wings.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The horribly aged and abused angel crawls through 
  the sand toward the group. &#8220;Mata me, por favor,&#8221; he croaks.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Ah,&#8221; the angel says with an evil 
  twinkle in his eye, &#8220;I see your writer has finally allowed you to speak.&#8221; 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The very old man with enormous wings pathetically 
  reaches an arm toward the group. The angel snaps his fingers and the very old 
  man with enormous wings is swept up in the dust devil and returned to his natural 
  dimension.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;What was that?&#8221; Megan asks.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;That was the creation of a truly good 
  writer. The character was created so that readers could watch his suffering, 
  thereby quenching their bloodlust.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Really?&#8221; Adam asks. &#8220;I always 
  thought that story was a political statement about-&#8220;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Silence, fool!&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The protagonists watch as the angel beats his 
  wings against the dry air and flies away. &#8220;You are lucky,&#8221; the angel 
  calls to them. &#8220;Most writers are not so generous as to reveal their characters&#8217; 
  purposes to them.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adam and Megan stare at the creature as he flies 
  into a dust devil and disappears. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Megan?&#8221; Adam asks. &#8220;What the 
  hell just happened?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Me neither.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;You wanna go to McDonald&#8217;s?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Yeah.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
