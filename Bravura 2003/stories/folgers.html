<div align="center"><em>A Folger&#8217;s Decaffeinated Coffee&reg; Brown Bag, 
  Rice Cakes, <br>
  or<br>
  Something Much More Important </em></div>
<p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wore a brown paper bag. Not the 
  kind one puts their groceries in or the kind a drunk my wrap his favorite crutch 
  in. This brown paper bag was special. It was constructed meticulously of brown 
  Foldger&#8217;s Decaffeinated Coffee&reg; can wrappers held together with tape, 
  staples, and raw courage. The brown paper bag was like no other that I had worn 
  before. It was my finest creation and unbeknownst to me, it would be my darkest 
  nightmare. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I walked proudly through the streets of San Diego, 
  displaying my handsome outfit to all who would look at me. Women whistled at 
  me, men where envious, birds rested on my shoulders, and every creature on the 
  streets wanted to know who it was that had created such a beautiful outfit.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Nice rice cakes buddy!&#8221; A fair skinned 
  gentleman yelled at me with glee.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I sure do like rice!&#8221; Yelled another.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I merely laughed in modesty and continued on my 
  way. I had no time for such indulgences, for I was on my way to something much 
  more important. So I gave my cheering crowd of admirers a thankful bow and then 
  continued on my way to something much more important. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not long into my travels when the weather 
  began to take a turn for the worse. High above in the sky, darkened ran clouds 
  had wrestled away the last remnants of a cowering sun, and would soon be raining 
  their overfilled bladders down upon me. As I watched the treacherous weather 
  getting ever more frightful, I realized I had forgotten to wear pants. Ordinarily 
  that would not be a problem, but in these days of economic turmoil in the rice 
  cake industry, I knew better than to get caught not wearing pants in a rainstorm. 
  I did have my beautiful creation, my brown bag outfit, but that only went up 
  to my neck. That was a problem. All of my pants went up well past my head, providing 
  invaluable protection from the dangerous and often unpredictable forces of nature. 
  And now I was lying in the middle of a street with little more than a brown 
  bag to protect me. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsure of why I was lying on a street, I immediately 
  jumped up and ran for cover. Screaming bullets of water pounded into my head 
  as I searched in vain for something to hide under. I hid under a tree, but they 
  still found me. I crawled under a nearby car, but they still found me. I used 
  a passing stranger as a human shield, but they still found me. I ran into a 
  tall nearby skyscraper. That really hurt, and the hellish raindrops still found 
  me. I ran down into the world famous San Diego Subway tunnel system, only to 
  realize that such a thing did not exist. And again the rain found its target. 
  It seemed that no matter where I ran, the rain continued to pound into my pantsless 
  head. Such torture, all for the joy and freedom of wearing a brown paper bag.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually the rain did stop. My soaked head began 
  the healing process, the rice cake industry continued to fall, and all returned 
  to normal. But I had no time to relax. Quickly, I began skipping my way down 
  the streets of San Diego once again. Since I had lost a lot of valuable time, 
  I began hopping on just one foot. At this high speed I knew I&#8217;d quickly 
  make it to my destination, or yours, or even to that of the hairless goat traveling 
  next to me. Who would do such a horrible thing to a goat? <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hopped for seconds that seemed like days and 
  quickly found myself deeply out of breath. I had traveled no more than two feet 
  and was completely exhausted somehow. I had forgotten just how heavy a wet paper 
  bag could be. Years of swimming in brown bag outfits through the treacherous 
  waters of Lake San Diego should have taught me. Old Man Winters drowning to 
  death in his sleep, while covered in a montage of brown bags should have been 
  enough. But no, once again my failing memory had put me in jeopardy. Or was 
  it a brown bag?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pondered this as I lay immobile on the street. 
  I rubbed my non-existent goatee, wrinkled an inquisitive brow, and struck all 
  of the fine poses of a thinker. I realized it was true. My brown bag had nearly 
  cost me my life and had contributed to the failing of the rice cake industry 
  for some time now. How could I have been so blind? In a mad burst of energy 
  I jumped up and began ripping my brown bag into hundreds of pieces (857 to be 
  exact). I ripped my bag up until I was stark naked. It was embarrassing, but 
  no more embarrassing than the ridiculous Foldger&#8217;s Decaffeinated Coffee&reg; 
  brown bag outfit I had been wearing only seconds earlier. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the ensuing crowd around me laugh at me? Did 
  they smile at my good qualities and frown at my debatably existing bad ones? 
  Did they attempt to flee in horror through a subway system that did not exist? 
  Was the hairless goat standing next me embarrassed? No to all four, plus one 
  yes. Did they throw rice cakes at me? Yes, yes indeed. A hundred rice cakes 
  flew in my direction. Plain, Butter flavored, Carmel flavored, Cheddar cheese 
  flavored, Ivory Ranch flavored, it didn&#8217;t matter. The rice cakes stuck 
  to my soaked body like glue. What mattered was that my naked bosom was quickly 
  covered by a firm suit o&#8217; rice cakes. I was back now and sporting the 
  highest of fashions. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Nice brown bag buddy!&#8221; A fair-skinned 
  gentleman yelled at me with glee.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I sure do like bags!&#8221; Another yelled. 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I merely laughed in modesty and continued on my 
  way. I had no time for such indulgences, for I was on my way to something much 
  more important. I gave my cheering crowd of admirers a thankful bow and then 
  continued on my way to something much more important.</p>
