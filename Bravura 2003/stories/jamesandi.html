<div align="center"> <em>James and I </em> 
  <p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is a promiscuous event. 
    We know neither whom we shall meet nor the <br>
    contretemps that time will bestow upon us. For each individual, life has its 
    <br>
    different events; those events can be broken into moments, then again <br>
    separated by bleak periods of mandatory procedure. Sometimes a moment <br>
    intended only to be idle or designated for stepping though without any <br>
    regard, becomes the most memorable time of your life; one speck of dust among 
    <br>
    this galaxy of time I keep close to my heart. It was a moment of rebellion, 
    <br>
    discovery, and a hint at what I later would consider the meaning of life. 
    <br>
    James was my childhood simpatico. In retrospect, he gave my vantage on <br>
    life panoramic dimensions. There is a small gleam of hope that I may have 
    <br>
    done somewhat the same for him. Traveling the many terrains of our rural-<br>
    suburbanizing city on foot, we made the best of what there was. With a <br>
    football or tennis ball, a fifteen-minute walk became a trek to make between 
    <br>
    meals. We unmasked the secrets of being and explored the alleyways of <br>
    life. We were best friends bound by no obligations or agreements.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dreary weekday morning of our sixth school 
    year, we met at the usual <br>
    spot to hike the rest of the distance together. It was to be a standard day 
    <br>
    of school; a moment destined for forgetting, like any melancholy occasion. 
    <br>
    We marched side by side like an army of two, unconsciously in step with one 
    <br>
    another. With our combined knowledge of twenty-three years, we spattered on 
    <br>
    about the injustice of our lives and the misunderstanding of our needs. We 
    <br>
    wanted to the summer of fun to last and the days of school to be an <br>
    occasional interruption at our convenience. It was then like an omen that 
    <br>
    our natural engraved path to school turned instead to the wild brush of an 
    <br>
    undeveloped lot. Only three steps into the brush and already we had both <br>
    decided, today there was no such thing as school. Never a word spoken, no 
    <br>
    committee meeting of two for approval of action, it was decided before we 
    <br>
    even knew it was a thought, it was the first time we both ditched school.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aware that two boys at our age wandering the 
    streets of Escondido on a <br>
    school day may draw attention, we needed an inconspicuous path, the <br>
    destination unessential. There was a canal of great proportions made of <br>
    concrete in 1945 to control flooding hazards for the city. It stretched like 
    <br>
    an empty concrete riverbed forking and branching throughout the city. It was 
    <br>
    enormous, but also fortunately for us such a common site that people forgot 
    <br>
    its existence. It was perfect.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day was exhausted on exploring the smaller 
    veins of the concrete <br>
    channel; often donating elements of local inhabitants that must have been 
    off <br>
    fending for their daily existence. Pornographic material, shredded trash <br>
    bags, and other scrap, apparently discarded by some vagrant, became part of 
    <br>
    our stockpile of treasure. We collected a magnitude of things and soon had 
    <br>
    to decide what to leave behind. Eventually we realized that if our loot <br>
    happened to be discovered at home, it would undeniably inaugurate a line of 
    <br>
    questioning that could lead to an undesirable debunk of our adventures.<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The world willingly unfolded it&#8217;s mystery to us as we 
    peeked into the <br>
    shadows of it secrets for more. This was knowledge; a rubric of learning <br>
    that school deprived all, specifically us. Ahead was the train yard but our 
    <br>
    course lay to the right of it. A small bridge for the intermediate flow of 
    <br>
    trains stood with almost a reverence for its duty. For us it was at last a 
    <br>
    challenge.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could feel the rumble of the train on the 
    seemingly solid concrete as <br>
    we stood twenty paces back. It was a simple plan; after this train had past, 
    <br>
    we would run under the bridge and wait for the next train to pass. Whoever 
    <br>
    ran was a coward. Simple. Easy. No Problem. The current train had past <br>
    and we still didn&#8217;t move. We waited. Waited a little longer. We could 
    see <br>
    a train coming. We ran under the bridge and crawled up close to the ceiling 
    <br>
    of it. The ground under us started to rumble. Looking at each other in the 
    <br>
    eyes and reaching a mutual agreement of the circumstance, we decided to run 
    <br>
    and be labeled cowards rather than valiant and dead. James made it out and 
    <br>
    as I went to follow the full wrath of the train passed overhead, inhibiting 
    <br>
    me to move. I was bounced all the way down to the bottom of the bridge on 
    <br>
    the derriere of my jeans, knowing all the while this episode was to end with 
    <br>
    my demise. After what seemed a perpetual nightmare had ended, I lay at the 
    <br>
    foundation of the bridge. Looking down at me the bridge seemed to mock my 
    <br>
    disbelief and smirk at my inability to withstand the same punishment as it 
    <br>
    did time after time. James helped me up and we continued onward like broken 
    <br>
    warriors.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The day had lead us from one side of the city and 
    back again, landing <br>
    finally to a calm, seemly forgotten place at the end of our new found friend, 
    <br>
    our concrete confidant. We opened the brown bags of our mother-packed <br>
    lunches and rummaged though for our favorite items. The food felt deserved, 
    <br>
    therefore satisfying us in a way to be appreciated far more than usual. The 
    <br>
    waters slowly drifted down the final path of concrete into a fury of thicket 
    <br>
    and what may have been a natural creek. The path finished, with the concrete 
    <br>
    ending in man-sized chunks and moss overgrowing the lower areas, we sat as 
    <br>
    the sun started for the horizon and let the silence of the golden dusk say 
    <br>
    goodbye to our adventure.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James and I never talked of that day, nor did 
    we ever venture another <br>
    stroll through the charted regions of our massive friend. We simply let the 
    <br>
    grandeur of that day stay unrivalled by any attempts of duplication. To me, 
    <br>
    James was a friend, always earning every bit of that title. I don&#8217;t 
    know why <br>
    we grew apart or why I remember that day above so many others, however what 
    I <br>
    do know is that there is the occasional need to discover a new path, and <br>
    having friends to share that with makes it a glorious adventure unto itself.</p>
