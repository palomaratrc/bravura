  <p ALIGN="CENTER"><i>Last Summer in Ketcham</i></p>
  <p align="left">For me, the summer of 1959 always begins with the single 
  engine Cessna circling the little airstrip near Uncle Ernie’s home in Ketcham, 
  Idaho. Every other summer, as we approached, a tiny black speck on the green 
  patch of grass near the runway would materialize into one of the hired hands.
  </p>
  <p align="left">Failing to disguise my disappointment, my mother would try to 
  smooth things over by reminding me that Uncle Ernie was very busy writing and 
  would have been here if he could have. But that summer, I saw the speck grow 
  into a familiar big shouldered man wearing a broad brimmed hat. Uncle Ernie.</p>
  <p align="left">For fourteen summers mother and I went to his home on the 
  lake. The trips started the year I was born, the same year my dad died. Mother 
  said it was important that I get to know my father’s only brother. The two 
  brothers walked in each other’s shadow when they were boys, she explained. She 
  told me when I was born, each reveled in the prospect of my new life and 
  planned to include me in their adventures. When a German fighter plane forced 
  my father’s aircraft deep into a snow covered field in 1944 their plans 
  inextricably changed. Staying close to Uncle Ernie was mother’s way of keeping 
  my father alive, but I only got to see him once a year because our home in New 
  York was too far away for more trips and mother’s busy editing job at 
  Scribners didn’t allow for long vacations. I knew the annual trip was coming, 
  so I was content. It was worth the wait. </p>
  <p align="left">Preparations for our summer trip never varied. Right after 
  Christmas, mother would begin to talk about visiting Uncle Ernie. She’d pull 
  out our photo album and we’d reminisce, looking at snap shots of carefree 
  summers past while Manhattan snow flurries unwrapped around our apartment. 
  Mother’s eyes glistened as she studied the dogeared photographs of herself 
  hugging a tall man whose face resembled Uncle Ernie’s. She’d hold me closer 
  and closer as she turned the pages, retelling the events the photos had 
  captured.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Here’s your father and Ernie trying to stand in a canoe,&quot; she 
  laughed aloud.&quot;This one was taken at the end of the pier. Look at the tiny 
  fish they caught!&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">The delicate lines around her eyes would relax and her soft 
  lips turn up in tender smiles as she spoke of my father and Uncle Ernie, his 
  big brother. Her gaze would linger on my father’s grinning face captured by 
  the click of a shutter long ago. She must have missed him and the life they 
  were supposed to live with me. At the time, I never considered our lives would 
  be any different, because mother was devoted to me; afraid of losing the only 
  link she had to my father’s love. Her caresses were constant reminders that 
  still leave vivid impressions: a stroke of my hair, a kiss on my forehead, her 
  hands cupping my face as she spoke softly to me. </p>
  <p align="left">By April I’d start sorting through piles of keepsakes from the 
  year to share with Uncle Ernie anticipating the trip ahead. I looked forward 
  to the way he picked up a school drawing or a math paper with its imperfect 
  score or my newest baseball cards, and then examine them as if each was a rare 
  document. His questions would come at me fast: What were you thinking about 
  when you drew this? How did you come to that conclusion? Why is this player 
  batting last? He’d stare at me the way a hawk watches its quarry, reacting to 
  my answers with a puzzled frown, one raised eyebrow or his index finger 
  stroking his beard. Because my responses were often ideas made up on the spot, 
  he seemed pleased. Uncle Ernie didn’t mind that for a girl, I liked baseball 
  more than dolls, and fishing more than playing dress up. I think he saw a bit 
  of my father in me. He noticed traits I wouldn’t recognize until I was a grown 
  woman missing him and the father he had replaced.</p>
  <p>• </p>
  <p align="left">That summer, after we landed and unfolded ourselves from the 
  Cessna, Uncle Ernie and my mother rode in the cab of his cherry red pickup 
  truck while I shared the open back with the suitcases and his dog, Bigger, a 
  black Labrador retriever who always remembered me with wet kisses. I leaned 
  back against the tailgate, held Bigger to my chest, and let the wind blow New 
  York from my lungs as we bumped up the highway. </p>
  <p align="left">At the end of the dusty driveway that stretched over a mile 
  from the main road, his low slung, wood house settled into a grove of pine 
  trees facing the lake. He’d lived in the rambling warren of mismatched rooms 
  for as long as I could remember. Over the years he had filled it with his 
  books, mementos, wives, and children, all now gone. Big game hunting trophies 
  crowded the walls. The chairs were worn and easy to slip into, like 
  comfortable old shoes, and if sand sifted onto the rugs scattered throughout, 
  no one cared. From the front of the house, a wide green lawn sloped to the 
  lakeshore from which a long pier jutted out on watery legs. It was always the 
  same. Nothing new, nothing changed. A perfect summer about to begin. </p>
  <p align="left">Uncle Ernie nosed the pickup into the barn, scattering the few 
  chickens that lived there, slammed the driver’s door, then lifted me high 
  above his head against the sun. Looking down, my laughing face was reflected 
  in his mirrored sunglasses. I couldn’t see his warm brown eyes, but I knew 
  they were wrinkled up in delight. At fourteen I was small, yet still too heavy 
  for this ritual. The strain showed on his face, but I’m sure my giggles made 
  up for the effort. <b></p>
  <p align="left"></b>As he walked us to the house, his arm around my shoulder 
  felt reassuring, and I remember feeling that nothing could change our time 
  together. </p>
  <p>•</p>
  <p align="left">Routine settled in as it always did. At dawn, he’d poke his 
  head in my room and hurry me to pull on my clothes and meet him at the end of 
  the dock. Mist shrouded the lake, curling around us as we stood like two 
  ghosts flicking our fishing poles. With a slithering ping, our lines sliced 
  through the moist air until the hook with its metallic disk fluttered onto the 
  lake surface. We didn’t talk. Uncle Ernie said voices scared the fish. We just 
  grunted a happy little sound when the lure dropped in a particularly nice 
  spot. As the sun warmed up the July morning, it drew musky scents of crayfish 
  and decaying leaves from the reedy shore and pulled the mists back into the 
  lake revealing our figures: Uncle Ernie, intent on his arcing line, while I 
  hoped my feeble attempts to mimic his perfect casts didn’t fail. </p>
  <p align="left">To fail him would be inexcusable, and I tried hard to live up 
  to his expectations. His presence was larger than anything else in my life. 
  He’d faced bulls in Spain, fought in wars, safaried in Africa, and reaped 
  awards for the stories of his exploits. </p>
  <p align="left">The rest of the day, after the sun began to burn through the 
  back of our shirts and the fish had dropped down into the cool bottom of the 
  lake, Uncle Ernie worked. He wasn’t to be bothered then, my mother told me. 
  But sometimes I’d sneak up to the open door of his office and sit cross-legged 
  on the floor watching him. He’d write standing up to relieve the pain in his 
  back, his head bent and his broad shoulders hunched over the tall desk. </p>
  <p align="left">That summer the work was different. Big hands and meaty 
  fingers that had curled delicately around a fishing rod earlier, now hammered 
  furiously on the keys of his battered Corona Number 4. Eyes fixed on the crisp 
  paper rolled into the typewriter, he was lost in the rat-a-tat-tat of keys 
  hitting paper in furious volleys. The cadence that once sounded melodic to me 
  was now interrupted by the shrill whine of paper ripped from the typewriter. 
  Balled up then thrown accompanied by eruptions of profanity, the crumpled 
  paper rested on book shelves and spilled out of his waste basket. His usually 
  tidy office was strewn with messy stacks of pages bearing red slashes through 
  the words. </p>
  <p align="left">Every so often, he would inhale mightily, sucking in fresh air 
  from the open window facing his desk. He’d fill his lungs as if the thoughts 
  and stories he wrote were drifting in on the cool currents. </p>
  <p align="left">By six o’clock, Uncle Ernie would stop, snap the worn cover 
  atop the Corona, and light a cigar. That was my signal to regain contact. He’d 
  pour an inch or so from a bottle of Havana Club into a squat glass, grab the 
  bottle, then beckon me from the hallway. I’d follow him outside to sit on the 
  porch swing and together we would watch the sunset over the lake. </p>
  <p>• </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Carrie Ann, do you remember your father?&quot; He often asked this 
  question. Sometimes with intensity, sometimes nonchalantly like he didn’t 
  really want to know, but just to remind me that I did have a father once. I 
  glanced at his bearded silhouette, mesmerized by the rings of cigar smoke 
  hanging in the air above his head.</p>
  <p align="left"></p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Not much,&quot; I answered, hoping for new stories about my 
  father.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Brave man. Flew planes over Germany in WWII. Died there.&quot; 
  Walking to the edge of the porch, he peered at the lake, his hand sheltering 
  his eyes from the sun’s rays glinting on its surface. The white shirt that 
  stretched across his broad back glowed in the dwindling light, and the briny 
  scent of his work day hung in the air. He gazed at the horizon, his head 
  slowly moving from side to side. When he turned back to face me his eyes were 
  damp. </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;We both went. I came back, he didn’t. Brave. Yes, he was.&quot; 
  His voice trailed off into the dregs of the Havana Club. </p>
  <p align="left">I’d heard the war story before. &quot;Mother said he killed 
  people,&quot; I said softly.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;He didn’t want to. Had to because he was a soldier. They kill 
  because they have to. Soldiers are brave.&quot; His whispered words took on a 
  hollow dejected tone like when you’ve been disappointed and can’t do anything 
  about it.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;You killed animals. Did you have to do that, too?&quot; I asked, 
  thinking of the mounted heads of elk, big horn sheep and bear scattered 
  throughout the house.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;No, it’s different. I hunted animals for sport. The killing 
  is unimportant. I just did it because...&quot; Uncle Ernie’s face sagged. &quot;Not 
  brave, you know.&quot; He wiped the sleeve of his shirt across his eyes. </p>
  <p align="left">Night had captured the sky in layers of purple and gray. Pale 
  stars were emerging above the watery blue haze hovering on the lake. The 
  screen door creaked behind me and I sat alone watching the darkening Idaho sky 
  come alive. </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Come inside, kiddo.&quot; Yellow lamplight spilled from the 
  doorway framing Uncle Ernie’s big body and glinting through the amber liquid 
  in the glass he held. </p>
  <p align="left">The gleaming row of guns carefully locked inside the tall 
  glass-fronted cabinet by the front door were off limits to me. Their 
  foreboding presence drew me to them anyway. As I passed them, I always stopped 
  to study them. </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;They’re Uncle Ernie’s,&quot; mother reminded me, &quot;No one but him 
  may touch them.&quot; </p>
  <p align="left">He patiently wrote their names down on a scrap of paper when I 
  was ten. I can still recite their names from memory: a 416 blue-black Perugini 
  side-by-side rifle, a glossy 30/06 Ruger with an engraved barrel, a 7mm 
  Weatherby, its carved stock a grainy black and brown, a 405 Remington like the 
  one Teddy Roosevelt used, a 308 Browning with a deer head engraved near the 
  trigger, and a stubby double-barreled Boss shotgun. </p>
  <p align="left">The guns fascinated me, just like the blank glass eyes of the 
  animal heads mounted on the walls and the huge brown bear in a corner standing 
  on its back feet, mouth open in rage. The guns were real. Not like the 
  headless dead animals whose bodies were gone and forgotten.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Carrie Ann, come away from the gun case,&quot; Mother’s soft voice 
  instructed. I looked over my shoulder at her, but I didn’t move. My mother 
  kept a worried eye on me. </p>
  <p align="left">The furrows between her eyebrows deepened and her mouth 
  straightened into a tense line, as they did whenever I revealed a part of me 
  she didn’t understand.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Let her be.&quot; Uncle Ernie had walked into the room.</p>
  <p align="left">His hand rested on my shoulder, and Mother backed away 
  wordless. </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;You see the big one?&quot; He gently pushed me towards the 
  Perugini rifle. &quot;That one is for elephants.&quot; </p>
  <p align="left">The glass felt cool to my fingertips where I timidly touched 
  it above the rifle, then furtively glancing at mother, quickly dropped my hand 
  to my side.</p>
  <p align="left">His knuckles tapped across the glass, stopping at each gun 
  displayed in the lethal row I’d memorized.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Tiger...bear...rhino...gazelle...&quot; his deep voice grew 
  quieter with every word.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Each one has its own purpose. Do you understand?&quot; His wide 
  sweeping gesture took in the walls around us. He stared down at me, eyes 
  narrowed into slits. </p>
  <p align="left">I nodded, but I didn’t understand. Then. </p>
  <p align="left">The Boss shotgun rested in last place in the case. He looked 
  at it for a moment.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I haven’t used that one yet,&quot; he said, pausing.&quot;It’s all 
  you’d need to kill a man.&quot; He glanced at the gun again then turned away, 
  disappearing into the hallway. Within moments, the sound of ice clinked into a 
  glass and the smell of cigar wafted from the recesses of his office as the 
  door closed softly behind him. </p>
  <p>•</p>
  <p align="left"></p>
  <p align="left">The summer weeks unfolded and our routine varied a bit; some 
  days we took a trip into town. Just Uncle Ernie, Bigger and me. Everyone knew 
  us. The postmaster</p>
  <p align="left">would slip Bigger a cookie along with Uncle Ernie’s mail and 
  packages and always, a stick of Black Jack gum for me. We’d stop for a fresh 
  bottle of Havana Club at Willie’s Liquors &amp; Spirits, where Uncle Ernie would 
  pick up an armload of newspapers from far away places, and finally the Piggly 
  Wiggly to fill up our cart from mother’s list. </p>
  <p align="left">We’d made those stops today. </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;What’s in the mail?&quot; Uncle Ernie glanced over at me.</p>
  <p align="left">I had the bulky pile on my lap and was inspecting the 
  intriguing colorful stamps as we drove home. </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Three envelopes from New York, one from Paris, and the 
  package is from Los Angeles.&quot; At the bottom of the pile, I balanced a flat 
  brown paper wrapped box on my knees.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Open the box, and tell me what’s on top.&quot; His eyes were on 
  the road, but the sound in his voice made my fingers hurry as I tore open the 
  wrapping and lifted the lid. A letter lay on top of a thick sheaf of papers.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Read the letter to me.&quot; His voice rasped, a dry tight sound.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Dear Mr. He....&quot; I began to read.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Skip that part, just read the message,&quot; he interrupted. </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;This is your best work, old pal. It looks like you’ve got a 
  winner here. It’s bursting with passion and bold intrigue. One publisher is so 
  eager to read it I’m meeting </p>
  <p align="left">him tomorrow to...&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Passion? By God, ‘passion’! What does that SOB know about 
  passion?&quot; He pounded the dashboard with his fist. &quot;I know what he’s 
  doing...bullshit! He knows the passion’s gone. The book’s no good. By God, he 
  feels sorry for me. Damned SOB!&quot; His big fist hit the dashboard again.</p>
  <p align="left">I jumped as Bigger struggled from my grasp, barking at the 
  sudden sound. </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;But isn’t this good?&quot; I didn’t understand. The letter praised 
  his work.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;No! No. No good. I’ve failed and he knows it. Patronizing son 
  of a bitch.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">The veins on Uncle Ernie’s neck stood out as he gripped the 
  steering wheel tighter.The knuckle bones of his big hands turned yellow-white. 
  His foot pushed the accelerator down to the floor sending the pickup truck 
  lurching along the road. Holding on to Bigger’s collar, I braced my feet 
  against the floorboard and jounced up and down on the seat. Bigger collapsed 
  against me. As the full weight of the big dog pinned me against the door, I 
  grabbed the armrest to keep my balance. The pile of mail slid to the floor.</p>
  <p align="left">Uncle Ernie’s face reddened as his brown eyes grew black and 
  widened. I could taste the dust and exhaust billowing behind the pickup truck 
  as it blew into the open window. </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Stop! Stop!&quot; I shouted, pounding his shoulder with my balled 
  up fists. For the first time in my life I was afraid of him. Afraid of what 
  might happen. It was as if he didn’t remember Bigger and I were there, or even 
  where he was. </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Stop, stop, please stop. I’m afraid!&quot;, I yelled again, 
  glimpsing the blur of trees along side the road as the truck sped faster.</p>
  <p align="left">Then as quickly as his black rage emerged in all its fury, it 
  stopped.</p>
  <p align="left">He eased back on the gas pedal and the truck began to slow as 
  he turned it onto the shoulder of the road in a flurry of crunching gravel, 
  then cut the engine. </p>
  <p align="left">Afraid to move, I sat motionless. A warm trickle of sweat ran 
  down my spine and my gulped breath, coming in short painful bursts, began to 
  subside. </p>
  <p align="left">Running his hands through his hair, he stared blankly through 
  the window, then turned to me, shoulders slumped. His tanned face looked 
  sallow beneath his beard and tears filled his eyes. </p>
  <p align="left">He cupped my chin in his hand and scanned my face taking in my 
  wild blond hair, the freckles on my nose, and my brown wide-set eyes like his. 
  I stared into his drawn face and felt something break between us forever. I 
  couldn't look away.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Ahh, kiddo,&quot; he moaned from deep inside his chest. &quot;I didn’t 
  mean to scare you. Don’t be afraid. Don’t be afraid to fail. Not like me. Be 
  brave like your father.&quot; </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;You haven’t failed.&quot; I searched his face, wanting to say the 
  right thing, to comfort him. </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I have failed. The work isn’t good anymore. I know it. Time 
  to be brave and... I don’t think I can do it.&quot; His deep voice wavered and he 
  looked away. Thinking back, looking at me must have reminded him of a tomorrow 
  he no longer could see. </p>
  <p align="left">&quot;You haven’t failed me,&quot; I mumbled, hoping my loyalty and love 
  would be enough. </p>
  <p align="left">No matter what I said, I believe he knew something inside him 
  was dying.</p>
  <p align="left">His hand dropped from my face as he turned back to stare at 
  the road ahead, the fields and mountains beyond it and to the horizon where an 
  unknown future lay.</p>
  <p align="left">I flung my arms around his neck, burying my face in the 
  softness of his beard. Cars whizzed by. We sat there alone, unaware of time 
  until shadows deepening in the corners of the cab veiled our faces. </p>
  <p align="left">He spoke at last. &quot;Better get home. Your mother will be 
  worried.&quot; </p>
  <p align="left">The string had broken on the sheaf of papers and they laid in 
  disarray on the floorboard. I started to gather them up.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Never mind those, &quot; he said. &quot;They’re nothing to me now.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">We rode home not speaking, the silence broken only by Bigger’s 
  panting.</p>
  <p>•</p>
  <p align="left">Summer was drawing to a close. In Idaho, fall nips at August 
  mornings, urging shoes onto bare feet and sweat shirts over jeans. 
  Reluctantly, I began sorting my collection of curious stones, pressed flowers, 
  and feathers, choosing what to keep and what to leave behind, and thinking 
  about the trip home. Soon it would be time to return to New York. I wondered 
  if summers would ever be the same again.</p>
  <p align="left"></p>
  <p align="left">Uncle Ernie hadn’t worked since the day I’d opened the box 
  from Los Angeles and read the letter to him. He still went to his office after 
  fishing, but now he either read in front of the open window or stared at the 
  landscape. The keys of the Corona remained untouched and Willie’s Liquors &amp; 
  Spirits delivered Havana Club to the house by the case. As the days shortened, 
  Bigger obediently padded after me, his nails clicking on the wood floors 
  echoing through the quiet house, but he sought Uncle Ernie’s companionship 
  more and more. </p>
  <p align="left">The day we left, I looked down at Uncle Ernie’s diminishing 
  shape as the Cessna rose higher into the sky. His beard jutted upwards as he 
  pulled his hat from his head and waved it slowly in the air. In the distance, 
  the sun was setting. Layers of cool purple and gray mist would again settle 
  onto the lake, and if I closed my eyes I could smell Havana Club and the sweet 
  scent of cigar. </p>
  <p align="left">All these years later, I know why I was there that summer. To 
  say goodbye.</font></div>
