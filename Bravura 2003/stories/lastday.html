  <p align="center"><em>Last Day</em></p>
  <p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was time to eat and Sally 
    had not come down for breakfast. Momma missed her presence at the kitchen 
    table, but knew better than to wait. Pappy and Little Brian had to eat. Their 
    day was already clicking by and time couldn&#8217;t be spent waiting on Sally. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I&#8217;ll see what&#8217;s takin&#8217; 
    that girl so long.&#8221; Momma said.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Momma hung a batter-covered apron on her chair 
    at the table and then made her way out of the kitchen. Pappy and Little Brian, 
    already deep into their meal, traded routine glances. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;There she goes again.&#8221; Little Brian 
    said, shaking his head. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;You mind your momma boy.&#8221; Pappy 
    quickly snapped at him. &#8220;Today is the last day anyhow.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;But-&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pappy raised a pointing finger from his plate. 
    Little Brian looked down to his food passively, but did not hold the rest 
    back.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;What if it aint?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pappy did not answer. He only continued eating, 
    letting his eyes wander out of the kitchen, to the stairs.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Momma made a conscious effort to place her forefeet 
    heavily on the stairs&#8217; squeaking spots as she made her way up. She hoped 
    that by the time she arrived at the top, Sally would have heard her and would 
    be waiting for her there. The two of them could then head down for breakfast 
    together. Momma added a loud, purposeful cough as an extra added insurance. 
    Sally couldn&#8217;t mistake her intentions. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the stairs Momma found herself 
    alone. It was a major disappointment. She had plainly made it clear that she 
    was coming. Sally had to be either asleep, or she was intentionally ignoring 
    her. Momma disliked either of those possibilities.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Momma took in frozen moments of her family&#8217;s 
    past as she moved through the hallway which contained doorways to each of 
    the family member&#8217;s rooms. Along its walls were family portraits from 
    when Sally was just a baby, and Little Brian had not yet been born, up to 
    just a few months ago when Sally was about to make the transition to high 
    school, and Little Brian was repeating the third grade. While the children 
    had changed so much from portrait to portrait, little in appearance looked 
    different about Momma and Pappy. Momma was perhaps a little skinnier in the 
    earliest ones, and Pappy&#8217;s hair was not quite as gray, but overall they 
    looked the same. <br>
    Momma peered into the last portrait on the wall as she neared Sally&#8217;s 
    room. The effect was like looking into a mirror, and seeing someone different. 
    She wore the same heavy house dress, though it was now slightly tattered in 
    comparison to the photo. Her hair was no longer brushed out with volume and 
    flowing past her shoulders. It instead curled tightly around the back of her 
    head, ending in a ratty, mangled bun. Momma&#8217;s face in the portrait was 
    painted shiny with make-up and underneath that was a large smile that represented 
    the times. She had not smiled in months. Now she looked different, but had 
    not changed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Come on lazy bones, breakfast is gettin&#8217;cold.&#8221; 
    She said as she knocked on Sally&#8217;s door. There was no immediate reply, 
    no sound whatsoever coming from inside the room. Momma knocked a second time 
    even louder. If Sally was still in bed then she couldn&#8217;t possibly be 
    asleep anymore. She had to know Momma was there at the door, waiting for her 
    to join the family. Unless of course she was sick. Momma quickly opened the 
    door and then sighed at what she saw. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was dark and still. Tossed clothes 
    and other items littered the floor, and Sally&#8217;s small bed was unmade, 
    empty. A quick further inspection of the room showed no signs of Sally&#8217;s 
    presence. Momma then stepped back out of the room and looked to the open doorway 
    of the family bathroom at the other end of the hallway. The lights were out 
    and no one was inside. Momma now began to worry. Before she could ponder all 
    of the implications that were forming, a slight draft called her attention 
    back into Sally&#8217;s room. <br>
    Inside, the flower-patterned curtain of the room&#8217;s single window was 
    lifting upward and swaying, reaching out to the door, to Momma. Momma wanted 
    to ignore the curtain. She could pretend that she didn&#8217;t notice the 
    display it was putting on for her. Perhaps she could begin searching for Sally 
    somewhere else in the house. In another room, maybe downstairs. Sally had 
    always been into playing hiding games when she was younger. Maybe she was 
    doing that once again. Hiding. Playing a game.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Momma knew better. She knew what she had to 
    do. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly Momma walked up to the curtain and drew 
    it aside, thoughts of what she would discover brewing through her head. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;That girl.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window beyond the curtain was wide open, 
    allowing the steady morning breeze to run through the room. Momma wrinkled 
    her brow in frustration. She could no longer deny the fact that Sally was 
    not here. She was not home. She had likely snuck out in the middle of the 
    night to spend time with friends whom Momma considered to be ruffians. Momma 
    knew what a bad influence they were and did not want to allow herself to ponder 
    all of the possibilities. Her Sally was a smart girl and had been raised well, 
    but there was no telling what might happen under pressure. Momma refused to 
    think about it. Instead, she decided that while waiting for Sally to come 
    home she would clean things up a little. It would be a good way to keep her 
    busy and not allow her to think about where her daughter might be. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Momma could not remember when Sally had become 
    such a messy person. Her pink and blue sheets where strewn across the floor, 
    tangled with her clothes, books, music cassettes, and a host of other belongings. 
    Her beauty station was cluttered with makeup; a bottle of bright red fingernail 
    polish lay on its side, its contents spilled out into a dried puddle. Picture 
    frames on top of her dresser were turned downward. Adjacent awards from school 
    and gymnastics were knocked over unto their sides. Everything was covered 
    in a layer of dust, unkept in any reasonable order. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Momma decided it was best to move everything 
    into the center of the room in a semi-organized pile. She could then pluck 
    individual items from out of the pile and put them away in their proper place. 
    It was the most efficient way to get Sally back on the right track. She would 
    come home and find her room organized and clean. It was a start. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Momma closed the door and began. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hours later Momma was crying. It was a sorrow 
    she had never experienced before. She could do little more than sit balled 
    up on the floor, staring at the mountain she had formed in the middle of Sally&#8217;s 
    room. Everything that was Sally was piled up before her. Her daughter was 
    there in the finest details. This was harder than she could have ever imagined. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Momma?&#8221; Little Brian&#8217;s voice 
    called out. Momma was shook with surprise. Little Brian, dirty faced from 
    the morning&#8217;s chores, stood at the doorway with a questioning look on 
    his face. Behind him was Pappy with a hand placed firmly on his shoulder. 
    Momma could not speak. The tears were still rolling down her cheeks. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;You let your momma be son. Go wash yourself 
    up now.&#8221; Pappy told Little Brian.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Yes sir,&#8221; Little Brian said. He 
    did not leave immediately. He instead watched his Momma with fascination as 
    she continued to cry. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Momma looked to Pappy with saddened eyes. Pappy 
    then shooed Little Brian off to the bathroom. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;It&#8217;s time Momma. You said today 
    was the day.&#8221; Pappy said. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words penetrated deep into Momma. She knew 
    it was time. That made it no less painful. She did her best to tell Pappy 
    that she knew, but could not say a word. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;We brought up the boxes for ya. Me an&#8217; 
    Little Brian can bring them downstairs when you&#8217;re done.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Momma looked beyond Pappy. A column of folded 
    cardboard boxes and a role of masking tape were stacked high behind him in 
    the hallway.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I&#8217;ll be out at the barn if you 
    need me.&#8221; Pappy watched Momma for a lingering moment and then left her 
    alone with the boxes and Sally&#8217;s belongings. </p>
  <p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Momma packed away Sally&#8217;s 
    belongings one at a time. She took care with each item, treating every one 
    like a delicate treasure. Everything, no matter how insignificant it might 
    have seemed, was now important. As she wedged in a pair of dusty shoes into 
    one of the boxes, a feeling of relief overcame her. As she wrapped Sally&#8217;s 
    trophies inside one of her bed sheets, and then placed them too into the box, 
    there was happiness. Momma felt it rising through her body. She was crying 
    once again as she gently tucked in Sally&#8217;s first teddy bear. The tears 
    she cried were not from the same sadness that had ruled her for months. They 
    were now tears of joy. Momma was smiling as she moved forward. She continued 
    filling the boxes. </p>
