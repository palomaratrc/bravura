  </p>
  <p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a problem with leprechauns. 
    The problem is serious enough that I am concerned about my life and yours. 
    I think that I may have uncovered a truth that no man, woman, or mime should 
    ever have to witness. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever taken a bite out of a bologna 
    sandwich and discovered that it was not bologna, but in fact tea leaves that 
    the sandwich contained? Of course you have. We all have. Well, that has nothing 
    to do with my leprechaun problem. Or does it? I did not think so the last 
    time I ate a tea leaf sandwich. I soon discovered differently.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, tea is the primary national 
    product of French New Guinea. Whenever one eats tea, they eat a small piece 
    of French New Guinea. French New Guinea tastes real good. A not so well known 
    fact about French New Guinea is that a leprechaun population flourishes there. 
    I discovered this fact accidentally one day when I overheard a conversation 
    between two very loud employees at a McDonald&#8217;s drive-thru window. Through 
    that informative ease-drop, I discovered that French New Guinea was overcrowded 
    by leprechauns. So crowded in fact, that the leprechauns there fill every 
    inch of land from coast-to-coast. That seemed harmless enough. After all, 
    how could it possibly affect me? As long as I was wearing clothes and could 
    continue eating tea leaves every day, I had no concern for French New Guinea's 
    social problems. That lack of concern nearly got me killed. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so long ago, during a Sunday afternoon in 
    Balboa Park, I was happily miming a bologna sandwich when suddenly an angry 
    clan of leprechauns attacked me. They took my money, my toupee, three small 
    chairs, a kite, my libido, my laundry detergent, Katherine Hepburn, and my 
    tea. It took me while to figure out exactly what they had taken from me. It 
    was not until I stood naked at a McDonald&#8217;s drive-thru that I realized 
    that my tea had been stolen. Seven weeks later I was told that my clothes 
    had been taken too. But it was the tea that continued to echo through my mind. 
    That was when it hit me. It was not my clothes that the little elves had been 
    after, it was my tea. That shook me up so hard that on the way home I slipped 
    off of the sidewalk and fell into a nearby ocean. As I drifted away from the 
    coast I looked back just in time to see an angry leprechaun screaming &quot;That 
    tis' what it feels like to be a French New Guinean...arrgghhh!&quot; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An angry leprechaun indeed. My own selfishness 
    had not allowed me to see what eating a simple tea leaf sandwich can do to 
    a midget elf living on French New Guinea. Every bite one takes from a delicious 
    tea leaf is bite of French New Guinea soil. With no more space for the leprechauns 
    who live there, people like me had unwittingly been causing hundreds, perhaps 
    thousands of leprechauns to fall off into the sea and drown. I had been a 
    murderer and not known it.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make up for this terrible oversight, I have 
    recently begun shipping boxes filled with soil and bologna to French New Guinea, 
    in hopes of helping them reclaim their lost beaches. One might think such 
    actions would mean an end to my leprechaun problems. I beg to differ kind 
    reader. I can still feel hidden eyes watching me when I go to the park. I 
    know they are out there and ready to take revenge the next time I let a tea 
    leaf enter my mouth. I have to be careful and you should too. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do yourself a favor and make sure that the next 
    bologna sandwich you eat is not actually a hand full of tea leaves. It can 
    save you from horrors that you can not imagine and it just might save lives.</p>
