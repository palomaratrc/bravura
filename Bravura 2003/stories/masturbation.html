  </p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I d&#8217;know, I just 
    don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m very&#8230;interesting anymore.&#8221; Duane Felice 
    said nervously over the phone, slouched over and hugging his shins on his 
    sofa. It was lime green with spots of brown yarn woven into it, a hand-me-down 
    from his mother. She gave it to him one and a half years ago in commemoration 
    of Duane&#8217;s moving out into his own studio apartment which was not much 
    larger than the house he grew up in. Though he had committed the forthcoming 
    diatribe to memory a thousand times over in his head Duane still spoke nervously. 
    He even tried writing a song about it, which he never got around to finishing.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I know&#8221; Emil Schultz, Duane&#8217;s 
    most frequented companion for the past three years said flatly and atonally. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duane was perturbed. It&#8217;s not that he 
    had been seeking disagreement, as is the case with most people airing out 
    their faults and failings; it&#8217;s just that Duane had intended the pregnant 
    pause to build dramatic tension between the last and the next piece of dialogue. 
    This is why he wanted to cease interacting with people altogether. Duane continued 
    regardless. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I&#8217;ve just been finding it easier 
    and easier to partake in these useless, vapid conversations with intellectual 
    non-descripts, both of which I used to hate so much, and when it comes time 
    to bare my soul and talk about something meaningful with, say an old friend, 
    I just come up short!&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was true. Lately Duane found his conversations 
    with those whom he cherished the most to be riddled with clots of awkward 
    silence and &#8220;so, how ya&#8217; been?&#8221; style pap, whereas conversations 
    with strangers, total strangers would flow flawlessly and effortlessly, though 
    granted the subject matter would be so vacuous that it defies the need for 
    specification.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Uh-huh&#8230;&#8221; the voice on the 
    other end of the line said quickly, barring all need for examples which Duane 
    was certainly ready to give.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;And y&#8217;know all this shit we surround 
    ourselves with? Like all these records, and movies? They used to be my connection 
    to the outside world, like, a common interest to start conversations, or friendships 
    with. Like &#8216;Hey, you&#8217;re into this, or that band?&#8217;, or &#8216;You 
    liked such-and-such movie? Hey, let&#8217;s hang out!&#8217;, y&#8217;know? 
    But now it just seems like all that shit&#8217;s locking me out from everyone. 
    Like, why bother going through the motions of meeting people, and interacting 
    when I can get the same satisfaction from a Nico album, or watching Slapshot 
    for the millionth time?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Hey, that was on TV the other day!&#8221; 
    Interrupted Emil, again throwing the conversation off the ideal course Duane 
    had plotted over and over in his mind. Duane hopped the hefty dose of silence 
    he gave in reply would be punishment enough for Emil&#8217;s impudence.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I guess the thing to say is I&#8217;m 
    just &#8216;growing up&#8217;, or whatever, but that&#8217;s such a fucking 
    cop out. I mean, look at Reggie, or Kim, those cats are goin&#8217; on what? 
    30? And they still act like fucking 17 year olds! Why can&#8217;t I have that, 
    y&#8217;know? I feel like I&#8217;m old enough to be worrying about mortgages, 
    and I&#8217;m not even old enough to go into a bar! Shit, maybe I&#8217;m 
    just depressed. I don&#8217;t feel depressed&#8230;&#8221; Duane was teetering 
    off.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Yeah, I know, I know, I know&#8230;&#8221; 
    Emil said, getting quieter and quieter each repetition. The 15th minute of 
    Velvet Underground&#8217;s &#8216;Sister Ray&#8217; was corroding the daydream. 
    Duane hadn&#8217;t been hunched over with the telephone, pouring his heart 
    out to his dearest friend; rather he had been reclined on the same sofa, his 
    hands interlocked over his chest, starring listlessly at the speakers of his 
    old, but loud stereo. In reality, it had been two days since the tan rotary 
    phone in the kitchen of Duane&#8217;s apartment had seen any use at all. These 
    were the sort of daydreams which had permeated Duane&#8217;s psyche as of 
    late. Common, everyday, daydreams about interacting, not with celebrities, 
    or imaginary people, but with people who he knew well and could be reached 
    over the phone. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evolution of Duane&#8217;s imagination 
    is as follows; as a child, Duane dreamed things of fantasy, of a world as 
    mystical and exciting as any of his videogames, or cartoons (his main companions 
    during this era of development). In his younger adolescence he seemed almost 
    fixated on violently avenging every wrong against himself, and aggrandized 
    his ego to no extent. No cruel gesture directed his way would be spared a 
    savage beating towards the culprit of said gesture, and in his mind, not the 
    greatest of intellects, or meekest of budding sexual interests of his peers 
    could resist the charm that was; Duane Felice. In high-school, and later adolescence, 
    his daydreams were fixed on the accumulation of all things material. Just 
    behind every Herb Albert and the TiaJuana Brass Bands LP in the thrift store 
    album bin doubtlessly lurked a pristine copy of SSD&#8217;s &#8220;The Kids 
    Will Have Their Say&#8221;, or the self financed version of Can&#8217;s &#8220;Monster 
    Movie&#8221; LP, with alternate cover. And now he found himself at the ripe 
    age of twenty, seemingly incapable of mustering up anything better than a 
    regular conversation. Duane was dressed in his work clothes, though he didn&#8217;t 
    have to go in for another hour. &#8216;Sister Ray&#8217; was coming to its 
    conclusion. The song, and &#8220;White Light/White Heat&#8221; had become 
    his anthem for the past few weeks. At first he danced around &#8216;Sister 
    Ray&#8217;, repeatedly playing side A without breaking a sweat, but lacking 
    the endurance to sit down through the full 18 minute dirge without picking 
    up a comic or the phone midway through. Slowly but surely, though, it sunk 
    in. It was something about the dying wheeze of Cale&#8217;s organ. It reminded 
    him of his present attachment to reality. He drew parallels in the seemingly 
    endless sonic abrasiveness of &#8216;Sister Ray&#8217; and the burden of surviving 
    in the modern world. Just like the harshness of the world, he learned to endure. 
    &#8216;The only difference&#8217;, Duane thought to himself, &#8216;Is that 
    I ENJOY listening to &#8216;Sister Ray&#8217;&#8217;. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song&#8217;s end came just where Duane suspected, 
    culminating in the subtle click of the turntable&#8217;s arm up against its 
    perch, followed by the inevitable implosive burst of silence that follows 
    every album&#8217;s end. Duane sighed. He got up, sulked languidly over to 
    his record crates, but his arms on his hips, and looked down, as if to say 
    &#8220;Speak to me, one of you, please! Lord knows no one else will&#8230;&#8221; 
    He gave in, and placed the stylus at the beginning of side B again. 30 seconds 
    into &#8216;I Heard Her Call My Name&#8217;, he gave up, removed the arm from 
    the dizzy record. He decided he would go to work early. Again. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duane walked down the main streets of the town 
    in which he had lived for the past 12 years. The blue sky was cloudless and 
    oppressive, crushing down on the trees, apartments and suburban shopping centers. 
    The weather was nothing but perfect, which made matters worse. Duane hated 
    being miserable in such perfect conditions. It made him feel guilty. Everything 
    made Duane Felice feel guilty.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked mindlessly and effortlessly along 
    the same path he walked five days of the week. The constant drone of cars 
    speeding past him made an effect of a spastic rhythm. Duane didn&#8217;t own 
    a car, though he harbored no particular animosity towards them. Duane found 
    himself at a dead indifference towards the whole affair of transportation. 
    This indifference was slowly becoming his opinion towards many things in life, 
    and lately, it seemed, towards life itself. At the opposing end of love, you 
    will not find hate, nor at the opposing end of happiness will you find sadness. 
    The opposite of any emotion, Duane had postulated as of late, is indifference. 
    That same indifference was becoming Duane&#8217;s mode of life.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People would pass Duane on the streets. Non 
    descript people, some in couples, some with kids, some walking the opposite 
    way of Duane, others coming from behind at a steadier pace than his own. Each 
    of these people&#8217;s non-specific details made Duane more aware of each 
    of his own. Duane was a 20 year old white, heterosexual male. High-school 
    graduate, virgin, moderate drinker, though lately a teetotaler, non-voter, 
    presently dressed in a pair of black store brand low-top Velcro sneakers, 
    white socks, black slacks, a white button up shirt and a black apron with 
    a nametag rolled up and tucked into his back pocket. Short, dirty, light brown 
    hair, parted to the left. WT: 150 LBS, HT: 5&#8217;9&#8221;, EYES:HZL. One 
    long scar up his inside left calf, the result of a fire pit accident when 
    he was 11, which he begrudgingly was obliged to explain anytime he would go 
    swimming. Annual income; approx. $14,000. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These 
    were the facts. These were the things that mattered.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duane had somewhere to go, somewhere he would 
    end up at where he was supposed to be. He didn&#8217;t have to think about 
    how to get there, and he wouldn&#8217;t have to think when he got there. It 
    was all patterns, repetition, and routine. It all took as much effort as his 
    heart took to pump the blood through his veins.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the haze that inevitably enshrouds the 
    mind when the body unconsciously adjusts to the contours of The Routine, Robert 
    Sanguine, an old friend of Duane&#8217;s whom he hadn&#8217;t seen since they 
    went record shopping all day two Sundays ago, rambunctiously surprised Duane 
    from behind, grabbing him by his shoulders and shaking him a few times, yelling 
    something undecipherable.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;What&#8217;s up, dude?&#8221; Robert 
    said, with his trademark combination smile/smirk.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Not much. Goin&#8217; to work&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Yeah, I figured either that or turning 
    into a Mormon&#8221; Robert said while giving a little tug to Duane&#8217;s 
    collar.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comment caused the muscles in Duane&#8217;s 
    left cheek to tighten, pulling up the left corner of his lips. It was a smile. 
    &#8220;No shit, all I need&#8217;s a bike, huh? How was that Screamers boot 
    you picked up?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Same shit that&#8217;s on the LP, just 
    unlistenable. Haven&#8217;t heard from you in a while, whatchya been up to?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Oh&#8221; Duane&#8217;s lack of expression 
    returned to his face, forced to be reminded of the lack of events that transpired 
    the past few weeks. &#8220;Oh, nothin&#8217;. Work, n&#8217; shit. Lotsa&#8217; 
    &#8220;White Light/White Heat&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;That&#8217;s a killer record.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duane liked Robert. He was younger, more optimistic. 
    Duane sometimes felt bad for not being as nice to Robert as he could be, only 
    because Robert seemed to really like Duane, for reasons Duane couldn&#8217;t 
    figure out. Overall, though, Robert had good taste, in music and in life. 
    Duane always thought that was a person&#8217;s only important responsibility.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pregnant pause was in its third trimester. 
    &#8220;Hey, I ran into Reggie the other day,&#8221; aborted Robert &#8220;Man, 
    what a fuckin&#8217; character!&#8221; Duane wasn&#8217;t listening at all, 
    and hoped Robert would notice and spare him the completion of a jovial anecdote 
    when Duane clearly wasn&#8217;t in the mood.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I&#8217;ve been fucking miserable lately, 
    Robert. I never leave the house &#8216;cept for to go to work. I never call 
    anyone, &#8216;cause I know I&#8217;m such a fucking drag that no one wants 
    to be around me, but people must feel sorry for me and they just won&#8217;t 
    tell me. My whole fuckin&#8217; life revolves around records, and I know it. 
    That&#8217;s all anyone talks with me about, and for good reason. I&#8217;m 
    so fucking self-absorbed nowadays. I guess I always have been, but it used 
    to contribute towards me being interesting. Now it&#8217;s just sad.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Yeah, you seem kinda&#8230;I dunno, down 
    lately&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I&#8217;m past down. Down is &#8216;fuck, 
    I had a shitty day at work&#8217;, or &#8216;they fucked up my order at the 
    taco shop&#8217;, and you&#8217;re pissed off, then you get over it. Me, what&#8217;s 
    my fuckin&#8217; excuse? I mean look around you, look at this weather! It&#8217;s 
    fuckin&#8217; beautiful! Who could be depressed on a day like this? I&#8217;m 
    an asshole!&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;You&#8217;re right. You are an asshole.&#8221; 
    Was the last thing the imaginary Robert Sanguine said inside Duane&#8217;s 
    mind as he walked through the automatic sliding glass doors of the grocery 
    store, Jobe&#8217;s, where he was employed. Duane no longer felt it necessary 
    to amuse himself with the conversation of the daydream that was Robert Sanguine 
    this afternoon. Though he was early, Duane still wanted to keep up his &#8220;Poker 
    Face&#8221; as he deemed his professional emotionless demeanor at the workplace. 
    Who knows what might slip through while he was deeply engaged in an imaginary 
    conversation with a friend of his. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Hi Duane, you&#8217;re early!&#8221; 
    Duane&#8217;s manager, Dori Heizman said enthusiastically in her usual presumed 
    fake cheery voice.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Yeah, I figured you could use me, if 
    not I&#8217;ll just hang out &#8216;til it&#8217;s time to clock in&#8221;. 
    &#8220;Use me&#8221;, &#8220;hang out&#8221;, &#8220;clock in&#8221;. Duane 
    resented having to use phrases like that, but for the past three years, these 
    were the sort of necessary evils Duane needed to employ in order to assimilate 
    himself with his coworkers whom he was certain he held nothing whatsoever 
    in common with.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Great, check with Jake, maybe he does 
    need you!&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Okay, see you later!&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pain. Endless pain it brought Duane interacting 
    with these people. The whole time Duane was wearing a dead empty smile. Same 
    one he wore any time he had to talk to someone at work.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duane worked in produce. He got to clock in 
    early so a coworker of his who hasn&#8217;t been feeling well could go home. 
    She thanked him. The day was going by smoothly. He helped two elderly women 
    pick ripe cantaloupes, sampled a mango to a man with thinning hair, who in 
    turn decided to buy the whole mango, and into his sixth hour of labor, he 
    was engaging in a dissertation with an apparent Martian on the practices of 
    consumerist Earthmen, while stocking tomatoes.<br>
    vThen something happened. Duane caught the eyesight of his friend Emil Schmidt. 
    His heart began to beat faster, his shoulders tensed up, and goose-bumps crept 
    over the exposed parts of his forearms. This was unexpected. This was, oddly 
    enough, really happening. Emil was coming closer.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Hey&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Hey&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Whatchya doin&#8217;?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Goin&#8217; shopping with my ma. What&#8217;s 
    up, whatchya been up to?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Pfft, this&#8221; Duane shrugged and 
    motioned to the growing pyramid of crimson produce. A smile crept over his 
    face. He couldn&#8217;t help it. He was happy to see a friend.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emil sarcastically nodded &#8220;Lookin&#8217; 
    good&#8230;&#8221; Duane could see Emil was wearing the same smile. &#8220;Any 
    new records?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Not since I got that last batch of stuff 
    from Sounds. How &#8216;bout you?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Nothin&#8217;. &#8216;Might be gettin&#8217; 
    a grip of Mystic shit from some kid over the internet&#8230;Like, the first 
    Mentors 12&#8221;&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Woah, that&#8217;d be awesome. The cover&#8217;s 
    gnarly on that record&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;You missed a cool show last week&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Yeah, I heard about that. I had to work.&#8221; 
    Duane lied. He knew about the show. He wasn&#8217;t working. It was just easier 
    for Duane to say that rather than explain that for some reason he was lately 
    more inclined to be by himself, and stew in his own depression rather than 
    face the world on a voluntary level. He didn&#8217;t like lying to his friends, 
    especially Emil, but he truly felt, much like his on-the-job persona, that 
    it was a necessary evil.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Sucks. When ya&#8217; get off tonight?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;&#8217;Round ten&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;We should hang out. I&#8217;ve been so 
    fuckin&#8217; bored. I think I need to go back to school, or something&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Um&#8221;, Duane stammered. He hoped 
    it wouldn&#8217;t give away the impending lie. &#8220;I told my ma I&#8217;d 
    go over to her place. We&#8217;re supposed to have diner, or something&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Oh&#8230;Cool.&#8221; Emil looked over 
    his shoulder at his mother and her adopted shopping cart. She waved to Duane, 
    and he waved back. &#8220;I gotta go. Take it easy. Give me a ring.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Yeah, later. Good luck with the Mentors&#8221;. 
    They were both still smiling whien they parted. Duane felt relieved. Duane 
    felt guilty. Duane&#8217;s consciousness was overwhelmed with the opening 
    chords of &#8216;Sister Ray&#8217; as he continued stocking tomatoes, slowly 
    falling back into the unbearable indifference that governed his every breathing 
    moment. END</p>
