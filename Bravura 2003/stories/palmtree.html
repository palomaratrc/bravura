  <p align="center"><em>Mechanical Palm Tree</em></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smog induced red gashes ripple 
    across an ominously darkening gray sky. Through the haze, you see a vision, 
    a peerless structural beauty, towering over its counterparts. You lust after 
    this titan, and instinctively crawl towards the visage of omega organic perfection 
    whose fingertips tickle the borders of the ethereal plane. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You fall to your knees at the feet of this lumbering 
    behemoth, hands outstretched, surely, just to touch such a godly specimen 
    of agriculture would bring about a spiritual catharsis which enlightenment 
    itself would be tantamount. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all your human impudence you touch this being, 
    and in all your human fear you recoil. This is not the earth rooted natural 
    Adonis you had suspected. Its bark can be husked to make no parchment, and 
    its meat will fuel no fire bright. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your senses have been betrayed. The oil of shame 
    and guilt drips heavily into the waters of rage. Truly this is the product 
    of the spectacle of man, and not the beauty of nature. But has it not fulfilled 
    your expectations? Have you not reached new spiritual plateaus? What lesson 
    has your betrayal by this demonic pillar taught you? It speaks to you as you 
    press your palms against its cold metallic exterior. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It declares this:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;There is no honor in being human. Surely 
    the worst amongst the myriad of repulsive traits your species possesses is 
    its seeming inability to acknowledge its own inherent repulsion. Your leaders 
    wage wars, MURDER, in cold blood, and call it justice. Your cultures create 
    superfluous waste which you can&#8217;t even stand to live amongst. You call 
    your crudest obscenities entertainment and your finest art obscene.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of striving for spiritual elevation you induce 
    chemical ignorance. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Perhaps the day will come when you will learn 
    to accept your atrocities as part of your nature, then, and only then, in 
    my long dead optimism, might I ever foresee your race overcoming its need 
    to commit such atrocities. Until then, though, let me stand as a tribute to 
    the sinful complacency of the species. As I stand erect, I am both tombstone 
    and eulogy to the planet Earth.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; You are confronted with complete ambivalence towards this Mechanical 
    Palm Tree. The hate you feel proud in feeling, for surely this metallic structure 
    disguised as an earthborn palm tree represents the zenith of human ugliness, 
    yet the love you feel in spite of yourself. The love stems from the comfort 
    and complacency that rests in the gut of all your species. This Mechanical 
    Palm Tree, despite the hideousness it represents is a relaxing thing to look 
    at, calming, and soothing to your heart, as opposed to the eyesore an actual 
    utilitarian metallic structure stripped of its aesthetic pleasantness would 
    surely be. The hate may make you feel unique, but the subconscious feelings 
    of comfort, despite your greatest efforts to deny them, and despite their 
    base nature, holds you in league with the rest of your species. You then understand 
    that there is only one level which humanity can ever hope to reach understanding 
    on: THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR. <br>
