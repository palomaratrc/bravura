<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#8217;ve brought seven glow-in-the-dark 
  stars along with us, keeping them neatly wedged in the pages of my book. I read 
  in a magazine article that seven is a very spiritual number. That it means perfection. 
  So I&#8217;ve taped them up on the walls and ceilings of the places we&#8217;ve 
  stayed, all the motel rooms we&#8217;ve lived in, close to all the things we&#8217;ve 
  done. Because we&#8217;ve been everywhere and done just about everything, Danny 
  and I, and everywhere doesn&#8217;t come with a guarantee of perfection. As 
  long as I bring my own . . . we should be fine. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This room where we are right now has a picture 
  of Jesus above the bed. He is on a hill and raising his arms lazily towards 
  the sky. His eyes are droopy and his face weak. I want to tell him to stand 
  straight and eat something. Nothing about that picture seemed spiritual so I&#8217;ve 
  put my seven stars around it. They are stuck to Jesus now, making his face glow 
  in the dark as they do. He is much more easy to look at with his face all glowed 
  up in the light of my seven spiritual glow-in-the-dark stars. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look over at Danny now. His face isn&#8217;t 
  glowing much. Just enough so that I know it&#8217;s because of the moonlight. 
  He doesn&#8217;t look very spiritual either, but that just might be me . . . 
  I don&#8217;t think that I love him enough to be going nowhere with him. My 
  eyes are beginning to hurt. I&#8217;ll look at Danny once more to see if my 
  vision is cleared, to see if he is glowing now . . . . Maybe I should stick 
  a few stars on him . . . </em><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rubs her eyes and stands from the motel chair. 
  Danny is laying on the motel bed, left arm drooping over the edge and right 
  hand resting on his rising and falling chest. Rise. Fall. Rise . . . fall. She 
  sighs, looks up at her seven stars and takes two steps to reach him. One step: 
  over a magazine, next step: over Danny&#8217;s jeans. She curls her body next 
  to Danny&#8217;s. He positions his body to mold to hers and encircles her waist 
  with his right arm. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sighs. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their chests rise and fall out of rhythm. She 
  closes her eyes and sighs again, catching his rhythm and making it her own. 
  She opens her eyes and stares at the black of the small TV set. She can see 
  their reflection and the reflection of her stars. Danny cups her breast with 
  his hand, and takes a deep breath at her neck. He smiles against her skin and 
  she turns her body to face his. He trails his fingers over the curve of her 
  hip and she thinks his face is glowing now. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bites her lip and then her fingernails. Her 
  knees are bouncing up and down as she flips her hair and picks up her pencil 
  in the dark:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Writing like a mad woman in this dark room, 
  the white of the paper is beginning to hurt my eyes. This room smells of piss, 
  dust and forgotten hope. It&#8217;s suffocating. Could go outside . . . with 
  the rain and that old man smoking his pipe, but there is something itching at 
  my eyes, so I can&#8217;t see where to go. I still can&#8217;t breathe in the 
  room, it still smells like piss, dust and forgotten . . .<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danny went to get dinner. He&#8217;ll come back 
  with a pack of cheap beer. Yes, that is how it will happen. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&#8217;ll come walking up to that truck that 
  we&#8217;ve taken this far, with his right hand stuffed deep into his jean pocket, 
  his left hand loosely holding onto the beer. He&#8217;ll probably notice the 
  old man sitting outside of the next room. He&#8217;ll talk to him because he 
  is like that. He&#8217;s nice. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man won&#8217;t really want to talk to 
  him though, because people at places like these (places where no one lives), 
  just don&#8217;t talk to young, good-looking guys at one minute past the horrifically 
  bright beginning of the day. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will eventually realize this and sigh as he 
  leans on his foot, covered snugly in his cowboy boots, and taps on this room 
  door. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#8217;ll still be here. On the inside. Waiting.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, being as pissed off as I am, I won&#8217;t 
  answer immediately. I&#8217;ll make him wait, because that will teach him. It&#8217;ll 
  teach him that when he took me away, he should have realized that I&#8217;d 
  want to go somewhere, not just to empty motels, with empty jobs in empty diners. 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should have realized that I didn&#8217;t bring 
  enough tape to keep sticking up my stars . . . . <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after a few minutes of his tapping, and of 
  my inner reassurance, I&#8217;ll begin to get thirsty, and make this an excuse 
  to open the door of this motel room and let him in. I won&#8217;t really be 
  thirsty. No, (there is actually a bottle of cheap wine in my suitcase. Some 
  wine I&#8217;d forgotten about until just now). So, I&#8217;ll open the door 
  and stare into his eyes . . . and then he&#8217;ll smile and know just what 
  I am thinking. He&#8217;ll kiss me the way he kissed me the first time, and 
  he&#8217;ll drop the damn beer and carry me into the room, kicking the door 
  shut behind our entangled bodies. There will be fire and sweet mutterings into 
  each other&#8217;s ears. He&#8217;ll breathe into my neck and I&#8217;ll like 
  the way my seven stars look on the popcorn ceiling. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then after that, I won&#8217;t have to keep reassuring 
  the adolescent voice inside of me, that this is what I have always dreamt of. 
  </em><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stares up at the blue of the TV set, watches 
  the images flash before her, bites her lip, and then squeezes out a tear: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Letterman isn&#8217;t doing his job. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have never wanted to cry as much as I do right 
  now, in this motel room in . . . San No Where and Never Going to be Somewhere. 
  The images of New York, are laughing at me. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuckling. 
  You silly fool, it grins, what&#8217;d you think? This boy was gonna take you 
  somewhere? You&#8217;ll have to take this nowhere . . . .<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wipe the salt from my eyes and paint them on my 
  cheeks as I look down at my feet. My small weak feet. Couldn&#8217;t take me 
  anywhere but this here, and this now, and with this man. I&#8217;ll curl these 
  pathetic feet up and under the covers . . . Damn feet, damn small pinky toe, 
  damn chipped nail polish holding me further back the more I study it. All I 
  have now is this damn stupid journal with damn well worn pages, holding my damn 
  stars. Damn. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Letterman said something funny. I&#8217;ll force 
  a smile. Maybe if I force it long enough, it&#8217;ll be true. Forcing, forcing, 
  forcing&#8212;</em><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a tap on the door. She throws her book 
  down and leaps to the door. She throws her arms around Danny&#8217;s neck. He 
  walks into the room with her dangling on him like she was a prize. He kisses 
  her cheek and lowers his head, bringing her to the ground, then opens a beer. 
  She does too. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don&#8217;t say anything. Not one thing. 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gulps at her beer and watches the glowing 
  TV for a few minutes before turning her head slowly towards Danny. He is holding 
  the beer between his thighs and staring at the TV, his mouth is slightly agape 
  and he is beginning to snore.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&#8217;re asleep, she tells him. Then she 
  sets her beer on the floor and peels her jeans off, and stands in front of him, 
  wearing just her white cotton panties and his black Led Zeppelin tee shirt. 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello? She calls out to him in a whimper. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only the echo of the room. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She crawls into the motel bed and wraps the blankets 
  around her body. She knows that she&#8217;ll have to make her body warm because 
  Danny will soon tire of his nodding head and wake enough to crawl into the bed 
  with his clothes still on, and grab for her warm body in the night. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danny is in the motel bathroom now. She is sitting 
  on the motel bed, Indian style, and staring at the bathroom door. Her seven 
  stars are taped on the door in a lazy, crooked circle. She blinks twice at these 
  stars before grabbing for her book, and stretching her body to grab her worn 
  pencil. She flips to an empty page, doesn&#8217;t matter where, and quickly 
  moves the pencil across the clean paper. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;Danny woke in the middle of the night. He 
  had an urge to say sorry. He woke me to say sorry. He sat on this motel bed, 
  pulled me up with him and held my hands as he apologized. He said he was sorry 
  he had taken me this far, without taking me anywhere. He told me that he had 
  never meant to get side tracked, that he really did mean to take me to New York. 
  He really did mean to . . . . <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&#8217;t know he was side tracked. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet there he was . . . holding my hands, and saying 
  he was. He was saying how sorry he was. He was so sorry. And then, I suppose 
  as a reaction to my silence, he wept. He wept. He was grasping my hands and 
  weeping. I reached for him then, and held him. I rubbed his back and kissed 
  his neck, whispering that it was okay. It was alright. That we&#8217;d only 
  been on the road for a year. That wasn&#8217;t so long . . . really. It was 
  fine. Just fine. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told him that. And he kissed my cheek and smoothed 
  my single tear over his fresh kiss. As if to seal his kiss there. To seal this 
  night right there, on my cheek. Forever. This night, when I told him that what 
  he was doing was fine. Fine. Then, after he sealed this night onto me, he sprang 
  for the bathroom to collect himself. . . because he was still weeping. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, as I write in this book, I want to let 
  it be known . . . now it is I who am sorry. I let the chance go. It&#8217;s 
  gone now . . . just gone. I told him that everything was fine. Perhaps I am 
  not that sorry though. I do not feel a need to weep. I do not feel a need to 
  clear this up with Danny. Right now . . . I think I am just trying to feel. 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I touch that sealed promise now, and wonder how 
  strong motel soap can get. </em><br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is sitting on the hood of Danny&#8217;s truck, 
  picking the body parts of bugs off the windshield. She studies them each as 
  she holds the pieces between her fingers, then she sticks her tongue out in 
  disgust as she flicks the pieces away from her. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danny is inside of the small market at this gas 
  station, buying nonsense items such as pretzels and gummy worms. She looks over 
  to see him through the glass window of the market. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&#8217;s 
  studying a bag of chips. Her attention is drawn to a car that has just pulled 
  up to the pump on the other side of Danny&#8217;s truck. A man hops out of the 
  car and smiles at her. She squints her eyes and turns to watch Danny walking 
  towards the truck, with a small bag. Danny tosses her the bag and winks. She 
  looks back at the bugs on the windshield. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the windshield she can see the magazine 
  she was just reading. She bites her lip and looks back at Danny. He is starting 
  to pump gas, as is the other man. She slowly slides off the hood and crawls 
  into the truck through the opened passenger window. She picks up the new magazine 
  and flips through its glossy pages. She raises her feet out the passenger window 
  and studies a page in the magazine, then looks away from it. She looks at her 
  book now. She pulls her knees up to her chin and presses her dry lips on her 
  bare knees. Then she sets her magazine beside her and twirls the abused pencil 
  in her fingers:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> I think I was reading one of the Bront&euml; 
  sisters when I fell in love with Danny. I saw a Heathcliff, believing there 
  was a dark, intelligent, deeply brooding man in Danny. Because, well, in a certain 
  light, Danny could look like just that. When I first saw Danny, there was a 
  warm, soothing light playing in the background (by way of some Christmas lights 
  hung up for the party we were at), so with this image in my head, I believed 
  that I had no control of it. It was all him. All him. He came up to me at some 
  party in some dirt backyard, and that was it. He just walked up, leaned against 
  a thick eucalyptus tree and smiled at me. Three minutes, twenty-one steps and 
  two smiles later, I was letting him fool with my breasts and kiss my neck while 
  I leaned against his truck. To see this in writing, it seems I must be a sleaze, 
  a slut, a floozy girl. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, maybe just a weak woman. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#8217;ll agree with that. I&#8217;ll agree because 
  I like the burn of a crisp tan in the middle of July, so long as my boyfriend 
  licks his finger, presses it on my tough skin and makes a sizzling hiss from 
  his teeth and tongue. I also like reading about my relationship in the latest 
  issue of Cosmo, so long as I can tell my girlfriends how they can save their 
  relationship, as I go home to a man who knows about as much about me as he knows 
  about the seven moons that circle Jupiter. I even like watching my dreams on 
  a big screen, next to this man, giggling stupidly afterwards about how much 
  of a silly chick flick it was. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to wonder if I am only accepting of these 
  facts in absence of my perfection. This morning, as I packed to leave the nowhere 
  where we were, and head to the anywhere we are mapped to go to . . . I counted 
  my seven stars. But, I found only six. Six of my seven stars. One was missing. 
  Six. I counted them six times. Six. <br>
  Danny called me with the honk from this truck and I wedged my six stars into 
  this book. I didn&#8217;t really even try to find the seventh. Now, looking 
  back on it, I suppose I was just too damn tired from counting them so many times 
  . . . . <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, here I am now . . . reading an &#8216;Is He 
  Ignoring You?&#8217; article in the latest Cosmo, with my feet sticking out 
  of the passenger side window in Danny&#8217;s truck, so as to tan away the imprint 
  of my socks. I&#8217;m sure that it is only by putting myself outside of this 
  truck that I could see my tanning, reading and ignoring my life away with this 
  man, as he fills the tank so we can continue our voyage to the greatly covered 
  territory of nowhere. But this seat is so comfortable, so familiar and I&#8217;m 
  almost completely sure of what it&#8217;ll give to me<br>
  So I&#8217;ll continue to scribble away my nonsense, if only this pencil had 
  some lead left. All that is left of it is a shallow, shell of wood. I bite on 
  the tip of it and reach the little bits of lead that it has left to offer me. 
  I look at Danny in the side mirror, between my white feet with chipped polish. 
  He&#8217;s talking to a guy on the other side of the island. They&#8217;ve both 
  got this easy body language that comes from a man who has it all, as they nod 
  their heads and hold a hand to their hips, and laugh about something. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Push my sunglasses up further on my nose and turn 
  my attention to the woman in the other man&#8217;s car. She too is reading a 
  magazine, her feet sticking out of the window. She brings her long manicured 
  fingers to a Styrofoam cup with a straw standing perky and willing from a plastic 
  lid. She bites on this straw and begins to suck the drink from it. She sets 
  the cup back on the dashboard and turns the page of the magazine. She then extends 
  her manicured fingers to grasp a pen from somewhere. She makes notes on the 
  margin of the magazine. She&#8217;s taking notes. She&#8217;s trying to learn 
  from her magazine. Amazing. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch her man get into their car, and she smiles 
  sweetly at him, folding the magazine away. She reaches for the cup again and 
  bites on the straw before she sucks from it. He turns on his Johnny Cash and 
  she smiles and leans over to him. She&#8217;s whispering something to him. He 
  nods and kisses her cheek tenderly. Then he turns the station. Dolly Parton 
  sings out from the speakers. The woman smiles and he tenses in his seat as they 
  drive away--</em><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatchya reading, Pearl babe? Danny asks her as 
  he hops into the truck. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She jumps a little and then smiles. Nothing, she 
  tells him as she tucks away her book, filled with thoughts and her magazine, 
  full of empty margins. He turns the key and Neil Young blares from the speakers. 
  He lowers it and gives her a side smile, asking if she minds listening to this 
  one song. She bites her dry lip and then nibbles on her fingernails. Neil Young&#8217;s 
  voice gives her a headache, but as she looks at her bitten off fingernails, 
  she smiles. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course we can listen to it, she says. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danny smiles, and as he drives them away from 
  this nowhere, she reaches to turn the volume up. </p>
