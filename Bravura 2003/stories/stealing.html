  <p align="center">How To Steal: A Maniphesto</p>
  <p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few things I hate more 
    than seeing injustices. And I don't just mean big injustices, like the Holocausts 
    and all of that stuff going on in the Middle East right now. I also mean all 
    of the injustices that people see as little that are actually just as evil. 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like music stores, for example. See, in America, 
    stores and businesses are run on the idea that more money is better. And maybe 
    more money IS better, but not if you have to rip people off to get that money. 
    What these stores do is charge as much as possible for their products, and 
    try hard to put all of the other stores out of business, and advertise all 
    over the place. But perhaps the biggest crime they commit is brainwashing 
    people into a) actually LIKING the garbage that they sell, and b) thinking 
    that they don&#8217;t have a choice. Most people actually think that if a 
    store charges 18 bucks for a record, then you&#8217;ve got no choice but to 
    pay the 18 bucks. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you do have a choice.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You probably think I&#8217;m going to tell you 
    that you can shop at some independent store that charges less, or that you 
    can find the records for free on the internet and get them that way. But the 
    thing is, a) you can&#8217;t download music anymore because the crooked record 
    stores I&#8217;m talking about shut down all of the easy ways to get it, and 
    b) you shouldn&#8217;t shop at indy stores because the guys who work there 
    are dicks. What I&#8217;m saying is this - the guys who run these big music 
    businesses are so set on ripping people off, right? The only way to solve 
    that problem is to reverse it. And for you to rip them off.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most people have a problem with this, as it 
    is sort of stealing, and there&#8217;s kind of a dilemma that a lot of people 
    have with dishonesty. A lot of people I&#8217;ve talked to about it say that 
    stealing from a music store is like stealing from the musician himself. And 
    the musician is just an honest guy trying to provide entertainment, and he 
    doesn&#8217;t deserve to get ripped off, and blah blah blah bullshit bullshit. 
    The way I see it, though, is like this: every time you ever watch a Mtv show 
    on a band or singer, it&#8217;s always about how much the company rips them 
    off. So if anything, musicians should encourage people to rip off these companies, 
    in retaliation for all the bull they&#8217;ve had to deal with. These businesses 
    steal from the people who make the music, from the people who buy the music 
    - and unless someone does something about it, nothing&#8217;s going to change.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#8217;re probably wondering if I&#8217;ve 
    done a lot of ripping off. And the answer is yeah, of course - I&#8217;m like 
    to stand up for what is right. And you probably wonder also how I get away 
    with it. Which is why I&#8217;m now going to give you a little walkthrough 
    of my basic method. You can consider it a sort of lesson - this is what you 
    should do:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Dress in a button shirt, black pants, and 
    a tie. This will effectively make you look like someone who is not planning 
    on doing anything illegal. And if you can&#8217;t tie the tie, don&#8217;t 
    worry about it - just drape it around the neck. It will just look like you 
    had a tough day at work and had to take the tie off. But make sure that the 
    pants you wear are also BIG, because you&#8217;re going to have to hide some 
    CDs in them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Walk into the store. Right when you walk 
    in, there are two detector thingies on either side of you - but you don&#8217;t 
    really have to worry about those until you&#8217;re about to leave. There 
    will also be a guy at the front, usually some fat dude with a bad combover. 
    Regardless of how stupid he looks, though - you have to make sure you say 
    &#8220;hi&#8221; to this guy. Like this: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Hi!&#8221; 
    It helps also if you ask him a question, like this:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Where do you guys keep your jazz vinyls?&#8221; 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Um... they&#8217;re over there, against 
    the back wall.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Thank you! You have been very helpful! 
    I&#8217;ll let you know if I have any further questions!&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is important for a couple reasons: a) because 
    if you look friendly they&#8217;re not going to keep an eye out on you, and 
    b) if you pretend you&#8217;re into pussy shit like jazz then they&#8217;ll 
    think you&#8217;re a not the kind of guy to rip CDs off. It helps if you read 
    some jazz stuff on the internet, so that you can bullshit your way through 
    a conversation. For example:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Oh, yeah - do you guys have that vinyl 
    &#8216;A Kind Of Blues&#8217; by Miles David?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Ummm... Miles Davis, you mean? Yes, I 
    believe so...&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;That is a great album! It started the 
    modal jazz movement, and it has John CoalTrains on it. Where might I locate 
    this album? (it helps if you talk like a wuss, too)&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Er... it would be right over there, in 
    the jazz vinyl section, near the back wall.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Thank you, good sir!&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, now the guy thinks you&#8217;re all right. 
    To him, you&#8217;re just a sharp-dressed guy who&#8217;s really into jazz, 
    and prefers jazz vinyls to jazz CDs - he doesn&#8217;t see you as the anarchist 
    political renegade you really are.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) After your talk with the cashier, you walk 
    directly back to the jazz vinyls section, walking right past all of the good 
    stuff that they keep up front. While you might want to go for the heavy shit 
    like Blink right away, you&#8217;ve got to first spend some time in the back 
    so that they know you&#8217;re into jazz. THEN you can swing by the front 
    and grab some punk rawk CDs. And later, you can take them back to the jazz 
    section, and remove the little tags and stuff that they put on the CDs to 
    keep you from walking out of the store with them. But for now, you&#8217;ve 
    got to kill time in the jazz section, and look as nonsuspicious as possible. 
    It helps if you look through the jazz vinyls or CDs - and if you see a particulary 
    valuabled CD box or something (like something by Lewie McArmstrong that they&#8217;re 
    selling for sixty bucks), you should rip that off, too. Even though you&#8217;re 
    not going to listen to it, you can still sell it to another CD store later 
    on, and make a little money. But of course, that&#8217;s not as important 
    a reason for doing it as the fact that taking valuable stuff like this is 
    very inconvenient for corrupt companies like this one.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Make conversations with other customers. 
    If you look friendly, then the cashier won&#8217;t think that you have anything 
    to hide. And if you try to help the other customers out - well, then the cashier 
    should be kissing your ass, because you&#8217;re doing his job for him! Use 
    the jazz knowledge you studied beforehand to help, like so:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Hey, that Herby Hang Cock vinyl you&#8217;re 
    looking at is extremely good.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Is it? I&#8217;m thinking of buyiing 
    it as a gift for my nephew. He&#8217;s crazy for jazz.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a golden opportunity, as the guy is 
    clueless and you clearly know more about jazz than he does. If you can show 
    how much more you know then him, then you&#8217;ll look even more helpful:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Yes! I also recommend artists like Lewie 
    McArmstrong and David Bluebeck - the latter of which (pussy talk again!) has 
    an album called &#8216;Take Six&#8217; which is one of the greatest jazz things 
    ever!&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Uhrmmmm.... Isn&#8217;t that &#8216;Take 
    Five&#8217;?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;No, no, no, no, no. That was the American 
    title. On the original British version, they called it &#8216;Take Six,&#8217; 
    in reference to the fact that there were six songs on the album, but on the 
    American version they took one off because some people protested some of the 
    words. So they had to change the title.&#8221; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;O-kay. Thanks for your, uh, help. I think 
    I&#8217;m good with this Hancock album for now, though....&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Sir - it was my pleasure!&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the clueless dude with the pussy jazz-loving 
    nephew now thinks you&#8217;re a big help. And he&#8217;s off to the register, 
    where he&#8217;ll probably say something like &#8220;Gosh, that guy was helpful! 
    Maybe you guys should hire HIM!&#8221; Which is going to help convince the 
    cashier even moreso that you&#8217;re a trustworthy young individual, and 
    are nothing to watch out for. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) After you browse through the jazz stuff for 
    about 10 minutes, you should look up over the rack to see where the cashier 
    is looking. Um... if he&#8217;s looking in your direction, you should just 
    keep on browsing a little longer, and then check again. Okay, now, if he&#8217;s 
    still looking at you, nod your head like this, like you&#8217;re saying &#8220;hey&#8221; 
    to someone you know, but you&#8217;re not actually saying anything and you 
    don&#8217;t actually know the guy. Continue looking around, and check again, 
    like this. Well, if the asshole is still looking at you the third time you 
    check, then you should just grab a vinyl and walk up to the front counter, 
    and engage in another conversation with the guy, to let him know you&#8217;re 
    still just a guy into jazz vinyls, like this:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Hello, sir! How much are you charging 
    for this George and Irie Jershwin vinyl?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Um... I&#8217;m not sure. Let me hold 
    onto it for you and I&#8217;ll ask the manager.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Thank you good sir! I hope it is at a 
    good price, as I have seen very few other vinyls to my liking this evening!&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Really. Is that so? .......&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Unfortunately, yes. Oh, also - a few 
    of my less cultured friends are insisting that I attempt to listen to horribly 
    noisy punk music, despite the fact that I do not enjoy it at all. Would you 
    please tell me where your section of punk is, as it is not a musical style 
    that I am familiar with, and therefore I do not know where the section is?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Well, the punk section is right behind 
    you, but....&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Thank you sir!&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that you&#8217;ve given yourself a reason 
    to go into the punk section, you can... well, go into the punk section. Give 
    the cashier another nod for helping you - and also, it helps if you gesture 
    to the sign that says &#8220;punk rock&#8221; and roll your eyes, to make 
    it very clear that you don&#8217;t like this kind of music at all.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f) The punk section is the easiest part - just 
    pick out five to seven CDs that you want. Some Blink, some Turd Twister.... 
    Oh, and defenitely some Butt Pirates. If you can find some old school stuff 
    like the Sex Pissedholes, then grab that - it&#8217;s pretty good, too. Don&#8217;t 
    put them down your pants yet, though - walk with the CDs back to the jazz 
    section. If the fatass at the cash register asks if you need any help, just 
    turn around and politely tell him: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;No thank you. I was just hoping to look 
    at these horrible punk CDs in the comfort of my beloved jazz vinyls area.&#8221; 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then turn around again and keep walking back 
    there. When you get there, get behind a shelf or something and start taking 
    the magnetic stickers off of the punk CDs. Um... you may notice that some 
    music stores keep their CDs in large plastic things, which make them harder 
    to steal, because you have to get the plastic things off to get the CDs out 
    of the store without the alarm going off. But that&#8217;s okay, because the 
    plastic things are pretty easy to get off with just your hands. Okay, now, 
    of course, some record stores use big plastic things that aren&#8217;t so 
    easy to get off with just your hands, in which case you should always have 
    a pocketknife to try and cut the plastic off. And OK, if that doesn&#8217;t 
    work, you should try hitting the CD against a shelf, too, because sometimes 
    that will knock the CD out of the case, and you&#8217;ll be able to...<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may notice sometimes that the fat cashier 
    will come up behind you when you are doing this. The important thing you do 
    at this point is not panic, and simply talk to the guy in the same polite 
    tone you used earlier, like this:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Good afternoon, sir!&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;What the hell are you doing?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Oh. The security tag on this Ass Dumplings 
    compact disc is obscuring the list of songs, and I would like to find out 
    if &#8216;Crack of Doom&#8217; (one of the horrid songs my friend recommended 
    to me) might be on this particular compact disc.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;You don&#8217;t say.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Also, sir, did you happen to ask the 
    manager about the pricings on those vinyls I asked you about earlier.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Actually, I am the manager. And I&#8217;m 
    going to have to ask you to come into my office.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Why, sir? Surely the price on a vinyl 
    cannot be so hard-finding and... elusive that it can only be found in your 
    office?&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Sheesh... Look kid, I thought it was 
    pretty strange when you first came in here with that video camera there, narrating 
    everything you did. But when I heard you mention stealing - I was onto you 
    right away. Not only have I watched everything you&#8217;ve done, but I&#8217;ve 
    heard you narrate it very loudly. Now, I&#8217;ve seen my share of shoplifters, 
    but you... you&#8217;re obviously pretty damn incompetent.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Sir, I can assure you, I was merely making 
    a student documenary film on what one would do if they WERE to steal some 
    compact discs. I was merely hypothesizing what someone who lacked moral willpower 
    would do in such a situation, and...&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Enough already! I&#8217;m not buying 
    it. Sorry, but I&#8217;m going to have to escort you into the back.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the fatass, balding, disgusting, 
    lying manager-pretending-to-be-a-cashier will grab your collar and lead you 
    into the door in back, the one that says &#8220;employees only,&#8221; and 
    try to remove any of your belongings, like your video camera. Don&#8217;t 
    let him, though - the truth needs to be recorded, so that it can be out there! 
    He&#8217;ll be pretty pissed, and he might even threaten to hit you, but if 
    you make it very clear that he can be sued for physical violence then he&#8217;ll 
    just throw you against the wall and yell at you. He&#8217;ll probably either 
    a) call the police and have you spend the night in jail, or b) just call your 
    mom and dad and tell them to come pick you up. And he&#8217;ll be a big dick 
    about it the whole time, because guys who run places like this thrive on ripping 
    people off, and can&#8217;t stand to see honest, righteous people making a 
    stand against the powers that be. They resist the toppling of the machines 
    of industries at the hands of the wizened few - and wish to plung the world 
    into the darkest depths of suffering and madness and overcharging. But the 
    day will come, when they will see...<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, asshole! Give me back my camera!</p>
