<p align="center"><em>Supermarket</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the sensation of walking into an American 
  supermarket. First the door. Always. This all-too translucent portal only alludes 
  to what lies inside. You take for granted the doorman, the looming red sensory 
  eye, the modern day gargoyle. All it requires to grant your access to this cesspool 
  of consumption is the ability to MOVE within its sphere of comprehension. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your personal artistic tastes or educational background 
  means nothing to The Doorman, the keeper of this bountiful realm of edible commodities. 
  To It, all matter has but one prerequisite, the ability to MOVE. If only humanity 
  could execute such precise prejudice, but I digress.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concrete turns to tile. You feel an implosive 
  burst of conditioned artificial air clashing with the corrupted external air. 
  The impurity of the sun&#8217;s illumination is quickly washed away by ethereally 
  nauseous fluorescent lighting. All the feelings that come with a false sense 
  of necessity are there too. Guilt, disdain, comfort, familiarity, but never 
  satisfaction, and always the gut feeling that LIFE IS MEANT TO BE MORE THAN 
  THIS. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#8217;re being watched. You know it. The blobs 
  of flesh with fashion senses of couches, the uniformed and well groomed clerks, 
  the scowling eyes of god that are the closed circuit television camera. The 
  truth is, these things do little more than gawk at the spectacle of life passing 
  them by, and only the later has an excuse, as electronics don&#8217;t have the 
  capacity to supercede their programming yet. However, man, man gawks. There 
  is no excuse for this, and in the end THE GAWKERS WILL PAY. The gawkers will 
  pay, but that is no concern of ours.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not just eyes that are watching you. 
  The carts, all in line, they&#8217;re poised, waiting for you to vilify their 
  IMMOBILE existence. The water fountain is a tired thing, a martyr, really. It 
  suffers in thankless perpetual servitude, a sign of the company&#8217;s gratitude 
  and consideration of their customers comfort and convenience. Quite possibly 
  the water fountain is the only level headed member of the organization. It has 
  about as much interest in humanity as Prometheus had in bird watching. You know 
  full well where all your favorite products are located, but you wander regardless, 
  in search, perchance, of something MORE. You revisit old friends as you walk 
  down the endless expanses that are the isles. The anti-nutritional cereal you 
  were weaned on as a child, the cola you saw that pop-culture icon enjoying so 
  much the last time you and your friends were watching television, all the cans 
  that were lined up so nicely on the shelves on your last visit, they&#8217;re 
  all here, still. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swirling kaleidoscope of the packages&#8217; 
  colors puts your mind in a next to intoxicated state. Sometimes you can just 
  walk down the corridors and look up at the ceiling and wonder why it&#8217;s 
  so high. It makes you feel so small, and that&#8217;s just how the designer 
  intended, thus accomplishing everything a good religion does. The products are 
  desperate to be sold, some more than others, with their movie-tie-in display 
  shelves, and self-degrading sale prices. Some are so lowly that like armed assailants 
  they study their prey and arrange themselves in positions which will catch their 
  victims off guard. You may have remembered to pick up your bread, but you forgot 
  the circuses, which is why the glamour magazines, candy bars and crossword puzzles 
  all await your eminent departure through the checkout lanes.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what of the checkout lanes? Where else will you 
  see the repression of the human spirit more gauntly displayed? Masses of people 
  waiting, just waiting, to give the clerk their money for the items they hold 
  in their hands. What keeps these people from just WALKING OUT THE DOOR with 
  their desired finds? I see nothing but fear, and complacency. The funny thing 
  is, though everyone in line can&#8217;t stand waiting around, no one tries to 
  initiate conversation. There&#8217;s no socialization in checkout lines, even 
  though THEY&#8217;RE ALL IN IT TOGETHER. It&#8217;s as if everyone&#8217;s so 
  ashamed of themselves they&#8217;re afraid of talking with each other because 
  they&#8217;ll see how empty they are themselves! Oh, what a spectacle. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things of great elegance and beauty, be they designed 
  by man or nature, will stand in their prominence with or without man&#8217;s 
  observations. Things of great utility, such as stoplights, cement, or air; they 
  too exist autonomous from man. Both sects of existence live by one axiom in 
  regards to mankind: THEY NEED US,WE DON&#8217;T NEED THEM. Their collective 
  beauty stands regardless of speculation. Consumer goods, on the other hand hold 
  no such luxury. They must crawl, pine, self degrade, ANYTHING to achieve the 
  attention of mass amounts of humans. This is why Americans love buying disposable 
  goods so much; the two have so much in common.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grocery shopping plays an integral role in every 
  American&#8217;s life. Think about that: All the cheapness, fear, distrust, 
  guilt, and degradation playing such a prominent and necessary role in all our 
  lives. Perhaps we need it, as in, we must truly ENJOY being punished in this 
  nature. Mankind is more in tune with our sins than we give ourselves credit 
  for, and we repent in very subconscious manors, such as shopping. Guilt is our 
  religion. The grocery store is our church. We are all sinners. </p>
