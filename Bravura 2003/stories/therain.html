<p align="center"><em>The Rain</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rain falls, soaks, inebriates; it pounds away all 
  that is left, all that remains. What remains are the feelings that persist, 
  the feelings that can only be stripped away from one by an outside source. What 
  that source is, only one can decide. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To some people, rain brings life. To others, it brings 
  death. It was raining that day.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people came to offer their condolensces and ask 
  if there was anything, anything at all that they could do. At the reception 
  they hung around the buffet tables, feeding their faces and making comments 
  like &#8216;we&#8217;ll miss her so much&#8217;, and &#8216;she was a dear lady, 
  a beautiful soul.&#8217; Then they went back for more shrimp. I stood in the 
  corner of the living room, just watching and listening to them. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people we called friends would come and pat my 
  head once in a while; they would say they knew how sad and frightening it could 
  be for a twelve-year-old. They said they knew.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My older sister locked herself in her room and cried 
  the whole time. Although she was sixteen, she didn&#8217;t understand that tears 
  don&#8217;t bring back what&#8217;s lost.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dad tried to smile. He forced a laugh here and there 
  to make the guests believe he was okay. I knew he wasn&#8217;t okay. I knew 
  he needed all those people thrown out of his house, far away so he could run 
  his fingers through his thick, dark brown hair and realize where he was and 
  what wasn&#8217;t there. I knew him. He needed to get out. However, he screamed 
  on the inside versus the outside; he held it in, and broke himself for it.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Days passed slowly and the meals slowly dwindled to 
  a dinner once a week; the last dinner was left on the lonely doorstep, cold 
  and forgotten. It was okay; I didn&#8217;t like pasta anyway. Of course, Dad&#8217;s 
  dinners were much worse; I often had stomach-aches after a regular meal of burnt 
  chicken and stale french fries. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My sister cried every night. She&#8217;d be bawling 
  her eyes out on her bunk below me while I&#8217;d stick my fingers in my ears 
  and make futile attempts to sleep. What&#8217;s worse, Dad would put on their 
  favorite song. I could hear his feet scuffling across the floor as he danced 
  with himself. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; School came the next month. Our lives were again filled 
  with textbooks and the smell of chalk. For some reason my friends didn&#8217;t 
  like me anymore. They would shuffle their feet and make any excuse they could 
  think of to get away from me. I was forced to spend my time alone, reading under 
  my favorite oak tree in the playground whose thick branches blocked out the 
  sun. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christmas came. Dad tried his best to cook us a Christmas 
  dinner but after three unsuccessful attempts to cook the stupid bird we ended 
  up having three Grand Slams at the Denny&#8217;s down on Baley Street. It was 
  a refreshing change from stomach-aches. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner we came home and sat down before a scantily 
  decorated tree with a few presents under it. As my sister gently opened a small 
  package, I hastily tore off the wrapping from a swiss army pocketknife and held 
  it up to examine. My sister then lifted the lid from the box she had begun to 
  open and revealed a bottle of perfume labeled &#8216;vanilla musk&#8217;. After 
  gazing down at it for a few minutes she started sobbing uncontrollably and slammed 
  into Dad&#8217;s huge arms, and together they cried. Meanwhile, I went outside 
  and retrieved a small twig from the naked trees outside so I could whittle it 
  to pieces with my new pocketknife. I whittled so much that a pile of wood chips 
  was created in front of me after fifteen minutes.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the holidays we trudged off to school again, 
  this time in pouring rain. I liked the rain. I liked how the water dripped from 
  my hair to my nose to my shoes. I liked how it stung my cheeks, poisoning them 
  a furious red. I liked the sound of it, the &#8216;pelt, pelt&#8217; on the 
  sidewalk that stretched out before us. Unfortunately, we each had our new jackets 
  to keep the rain from reaching our hearts. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we got to school I threw off my coat with fury 
  and stuffed it in my locker, desperately hoping that I wouldn&#8217;t have to 
  wear it again; along with the jacket went the bologna sandwich Dad made every 
  morning. I hated bologna. After school I dejectedly walked home, disappointed 
  that the rain had stopped. All that was left were puddles.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My sister started dating. She would come home late 
  at night, sometimes as late as two in the morning, either in a daze or crying 
  hysterically. She was an emotional hurricane. When she wasn&#8217;t going out 
  she complained about this guy or that guy that had the nerve to tell her the 
  truth about her; that she needed to get a life. So she tried harder and dug 
  herself deeper, hoping to find some solace in anything that came her way. She 
  went to parties, sometimes without Dad&#8217;s consent, and would have a grand 
  old time, then feel absolutely rotten the next morning. Too little or too much 
  of something. Finally she realized that this wasn&#8217;t getting her anywhere 
  and she decided to lay off the parties and the guys for awhile. This was a great 
  relief to me, since my ears were getting sore from all her whining. Dad wasn&#8217;t 
  too fond of it either, to say the least.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dad was getting better; he stopped dancing at night. 
  He still played the song once in awhile, but not over and over like before. 
  One day he met my sister and I after school and we went to lunch at Kentucky 
  Fried Chicken. He tried to make conversation with us.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Hey guys, what would you think if I went back 
  to school? You know, took a couple night classes; or maybe on the weekend&#8230;. 
  Would you mind?&#8221;<br>
  I thought about it and decided to let my sister answer.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;What classes?&#8221; she questioned.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Well, I was thinking of slowly getting my AA 
  degree in engineering. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll go all the way, but 
  I&#8217;ll look into it. It wouldn&#8217;t hurt to try, huh?&#8221; He nudged 
  me with his elbow.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Yeah, I guess.&#8221; What else could I say?<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summer was dragged into our unbusy lives. I don&#8217;t 
  know if it was the heat or what, but I couldn&#8217;t get away from the TV. 
  My boring days were spent glaring at a box with pictures moving on it. What 
  a life. Dad enrolled himself in a few summer classes, managing to keep his work 
  schedule consistent. Sometimes he really surprised me. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somehow, my sister found some &#8220;worthwhile&#8221; 
  friends who introduced her to church. She spent a lot of her time from then 
  on researching on the internet and in the library, sipping her coffee while 
  she looked up this denomination and that. Her summer seemed almost as uneventful 
  as mine. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she discovered the Catholic Church. In a calm, 
  serious tone she announced one night over the dinner table that she was to be 
  baptized on Easter the next year. Dad was deeply impressed; I could tell by 
  the penetrating look on his face. He slowly rose from his chair and embraced 
  her, telling her that he would stand by her no matter what. The next year, in 
  the presence of the family, my sister was baptized and took the name &#8216;Gemma 
  Marie&#8217;. She started going to something she called &#8216;Mass&#8217; regularly. 
  That was what Catholics did, not only on Sunday, but every day as well. She 
  went to Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament often and stayed there for hours 
  at a time, just praying. She even went to Confession. How this was a life, I 
  didn&#8217;t know; but she wasn&#8217;t crying at night, so it was fine by me. 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She tried talking to me about God and his incredible 
  mercy, and about the &#8216;heroic&#8217; saints who led &#8216;heroic&#8217; 
  lives and left &#8216;heroic&#8217; legacies. It didn&#8217;t make any sense 
  to me. But something she said about hope struck me somewhere. Something about 
  being loved, a deep, penetrating love, and that this love gives the faithful 
  hope. I didn&#8217;t know why it caught my attention; I tried to focus on it, 
  but I gave up after awhile and went back to the TV. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would walk into our room some nights and there would 
  be candles everywhere, casting shadows on the dim gray walls and filling the 
  air with a stuffy smell of burnt honey. My sister would be on her bunk, kneeling 
  next to her pillow and facing the opposite wall where there was a crucifix. 
  Her lips would be moving slightly; I think she called it meditating. She was 
  somehow relaxed by this particular environment, so I didn&#8217;t interfere. 
  I hated the smell though. Too stuffy. <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day she took me to Mass. They read from the Bible, 
  sang a few songs, and spoke in a different language during one part. My sister 
  said it was Greek or Latin. It was all the same to me. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there was one particular moment, when the priest 
  was saying something in that other language, that was different. He suddenly 
  stopped speaking and raised what he was holding, a &#8216;Eucharistic host&#8217; 
  as my sister called it, for the people to see. He held it there, suspended far 
  above his head, for a long while, and a peaceful silence filled the room. It 
  filled my mind as well. The priest then gently rested the host on the altar 
  and bent his knee before it, his head bent in reverence as far forward as it 
  would go. Then he continued, doing the same thing again, only with a cup this 
  time. I glanced at my sister and saw she was looking at me, smiling a beautiful 
  smile; her eyes said something. They held a secret, something that she couldn&#8217;t 
  express with words; a beautiful vow, a prayer. She then turned her face toward 
  the altar and serenely gazed at the crucifix above it. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was beautiful.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that day I began to notice things around me that 
  I had never noticed before in my life. At least not since Mom had been there. 
  I was more aware of light around me; I noticed for the first time how dust dances 
  on filtered sunlight, and how the moon has a bold glow. I noticed that the branches 
  of my favorite oak tree in the playground gently caress the rays that soak through 
  the leaves. I noticed the color of the clouds when the sun sinks below the horizon, 
  emitting a pinkish orange that penetrates all that stand before the horizon.<br>
  I noticed music; I would go to the church and sit in the empty gothic halls 
  as the choir sang in perfect harmony. The beautiful voices drifted through the 
  classic architecture in which my sister sat every morning; in which I had sat 
  not a week before. I began to love the harp; I even asked to receive lessons. 
  I loved the feel of caressing the strings, causing sound to float in the air; 
  beautiful music. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I began to imagine; I would see angels in my mind&#8217;s 
  eye, beautiful creatures that shared my sister&#8217;s love for God. Creatures 
  that shared my newfound hope. I noticed beauty; beauty in prayer, beauty in 
  dreams, beauty in life.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beautiful life.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My sister announced at dinner one night that she was 
  going to enter the Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration. Dad and I both snapped 
  up from our soup and gave her questioning looks; she glanced at me and smiled 
  that profound smile as she explained that the nuns dedicated their lives to 
  adoring the Lord in the most Blessed Sacrament, praying for the salvation of 
  the souls who neglected the Lord. I remembered that smile, and I finally recognized 
  the secret her eyes held. Why hadn&#8217;t I seen it before?, I wondered. It&#8217;s 
  all so clear! <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, my sister spoke to me.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Abby?&#8221; she called quietly. &#8220;Are 
  you awake?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I grunted in reply.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Do you wanna talk?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought for a moment. I wondered why she was suddenly 
  so interested in talking to me. She never had been before.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;What do you want to talk about?&#8221; I asked.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Us.&#8221; Her voice was strong and willing. 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Ok,&#8230;&#8221; I was a little hesitant; I 
  didn&#8217;t know what to say.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Do you remember Mom? Remember the walks she 
  would take us on? And when she woke us up early Christmas morning to give us 
  our gifts?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again I thought. I did remember.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;She smelled good, too. Like vanilla candles. 
  I loved how she smelled; I would bury my nose in her hair whenever she held 
  me.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remembered how beautiful her hair was.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I loved her hair. It was always so soft and 
  brown. My favorite color was brown because of her hair,&#8221; She went on.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A silence permeated the air. I held my breath for her 
  to continue.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Abby?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Mmmm?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I miss her so much.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lump rose into my throat, and my eyes began watering. 
  I wiped them with the back of my hand and said, &#8220;I miss her too.&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Abby, do you know how much I love you?&#8221;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something in my chest tightened. I didn&#8217;t know 
  what it was; I had never felt anything like it before. I closed my eyes and 
  let my own tears spill over as I heard myself say,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I love you too.&#8221; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment the rain softly began outside our window, 
  cleansing my heart.</p>
