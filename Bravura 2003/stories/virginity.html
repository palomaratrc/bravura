  <p align="center"><em>Virginity</em></p>
  <p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I lost my virginity 
    I was driving home with my mom. I was in 7th grade, and had just purchased 
    a tape called &#8220;Scumdogs of the Universe&#8221; by a band with the name 
    of Gwar. Today I know Gwar to be a group of art-school dropouts who play a 
    mix of schlock (not shock) rock and crossover speedmetal/punk. In 7th grade, 
    though, driving home from the record store with my mom, they were nothing 
    less than my GODS. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, I had never heard Gwar before buying their 
    tape, and though I&#8217;d like to say I was randomly flipping through tapes 
    and was so awestruck by the cover that I just knew I needed to have it, the 
    reality wasn&#8217;t anything so romantic: I heard their name a lot on Beavis 
    and Butthead. Hey, I was 12, whaddayawant? <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyhoo, the moment I heard &#8216;Maggots&#8217;, 
    the 2nd song on the album, I was fucked. I mean, I was just NEVER the same 
    after that. Y&#8217;see, my ma was a radio-metal head, so my &#8220;roots&#8221; 
    were &#8220;The Black Album&#8221;, &#8220;Appetite&#8221;, and a jambalaya 
    of hairrock groups. Gwar was something different, though, something more&#8230;Extreme.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my mother hated it, which was great.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#8217;t listen to Gwar anymore, but the 
    lesson &#8220;Scumdogs&#8221; taught me, which has never left me, is DIG DEEPER. 
    There&#8217;s more out there than what the radio, or your mother feeds you. 
    I&#8217;d have a hard time finding a more important lesson to learn at 12 
    years old than that. The reward for taking risks on the road less traveled? 
    Nothing less than the ethereal delusion of a universal sense of order which 
    was filtering into my 12 year old ears as Oderous shouted the chorus: &#8220;Maggots!/Maggots!/Maggots 
    are falling, falling like rain!&#8221; And I could have swore I felt a trickle 
    of blood run down my ear as my cerebral hymen was *POP* burst for the first 
    time in cognizant memory.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be six years &#8216;til I lost my virginity 
    again, but that&#8217;s okay, &#8216;cause it happened twice in the sameyear, 
    first to &#8220;The Stooges&#8221;, and second to &#8220;The Velvet Underground 
    and Nico&#8221;. As much as I&#8217;d love to say I discovered those groups 
    by stumbling across a catacomb crammed with dark hooded beings with candles 
    hovering around and worshipping golden statues of Iggy, or Lou, the reality 
    wasn&#8217;t anything so romantic: I read about &#8216;em in books.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;The Stooges&#8221; was one of the last 
    CDs I bought before I moved out of my apartment and traveled around in a van 
    after I graduated high school. By that time I was listening to Hardcore/Punk 
    virtually exclusively. I LIVED it, y&#8217;know? Still do, to an extent. I 
    feel more comfortable capitalizing the word Hardcore than god, what&#8217;s 
    that tell you? Anyhoo, &#8220;The Stooges&#8221; FUCKED me. Hard. For a very 
    LONG time. I played that CD back to back ten times daily when I first got 
    it. I never heard anything like it. I mean, I knew Black Flag, and The Ramones, 
    and even Dictators and NY Dolls, so I wasn&#8217;t completely clueless as 
    to the roots of Punk, but &#8220;The Stooges&#8221; was something else, something 
    else entirely.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That fucking album, man, that FUCKING album&#8230;I 
    saw this perverse symbolism in the guitar distortion. I mean, it was loud, 
    but it seemed like it was striving to be LOUDER, held back by the constraints 
    of amplification, and the technological limitations of the amount of sound 
    a microphone is capable of absorbing, and the percentile of that content which 
    can be accurately transferred to disc. I saw it as the perfect allegory to 
    the present state of man: tamed, limited, forced by forces outside of their 
    power to be something less that they want to be. The song structures were 
    totally bizarre, too. Not conventional at all. Verse/chorus/verse/chorus/GOOOOOOWWWWWW!!!!! 
    Where&#8217;s the hook, y&#8217;know? Fuck, I would just sit in my room, which 
    was virtually deserted, since I was leaving so soon, listen to &#8220;The 
    Stooges&#8221; and just stare at my speakers as if THEY had the answers to 
    my question of: &#8220;Exactly WHAT are these SOUNDS you two are emitting?&#8221; 
    I still haven&#8217;t quite figured that out, and neither has anyone else, 
    I hope. What I did figure out, and now had concrete proof of, is that there 
    WAS life before &#8220;Ramones&#8221;. Music had excited me before, got me 
    off, but never left me as utterly PERPLEXED as I&#8217;d be after &#8220;The 
    Stooges&#8221; ended, and right before I got<br>
    up to press play again. Now, the Velvets came three months later at a very 
    interesting time in my life. I was living in a van in San Luis Obispo, a crappy 
    college town six hours from<br>
    where I lived, but in reality, the manor of which I was living compared to 
    the lifestyle I was accustomed to months earlier, San Luis Obispo might as 
    well have been on Mars. I was shoplifting EVERYTHING, away from ANYTHING I 
    knew to be routine, sleeping illegally (yes, as ridiculous as that sounds, 
    it is possible), and basically just going nuts from living such an anarchic 
    (to a sheltered as fuck me, at least) lifestyle. Now, seeing as how my Hardcore/Punk 
    paradigm was beaten to death with a hammer by &#8220;The Stooges&#8221;, and 
    my work/school/rent paradigm was shattered by a 1984 Toyota van and a life 
    of vagrancy, I was ready for the $4.95 used cassette version of &#8220;The 
    Velvet Underground And Nico&#8221; that would come into my way via the local 
    SLO used record store. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just walking around town listening to 
    this masterpiece over and over again. First impressions? &#8216;Sunday Morning&#8217;: 
    &#8220;huh, just sounds like Dylan. What&#8217;s all the hype about?&#8221; 
    &#8216;I&#8217;m Waiting For My Man&#8217;: &#8220;Hey, is the drummer playing 
    blast beats? This is more like it!&#8221; After that it was just a blur. I 
    remember listening to nothing but that tape for days, then weeks, and really, 
    I guess I never stopped. But no, I was listening to &#8220;The Velvet Underground 
    and Nico&#8221; and ONLY &#8220;The Velvet Underground and Nico&#8221; when 
    I first got that tape. Of course I didn&#8217;t understand it. I&#8217;m pretty 
    sure I must not have liked it. I believe it was some sort of angelic/demonic 
    force smacking my head everytime each side would end saying<br>
    &#8220;trun it over, fucker and LISTEN. There&#8217;s something it&#8217;s 
    trying to TELL you!&#8221; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were The Velvet Underground trying to teach 
    me? <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I figured out after listening to &#8220;The 
    Velvet Underground And Nico&#8221; enough times that they were teaching me 
    about BEAUTY. And ugliness. And beauty in ugliness, and vice versa. It was 
    teaching me how to listen to the confessions of a junky and not pass judgment. 
    How to watch people engaging in acts of depravity and perversion the same 
    way I&#8217;d watch people do their shopping at the mall. It taught me what 
    humanity is all about, and most importantly how to neither fetishize nor villainise 
    the extreme hideous,beautiful and even MUNDANE inherent nature of our species. 
    Simply acknowledge these traits, and know that they DO exist. Don&#8217;t 
    succumb to, or use human nature as an excuse for spiritual complacency, though. 
    But The Velvet Underground didn&#8217;t teach me that. I had to learn that 
    part on my own. Everyone who truly adheres to that axiom does. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the fourth time I lost my virginity, it 
    wasn&#8217;thalf as interesting: I had sex with a girl for the first time. 
    In a trailer park. Coincidentally (though very much so a pre-meditated and 
    calculated move on my part) while listening to The Stooges, &#8216;Now I Wanna 
    Be Your Dog&#8217;, to be exact. I include this technical footnote for three 
    reasons: one; as just that, a technical footnote, two; I figure after usin&#8217; 
    alla&#8217; them FANCY words at-towards the end o&#8217; thet lass par-O-graph 
    I may have lost the reader&#8217;s interest, and there&#8217;s nothing like 
    a hunka-red hot unprotected trailer SEX to proverbially lasso those attention 
    spans back where they belong, and three; because as with all the other times 
    I lost my virginity, I learned a very valuable lesson: &#8220;Sure, that was 
    nice, but really, I&#8217;d rather just listen to the Velvet Underground and 
    save myself some trouble.&#8221;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I&#8217;m still losing my virginity. I lose 
    my virginity all the time! I lose my virginity every time I hear a true friend 
    crying on the other end of the phone line, without fail. I lost my virginity 
    dancing alone in my room to &#8216;Lust For Life&#8217; after trying to seduce 
    one of my friends (he turned me down, of course, the FAG), or when I played 
    an improvised show with a very LOUD electric guitar in the laundry room of 
    my old apartment complex late at night, getting yelled at by one of the neighbor 
    kids while making up lyrics to &#8216;Loose&#8217;. Hell, just the other night 
    I lost my virginity AGAIN. Nothing quite as romantic, it was just the first 
    time I ever beat the SHIT out of someone.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;ll save you all some time and myself 
    some pages and ink and just let you know that this fucker had it coming. I 
    promised myself, my friends, hell, my grandma, that the next time I saw this 
    kid, I would beat the shit out of him. I had kicked him out of town, and he 
    promised after doing what he did that I&#8217;d never have to see him again. 
    I got tipped off that he was back in town, and me and a friend went to find 
    his van and slash his tires.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, like I said, you&#8217;ll really have to 
    trust me when I say this fucking kid had it coming. Turns out when we did 
    find his van, we found him too, laying down in the back. I started to bang 
    on the doors, but he wouldn&#8217;t come out. So I kept banging for, like, 
    15 minutes: &#8220;C&#8217;mon, dude, you&#8217;re not getting out of this. 
    Just come outside so we can talk.&#8221; But the guy just wouldn&#8217;t come 
    out. My friend figures out a way to kick the latch off his side door and sort 
    of pry the thing open, making it possible for me to just climb in there with 
    the guy. <br>
    So there I was, just sitting in there with him, and I KNEW I was gonna hafta 
    clobber him, &#8216;cause I promised myself I would. He wasn&#8217;t responding 
    to my attempts to get him to come outside, so I start to drag him out by his 
    pants, and then he starts putting up a resistance instead of just laying there. 
    He sits up, and I want all of you to LISTEN now: time itself was holding its 
    breath. A sort of silence that weighs heavier than the mere absence of sound 
    now drowns the interior of the van. In reality it was just a few seconds, 
    a single moment, but it was the kind of moment that stays with you for a very 
    long time after it passes, the kind of moment that PENETRATES&#8230;.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then I punched his fucking head. Now me 
    and my friends, sure, we roughhoused, and would play around when we were younger, 
    but I never punched someone I really considered a disgusting person. I&#8217;ve 
    been punched by people I considered disgusting before, but I always got out 
    of The Fight. This was totally different, though. With pre-meditation and 
    malice I punched this fucker square in the open face. He curled up into a 
    ball on the ground. I punched him again in the head, but once he covered that 
    up, I punched him a few times in the ribs, then I kicked him in the ribs, 
    and then I slammed the back of my heel into the back of his head. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, I told you he had it coming! I did exactly 
    what I promised I&#8217;d do. At first I felt bad, of course, simply for acting 
    on such a base and primitive level, but really, it was just something that 
    had to be done. I acted not in a blood thirsty brutish rage, but in the manor 
    of which one sighs heavily before they clock in for work. I set a goal and 
    I accomplished it, and now I really do feel a whole lot better. The lesson 
    learned from my first true act of extroverted physical violence?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Sure, that was nice, but really, I&#8217;d 
    rather just listen to the Velvet Underground and save myself some trouble.&#8221;</p>
