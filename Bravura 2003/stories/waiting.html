  <p align="center"><em>Waiting to Make a Move</em></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roberto had not shaved 
    this morning. He wondered just how scruffy that now 36-hour growth protruding 
    from his face looked. Slowly, ever so slowly, he reached up to his face with 
    a slightly shaking right hand. He touched the side of his cheek, felt the 
    inevitable forest that was now growing there, and then began moving downward 
    to his jaw. There it grew even thicker and coarser. There was no doubt in 
    his mind that he looked pretty rough right now. He normally was a clean-shaven 
    and respectable looking man. Hardly a morning ever went by that he did not 
    repeat that process of making his face appear soft and youthful. Clean looking. 
    It was a part of his life to look that way. Expensive three-piece suits, the 
    briefcase, absolute sociality, were his life on any given day. Except today 
    had been a day away from the routine. And now here he was at this time, this 
    place, looking like a transient who had wandered in off the streets...<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a shame.<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked across the space of the large 
    room he was now in and made eye contact with another young man only a few 
    years younger than himself in age. It was his first attempt to make some kind 
    of contact with anyone else here and it was a success. More than a success. 
    This young man appeared to be quite large, in a fit kind of way. He looked 
    strong and powerful. Solid. At this moment in Roberto&#8217;s life that was 
    what he needed. The soft gentle curves a woman or the fleeting strength of 
    an elder gentleman nearby would not be very useful to him right now. Even 
    the average man might lack what he needed unless he had a sudden rush of adrenaline 
    racing through his blood.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man, tall, broad shoulders 
    and powerful looking arms, had a shaved head which undoubtedly helped him 
    look tough on any average day. But now the young man, his eyes locked on Roberto&#8217;s, 
    showed that he was scared like a frightened child. That petrified look in 
    the stranger&#8217;s eyes shook Roberto to his bones. A sudden rush of guilt 
    raced through him for what he was thinking right now. He closed his eyes&#8230;<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pictured Juan, so young and still 
    new to the world. Innocent. His 13-year-old son, the young version of himself, 
    would be wondering where he was today if he went through with this. Today 
    was one of Roberto&#8217;s few days off of work. An actual day off unlike 
    the mock ones that filled up the space of nearly all of Roberto&#8217;s so 
    called free time. He had promised Juan that he would stop by his mother&#8217;s 
    house to pick him up early in the afternoon and then the two of them would 
    spend the rest of the day fishing off of the sandy shores of the Gulf. Juan 
    loved those moments, Roberto knew this. He felt so much guilt over the time 
    he never spent with his son. Especially now... What right do I have to do 
    this?<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had to. With his lips, Roberto formed 
    a singular word. &#8220;Now&#8221;. The silent word carried over across the 
    room to the scared younger man. The young man&#8217;s eyes grew large. His 
    face filled with confusion. Roberto could not tell whether that clearly evident 
    confusion was because the young man did not understand him or because he did 
    not know what to do with that word. That thought. That choice.&nbsp; Roberto 
    repeated it again, much more boldly and clearly, and this time a faint whisper 
    hugged the word as it formed on his lips. The young man&#8217;s eyes grew 
    even larger. He began to shake so violently that Roberto could see it from 
    his position almost twenty feet away. Slowly the man&#8217;s head turned from 
    side to side, a clear &#8220;No&#8221; given back to Roberto. Roberto responded 
    back with another &#8220;Now&#8221;, this time even more audible and obvious.<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young and pretty woman next to him, 
    dressed attractively in minimal business attire, &#8220;ssshhhed&#8221;&nbsp; 
    Roberto. Roberto ignored her and continued pressing the young man across the 
    room. Ignore her as he tried, the sudden interruption by the woman into the 
    two gentlemen&#8217;s silent communication did play with Roberto&#8217;s memory. 
    His memory of soft skin, angel-like wavy blond hair, green eyes and long slender 
    legs&#8230;<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amber, that dream that could never be. 
    How she had never fitted into his fast life. There had never been time, only 
    fast commercials that allowed the smallest taste of love to fill their marriage. 
    And then she was gone with Juan, and now, a new lover from what Juan had so 
    accidentally leaked out recently. He had often dreamt that somehow there would 
    be another place and another time where the two of them could be together 
    again. But not now. Now his time for that was over. Now it was suddenly too 
    late. Now&#8230;.<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now!<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roberto knew that he had waited too long, 
    but he made his move anyway. He suddenly began sprinting across the room with 
    all of the strength he could muster in his reluctant legs. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Now!&#8221; he yelled.<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man across the room put his 
    hands up wildly and turned to face two men standing next to him. Both of those 
    men held a piece of metal and synthetic material tightly in their hands. One 
    pressed the metal firmly against the young man&#8217;s head and then a flash 
    erupted sending his brains scattered across the room, across other dead bodies 
    lying on the floor with similar fatal injuries. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roberto suddenly stopped in his tracks 
    just two feet away from the ski-masked men standing in front of him. A 45-caliber 
    judgment of life and death pointed directly at him now. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roberto 
    then heard the loud crack of a pistol shoot off&nbsp;somewhere next to him 
    and the attractive woman that had told him to &#8220;ssshhh&#8221; moments 
    ago flew violently to the ground.<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shaking now, at the knees, at 
    his waist, his whole body. He took one look around the lobby room of the First 
    Union National Bank. Around him, a sea of motionless bodies lay on the floor, 
    covered in blood. Other than the three well-armed men dressed in black and 
    wearing ski masks, Roberto was the only one left standing alive. He closed 
    his eyes and thought of Amber and Juan... <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#8217;m sorry I waited.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their images resting inside his mind 
    were the last he saw.</p>
