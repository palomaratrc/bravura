<p><b>&quot;You, Me, Us&quot;<br>
</b>Nicole Burton</p>
<p>Dual aqueous entities <br>
Swam in endless desert ocean <br>
As midnight moon ascended over jagged mountain tops<br>
Moments windswept dusty gaze began their journey <br>
Together in search of life love rhythm<br>
Amidst buzzing light beings <br>
They shared Zeppelin song names and Tolkien references<br>
While lounging on weathered cushions <br>
Observing heaven sky, heads arced back<br>
Wishing for falling stars<br>
Kicked up dust clouds<br>
Swirled around suffocated breath <br>
Campfire stove heated jasmine flower tea too hot <br>
Thoughtful blowing to lukewarm <br>
She sipped deeply his ceramic cup<br>
A newly discovered comfort <br>
Found in the embrace of this tender lover<br>
Tingling vibrations on her skin<br>
His kisses sent to Buddha belly<br>
Gift of pure gentleness<br>
Together, connected as one<br>
Softly their heartbeats<br>
Synchronized in life love rhythm<br>
The union of dual aqueous entities<br>
You… me… us</p>
