<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The asphalt radiates 
heat stolen from the sun to create an optical illusion similar to what is 
described when nomads tell of desert mirages conceived by the hallucinogenic 
effects of physical exhaustion combined with the delirium of isolation that 
somehow lend the mind to create images to fill in the gaps the eyes fail to 
report due to dehydration that causes the body to trigger an impulse that 
reminds us to consider the fact that we are indeed thirsty and need to consume 
water or else we may die in the middle a desert full of sand and highly evolved 
organisms who mutter languages unfathomable to human beings who themselves 
evolved from lower bipedal primates whom of course share at least one 
evolutionary ancestor with the primitive life forms that now outnumber the 
lonely nomad that is the subject of this example that was originally conceived 
to further elaborate upon the analogy introduced at the beginning of this 
sentence that exploits grammatical law to create a literary effect that intends 
to suggest a general sense of futility and frustration concerning the larger 
scenario of man and his place in this universe of stars and planets and 
computers and technology like cell phones and television and battery-powered 
remote controls that allow us to navigate the dense and intimidating spectrum of 
the greater Information Superhighway so that we can at least momentarily and 
periodically catch a glimpse of how our dreams may some day manifest themselves 
on an eighty-nine-million inch high-definition plasmaflatscreenwondermachine 
that announces the resurrection of the messiah himself who has come for the sole 
intention of claiming those souls who by chance decided to choose the correct 
gospel from a plethora of fraudulent documents concerning the question of the 
possibility of an afterlife after this life on the third planet from our solar 
central location relative to our solar system which is only a small fraction of 
the larger Milky Way galaxy that makes up for approximately 
1/95775400000000000000000000000000000000

of our maniacal universe that seems so small when compared to the capacity of 
the human brain to create absurd abstract analytical anomalies about animalistic 
alternatives to atypical apples in a barrel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span></p>
