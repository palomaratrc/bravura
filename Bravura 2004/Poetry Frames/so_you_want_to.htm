<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don’t lose sight 
of your psychological weirdnesses, it will only add to how you write.&nbsp; Few 
guarantee it!&nbsp; That’s right, you heard me, keep them.&nbsp; It is one of the most 
things that you are able to relate to on a personal level…you’re remembering 
aren’t you?&nbsp; Let me go first, you know, there’s a lot of experience here.&nbsp; Let 
me pick your brain by bringing up the thought that make you cringe, and say 
“that’s not me anymore.”&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; It still is, it never leaves you.&nbsp; Then, look at 
your nails, and see the redness that surrounds your short, stubbed nail?&nbsp; Well, 
do you?&nbsp; Go ahead, look, like what you see?&nbsp; Didn’t think so!&nbsp; Admit it, their 
so short, you can’t even puck up a piece of furniture for your dad without the 
pressure surfacing to your pudgy fingers, the redness quickly turning white.&nbsp; 
Now, look in the mirror sideways.&nbsp; Yeah, you heard right, sideways.&nbsp; How’s your 
posture?&nbsp; Does it slouch, leaving you looking like your confidence isn’t where 
it should be?&nbsp; This is a sad situation.&nbsp; What can you do to fix it?&nbsp; Well, since 
you are already looking at the mirror, why don’t you smile.&nbsp; Now try putting 
your fingers in your mouth at each corner, and pull.&nbsp; Is it numb, and funny 
feeling?&nbsp; Smile again.&nbsp; Stop looking at your hair, and turning your head as you 
look at each angle of your face.&nbsp; If you’re going to look, do it right.&nbsp; Go into 
your room and turn on your favorite music.&nbsp; Now go back into the mirror and turn 
your face from side to side.&nbsp; Feel the self-esteem rising?&nbsp; Everything feeling 
alright?&nbsp; Go ahead, take your move to a piece of paper and pencil, write what 
comes off the top of your head.&nbsp; And the rest will follow.</font></span></p>
