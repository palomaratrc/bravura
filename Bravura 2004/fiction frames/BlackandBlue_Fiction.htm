<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The night I turned 22 
I ate dinner at B.B. King’s. Rick’s eyes were so blue then. Clear blue. Sky 
blue. My blue. The spirit of love and hate and miserable, messy obsessive love 
reverberated through me-plucked me, played me, my sinew the six string. Each sad 
note, each blowsy bluesy note vibrating, shaking me, altering me until I was the 
blues and the blues were me. Musical possession- the demon, playing me- plying 
me, making ready to receive the next evening’s sorrow.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The Belt, a coiled 
black snake above me, poised, ready to strike. What it struck in me was fear. 
Fingers around my neck, darker than my dark, tightened with each attempt to 
grasp for air. Light blurred the edges of the darkness, and each slam of my head 
on the wall sprinkled my mind’s night sky with stars. Muffled sound traveled 
through an avalanche of icy cold snow. Fight. Fight or you’ll die like this. And 
somehow I broke free.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">My shame was black. I stood 
with my face silhouetted against the white wall as the officer shot photos of my 
wounds. “you shouldn’t have let them take pictures of you Vonda whispered. 
“they’ll keep it on file and use you in a line-up.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And my hair, before so 
carefully arranged, was disheveled, torn from my scalp and strewn across the 
floor in tufts like black cotton. BlackBlue. Black men. Blues. Black eye. Blues. 
Black heart. Blues. Black men black heart black eye blues.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">“It was supposed to be 
my birthday,” I told the officer. “Yeah, but your birthday was yesterday, “he 
replied curtly. And so it was. My da. Birthday. Birthday blues day. Rick’s blue 
eyes, Alfonso’s black heart. A photo negative.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Rick – tall. Blonde 
hair. Blue eyes. Bisque skin against my mocha. I loved to see our bodies woven 
together in the mooonlight. He would almost glow. And my dark warmth brightened 
him, elevated him, and his large soft hands on my brown skin accentuated the 
blue blood in his veins. But it saddened my heart to watch his hands. To see his 
watch sweeping slowl, marking the time and making me feel like a cheap black 
whore. I gave him my back, for I couldn’t face his watch. And my back pleased 
him, and he pulled me snugly close.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Alfonso-tall. Black 
hair. Dark eyes. Darkest soul. What do you call a tone on tone pattern? That’s 
what it was like to be tangled in his arms. He took my hand and slipped it down 
his pants. What they say – it’s true. I kept feeling more, more more of his 
warmth in my cold hands. Endless warmth, stores of incredible warmth. First 
fear, then feelings – feelings in deep places I never had feelings. Long, dark 
yearnings in deep places I never knew existed. Then release – release after 
waiting so long, waiting my life for that screaming discharge of volcanic lava 
to flow, flow from ancient secret places hidden from all non – native explorers. 
Natives understand the volcano, understand its fearsome power. And I was its 
virgin sacrifice.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The beatings I 
suffered at the hands of this black man – they were as brutal as sugar is sweet. 
And it was this very juxtaposition of danger and longing that intensified the 
relationship. I was dancing at the edge of hell, stripping my soul bare to 
Satan. But I became muddled and confused. Since sex can’t be consensual whern 
you’re seven, Alfonso was my first black lover. But the experiences were no 
differrent. At firs, it felt good, scary good until fear and enjoyment were one 
and the same. And somehow in it all, I became again seven, and I was weak and 
small and no one could hear me scream.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">To alfonso, there was 
no word “no”. And what was once sex became rape. Rape of my core self, again a 
splitting, again a maladaptive response to the inexplicable combining of longing 
and fear. Rape&nbsp; of my spirit. Because I couldn’t say no. I don’t think that 
anyone who knows me, or knew me understood that I was not a woman making her own 
choices. I was a child and I was trapped with a phone cord around my neck and 
the TV firing rapidly in the dark. He raped me, and did it again and again while 
I lay there still believing I was helpless. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The uber – scary film 
noir effect of the rapidly flashing TV in the dark illuminated the room like 
machine gunfire at night imprint the scene indelibly in my mind. White, black. 
Black, white, whiter, black, white, black white – like being beeat senseless – 
some things I see very clearly and others are forever plunged in darkness. Being 
snatched up like a rag doll with useless limbs. Twisted woolen pigtails 
bejeweled with a rainbow of plastic barrettes being slammed down again and again 
and again. Useless, hopeless thinking of escape. Watch the wall. Watch the TV 
slam light against the wall. I lay there utterly, completely powerless.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">
<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">I am a battered woman. 
I am locked in a struggle that really only began when the abuse stopped. So many 
nights I am in the tempest, being thrown and shaken and dashed upon the rocks. I 
wake up drenched and cold and bleeding from wounds I thought had healed. My 
doctor calls it major recurring depression. But I’ve just been beaten black and 
blue.</font></span></p>
