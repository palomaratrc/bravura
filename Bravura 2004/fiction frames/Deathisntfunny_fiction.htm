&quot;Death Isn’t Funny&quot;</span></font></p>
<p align="center" style="text-align: center"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">
Jenn Dugan</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">I once knew a guy named Mark. He was in my 5<sup>th</sup> 
period American history class our senior year of high school, 2001. He was a 
quiet student who, as far as I could tell, had no friends. He dressed well. He 
wore collared shirts and sometimes suits to school. I wondered if he was a 
Jehovah's Witness, but I didn't think so. He looked too evil to be a Jehovah's 
Witness. During lunch, he went into the library alone and stayed there until the 
bell for 5th period rang. I once saw him reading a book about World War II. I 
figured he was smart.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">There wasn’t much you could tell about Mark 
by watching him in class. He sat in the front row, off to the side. He never 
talked to anyone. He never looked at anyone. All he did was stare straight 
ahead. Actually, it wasn’t really a <i>stare</i>; it was more of a glare. And 
his glare was always directed at Mr. Meredith's &quot;Declaration of Self-Esteem&quot; 
poster, which was posted on the wall in front of Mark’s desk. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">I had always wondered what it was about that 
poster that Mark didn't like. A barage of large-font, bold words that promoted 
pride and feeling good about oneself, the Declaration of Self-Esteem was framed 
by the terms &quot;I AM ME&quot; and &quot;I AM OKAY&quot; in gigantic red letters. Though the 
writer of the Declaration of Self-Esteem had elected to use commas, periods 
seemed to have eluded him or her, and the writer had chosen to replace them with 
hyphens. Mr. Meredith, who hates grammatical incorrectness or grammatical 
creativity, used the Declaration of Self-Esteem to illustrate for us how not to 
write our papers. I wondered if Mark hated grammatical incorrectness. I wondered 
if he was creative. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">I once wondered what his handwriting was 
like. At first I imagined his written words were cursive and jagged, elegant. 
Fanged writing. But, once, I finished writing an in-class essay before he did, 
and I waited until he deposited his at Mr. Meredith’s desk before I took mine 
up. I saw his handwriting then. It was chicken scratch, like most guys’ 
handwriting. So maybe he was an Internet addict and didn’t handwrite much. I 
wondered what websites he frequented. I wondered if Mark glared at the computer 
the same way he glared at the Declaration of Self-Esteem.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Maybe, when Mark stared like that, he wasn't 
seeing the poster at all. Maybe something was eating away at him. What if he’d 
had a traumatic childhood, and it expressed itself through Mark's staring 
maniacally at the Declaration of Self-Esteem during history class? Mark had nice 
eyes. A little evil and maniacal, maybe. &nbsp;But nice.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;You <i>like</i> him, don’t you?&quot; my friend 
Nancy asked, laughing. Nancy always laughs. Even if something’s not funny, 
she’ll laugh. I think it’s a nervous tick she has. I once asked her what she was 
laughing at, and she looked embarrassed and said she didn’t know. Then she 
laughed again.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Nancy and I were standing in the Gay/Lesbian 
section at Barnes &amp; Noble, flipping through <i>The Joy of Gay Sex</i>, and 
waiting for our parents to pick us up from the mall.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;No,&quot; I answered her, &quot;I don’t like him.&quot;
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;You should talk to him,&quot; Nancy said, 
giggling at the pictures of nude men engaged in various sexual acts. &quot;Elise, it 
would make Mark’s <i>life</i> if you talked to him. You just <i>know</i> he’s 
one of those guys who’s going to shoot up the school someday. Maybe your love 
could stop all that.&quot; </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;Problem: I don’t like him,&quot; I said. &quot;I guess 
the school is just going to have to suffer. I wonder if he’s gay. I never see 
him look at girls.&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;You never see him look at guys, either.&quot; 
Nancy laughed.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;True. I wonder, if Mark and I ever dated, 
what he’d say if I asked him to make out with another guy in front of me.&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Nancy laughed and said, &quot;Come on, let’s get 
out of here.&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">We went to Nancy’s house after that. We 
watched <i>Requiem for a Dream</i>. Mark kind of looks like the white guy in 
that movie, at the end when his mother dreams he’s dressed up nice and 
successful. Only, Mark doesn’t have black hair; he has dark blond hair. And 
Mark’s eyes are brown, not blue. And Mark’s kind of short. I guess Mark doesn’t 
really look anything like the white guy in <i>Requiem for a Dream</i>. But he 
still reminds me of him.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">After we watched the movie, we went into 
Nancy’s bedroom, and she showed me her new criminal analysis book. It was a 
college-level textbook that Nancy bought &quot;just because.&quot; She’s strange. She’s 
the only person I know who saves her money for textbooks and reads them of her 
own free will. So we were flipping through Nancy’s new and exciting textbook, 
and looking at the pictures of raped and mutilated women, ice-picked children, 
and decapitated men, when Nancy suddenly laughed and said, &quot;Do you think I’d 
make a good cop?&quot; </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;No,&quot; I said. Nancy was one of the most 
athletic girls in school, she was level-headed, and she was good about following 
rules, most of the time. But I could picture her standing at the front door of 
some poor woman’s house, telling her that her husband has just died, and 
suddenly bursting into fits of laughter.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">It’s sad, how a person can be so right for a 
job, but so wrong for it, all because of one tragic flaw. I wondered what Mark’s 
tragic flaw was. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;Maybe he stutters,&quot; I said aloud.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;No, wait,&quot; Nancy said. &quot;Why wouldn’t I make 
a good cop?&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;I dunno…,&quot; I said. &quot;You’re really… 
optimistic. And by that I mean you have a really broad sense of humor. Do you 
suppose Mark stutters? Maybe that’s why he never talks.&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Nancy fell onto her bed and laughed. It was 
her genuine laugh, the one that possesses her, throws her head back, exposes her 
throat, and sends her body into spasms. Nancy’s laughter is deep and a little 
malicious-sounding, when she’s laughing about something that she thinks is 
actually funny.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Nancy straightened up and said, &quot;God, Elise, 
you are so <i>self-centered</i>!&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Where the hell did <i>that</i> come from?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;All you ever talk about is this guy you 
like,&quot; Nancy said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;Okay, first of all, I don’t like him. And 
second, if I’m talking about Mark all the time, how does that make me <i>self</i>-centered?&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;It isn’t that we talk about Mark; it’s that 
we talk about what <i>you</i> want to talk about. Always. And, you know, Elise, 
that’s not so bad because you usually come up with some interesting topics. But 
lately all you’ve been talking about is Mark, the guy you don’t like but can’t 
seem to shut up about.&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;I don’t like him.&quot; </span>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;Fine.&quot; </span>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;I just think he’s interesting.&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;<i>Fine</i>.&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;I think—&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;Don’t you dare say another word about Mark,&quot; 
Nancy said, chuckling. &quot;The next time you talk about that guy, I’m going to tell 
him that you like him, and I’m going to tell him that he should seriously 
consider investing in a restraining order, because you, my dear friend, are a 
little scary when you’re <i>interested</i> in someone.&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">So I didn’t say anything else about Mark that 
night. And that disturbed me. Maybe I <i>did</i> like Mark. Why else would I 
care about Nancy telling him? If I honestly didn’t like him, I wouldn’t care 
about his opinion of me, and I would have kept chattering away.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;Maybe he has low self-esteem,&quot; I said the 
next day as Nancy and I boarded the bus to school.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;What?&quot; Nancy said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;Nothing.&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">We showed the bus driver our passes and found 
two empty seats next to each other. &quot;Maybe that’s why he’s always glaring at 
that poster,&quot; I said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;What?&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;Nothing.&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;Are you talking about Mark?&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;No.&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">We rode to school in silence. I had nothing 
to talk about (nothing Nancy wanted to hear about, anyway), and Nancy wasn’t 
used to instigating conversation. Smart girl, that one; but not very social. 
But, then, it’s not like she <i>needs</i> to talk. Nancy can ride across town 
without saying a word to her best friend sitting right beside her, and you can 
tell she’s completely comfortable with it. I, on the other hand, feel weird not 
talking.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">A little red-headed boy around eight years 
old sitting in front of me turned around and stared at me. I hate kids. Nancy 
saw the boy and started laughing. The boy turned to her and smiled. &quot;What’s 
funny?&quot; he asked her innocently.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Nancy smiled and turned away without 
answering. The boy turned back to me. He held up a large pad of sketch paper. 
&quot;Do you want to drawl?&quot; he asked me.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Nancy laughed again.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">He turned to her. &quot;What’s funny?&quot; he asked 
again. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;Nothing, sweetie,&quot; Nancy said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">For the rest of the bus ride, the little boy 
stared at me. Occasionally, he stared at Nancy. But mostly, he stared at me. 
&quot;What are you staring at?&quot; I finally asked him.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">The little boy pointed at me and grinned.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">I was so glad when I finally got off that 
bus.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">I wanted to talk. I <i>needed</i> to talk. 
&quot;Nancy?&quot; I said before I could stop myself. &quot;Do you think Mark’s a Jehovah’s 
Witness?&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;Oh, I am <i>so</i> telling him about the 
restraining order!&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;No! Wait! I forgot!&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;No, you had your chance.&quot; Nancy sped up to 
her 1<sup>st</sup> period class, and I suffered the rest of the morning. Lunch 
came around, and when we met to eat together, I begged Nancy not to tell Mark 
anything. She refused to speak to me, unless it was to say how many more minutes 
until lunch ended, along with my life. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">“<i>Please</i>, Nancy?” I said as I watched 
her stuff a piece of ham sandwich into her mouth. How could she <i>eat</i> at a 
time like this? She was about to ruin my entire <i>life</i>! Nancy is a sick 
individual. And she was ignoring me. “</span><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Nancy!”</span></i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">“If you don’t quit bothering me while I’m 
trying to eat,” she said, “I’m going to tell Mark that you wondered whether or 
not he’s gay, in addition to telling him that you like him.”</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Most people bite their tongues when they’re 
trying to keep themselves from talking. (At least, that’s what TV says.) I bite 
the inside of my cheek when I’m trying to shut myself up. This time, I bit my 
cheek really hard, and I felt a small sliver of flesh swish around inside my 
mouth before I instinctively swallowed it. I gagged as I tasted blood seeping 
onto my tongue. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">“Drama isn’t going to work on me,” Nancy 
said, laughing. “Act like you’re dying all you want, it’s not going to stop me 
from telling him.” </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">I forgot the pain in my mouth and swallowed 
the blood. “You <i>can’t</i> tell him!”</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Nancy ignored me.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Finally, the bell ending lunch rang, and we 
gathered our books and started that long trek to our history class, my heart 
racing. &quot;Please, Nancy? Please don’t tell him! You’re not going to tell him what 
I said about him being gay, are you?&quot; I whispered desperately to her as we 
walked on. She ignored me.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">As we approached our history class, I started 
to feel sick. Blood from where I’d bitten my cheek drizzled down my throat and 
into my empty stomach. I couldn’t go to class. I couldn’t do it. I’d throw up if 
I went in there. As though she’d read my thoughts, Nancy grabbed my hand and 
squeezed it. And it was strange— even though, at that moment, I hated Nancy, I 
felt better.&nbsp; I felt comforted. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">We entered history class together, and, to my 
utter relief, Mark wasn’t there.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">“Yes!” I screamed, throwing my books onto my 
desk, and jumping around like a dork, grinning. Everyone was staring at me, but 
I didn’t care. Mark wasn’t there! “Yes! Yes! Yes!” </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Someone said something about an Herbal 
Essences commercial, and I heard Nancy laughingly mutter, &quot;Lucky.”</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Nancy and I sat down.&nbsp; The late bell rang, 
but Mr. Meredith hadn’t shown up yet, so I turned around and started talking to 
Nancy. “I hate you, you know that?”</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">“I know,” she said with a grin.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">“Were you really going to tell him?” I 
whispered </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Nancy nodded. “I wasn’t going to say anything 
about the gay thing, though. But I <i>was</i> going to tell him you like him. 
You <i>do</i>, don’t you?” </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">“I don’t know,” I said, and it was the truth. 
“I guess do, or else I wouldn’t care, right? I wonder… I wonder if he would like 
me.”</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Nancy shrugged. “I guess we’ll see tomorrow,” 
she said, smiling evilly.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">By now, a few more minutes had passed, Mr. 
Meredith still hadn’t arrived, and the class had started their own discussion: 
How many minutes can a teacher be late before the class is allowed to leave?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;If the teacher’s fifteen minutes late,&quot; 
someone in the back said, &quot;then we can leave. That’s the rule.&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">“No, I think it’s ten minutes,” someone else 
said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Mr. Meredith and Mrs. Gregor, one of the 
counselors, walked in just then, and the class grew silent. Mr. Meredith stood 
near the door of the classroom and stared at the floor. Mrs. Gregor seemed 
distraught, though not as much as Mr. Meredith. &quot;Guys,&quot; Mrs. Gregor said, &quot;I 
have some bad news.&quot;&nbsp; The class grew very still. Mrs. Gregor continued, &quot;One of 
your classmates, Mark Hasle, passed away early this morning.&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;<i>Why</i>?&quot; I said. I felt numb and sick. 
&quot;How?&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Mrs. Gregor paused. Then she said, “He 
swallowed too many pills.” Mrs. Gregor continued to speak, but I didn’t hear 
anything else. I looked at Mr. Meredith, who had turned his back to the class. 
He took his glasses off and bowed his head to wipe his eyes. A few students 
shifted in their seats. I turned to look at Nancy who sat behind me, and, out of 
habit, I glanced at Mark’s desk. Empty.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">I looked at Nancy. She looked very solemn, 
and she looked straight ahead. I didn’t occur to me until many months later that 
she hadn’t laughed.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">The day it occurred to me was the last day of 
school. We had just received our yearbooks, and I was flipping through mine when 
I came across a page consumed by a familiar face that stung my eyes and still 
had the power to make me wonder. Mark’s senior picture stared up at me from a 
page that had been dedicated entirely to him.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">It was a strange picture. His hair was 
glossier than it had been in real life, and there was a light aura around him. 
Mark’s picture was like most senior pictures: a lie. Yeah, it looked good, but 
it wasn’t real. Where was his maniacal glare? Mark looked so <i>happy</i> in 
this picture. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">No one knew why Mark committed suicide. There 
were rumors that he’d been abused. Rumors that he had never had any friends. 
Rumors that he was a Nazi in league with an underground cult connected to the 
shootings at Columbine. But no one really knew, and after a month or so, no one 
really seemed to care.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">I read the short paragraph written below 
Mark’s picture, hoping to find some clue, some missing puzzle piece.&nbsp; </span>
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">In this first sentence, I discovered his 
birthday: November 2, 1983. That meant he was a Scorpio, the dangerous and evil 
Sign of the zodiac. I continued reading. According to the writer of the 
paragraph, Mark enjoyed writing poetry about nature and God.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">“Huh,” I said.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">I read on. <i>Mark also spent several of his 
weekends volunteering at a local hospital for handicapped children.</i></span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">I quit reading. I closed my yearbook and set 
it aside. All of a sudden, I started laughing. Then I cried. Then I wondered: 
Why didn’t Nancy laugh the day they announced Mark had died.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">I asked her later that day. She just looked 
at me like I was crazy, and said, “Death isn’t funny.”</span></font></p>
