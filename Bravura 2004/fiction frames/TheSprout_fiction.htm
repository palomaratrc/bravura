<font face="Verdana">By Brad Hunt</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's beautiful,&quot; the withered man gasped through his 
cracked bloody lips.&nbsp; &quot;Absolutely breathtaking. <i>Look</i> at this.&quot;&nbsp; 
</font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A snowy white desert reached for miles in each 
direction, varying only slightly atop the bloody remains of an empire.&nbsp; No 
sound, not even wind, dared break the reverence of the scene. Dry flakes of 
powder still aimlessly wandered through the air, wondering wistfully what now to 
do.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the silence soon died behind fits of thunderous 
laughter.&nbsp; &quot;YESTERDAY! HA! It seems like millennia, but just yesterday I lay <i>
here</i> in the shadows of a billion year's work.&nbsp; Towering examples of man's 
glory.&nbsp; Rushing sounds of flowing people.&nbsp; Every time you turned, there it was.&nbsp; 
The power of man!&nbsp; Close your eyes and the imprints still remain.&nbsp; Cover your 
ears and the sounds can still be heard.&nbsp; Sleep, and your dreams are a collage of 
victories, dancing through your mind to serve as comfort through the night.&nbsp; 
Even now, look!&nbsp; See the power of man!&quot;&nbsp; He feebly grabbed a heap of ashes from 
the ground, and pressed them to his lips. &quot;Taste what he has done -- what he 
worked so hard to accomplish!&nbsp; Look at it! It's magnificent!&quot;&nbsp; 
</font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there was nothing.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His soaring speech echoed and bounced off of 
nothingness.&nbsp; Not a single structure stood.&nbsp; Not a single person remained, save 
the man himself.&nbsp; Nothing was there.&nbsp; Life was present in only two forms, the 
man -- from whom it was quickly fleeing -- and a single, lone, speck of a 
sprout, grasping tightly to a now rare earth.&nbsp; A green enduring blemish, upon 
the glorious face of perfection.&nbsp; Though the man offered to share this 
monumental end with the prideful, mocking beginning, as the seconds passed he 
grew to passionately, and quite blatantly, hate the infant bud.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Look around.&nbsp; This is what we had always meant to 
do.&nbsp; This is what we <i>needed</i> to do, and we have -- with impeccable 
precision.&nbsp; From fire to firestorm.&nbsp; From rock to rocket.&nbsp; Out of something -- 
more than our share of something -- we leave nothing.&nbsp; A trillion year evolution 
that ended with a bang!&nbsp; Man was always fascinated by what he couldn't do.&nbsp; 
Every test that was presented, he lived up to.&nbsp; But one thing always remained; 
one thing continuously loomed as a tacit scornful challenge.&nbsp; One thing lingered 
and mocked man's power as an ever-present test: <i>life</i>.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sprout sat attentively, hoping to be forgotten.&nbsp;
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&quot;We've, of course, tried and failed before.&nbsp; Man raped 
nature, but it persevered.&nbsp;&nbsp; Man destroyed millions of his brothers, but left 
barley a scar.&nbsp; Some slaughtered themselves, just to aid the cause.&nbsp; But they 
too left no more than a scratch on the face of billions.&nbsp; But now, <i>now</i> 
we've done it.&nbsp; Life has run its course.&nbsp; Existence has met its match and now, 
now <i>you</i> sit here and mock the greatest feat -- the last feat -- ever to 
be accomplished.&nbsp; Pitiful of you to think I'd die without first finishing the 
job.&nbsp; You'd like to think that I'd let you stay and make us start all over 
again.&nbsp; It's <i>pitiful</i>--&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But his anger only aggravated the inevitable, and his 
coughing projected through the snow of sand and ash.&nbsp; With the last of his life 
nearly gone, he finished a billion year task.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Evolution,&quot; he breathed,&nbsp; &quot;ends here.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plant bent back in fright as a rising wind shook 
its virgin leaflets.&nbsp; The man stared at the sprout with malice and hate.&nbsp; With 
his last reserve of energy, he heaved himself over to his stomach, rolling with 
a cloud of ash.&nbsp; The dust blinded his view and poured into his mouth, choking 
the life from his cold worn body.&nbsp; But when the dust had settled, and death 
retreated for a moment, he saw the sprout slowly appear in front of him, covered 
in the off-white remains of earth.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Trying to hide, are you?&quot;&nbsp; With great effort, he 
extended his arm to the plant, reaching it only with his fingertips.&nbsp; The man 
caressed the leaves carefully, brushing the dust off of its stark green hue.&nbsp;
</font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There you are.&quot;&nbsp; Blood dripped from his smiling lips. 
&quot;You can't fool mankind.&quot;&nbsp; He made a divot in the sand at the base of the stem, 
all that his fleeting energy allowed for him to do.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;My brothers are gone, sisters are dead.&nbsp; Queens and 
kings and presidents - dead.&nbsp; Nations built upon fear and power, the mightiest 
of warriors and strongest of men.&nbsp; Athletes and soldiers and mothers and 
children all dead and gone and fire - and ash.&quot;&nbsp; A single tear disappeared to 
his cheek, burned away through the air by the heat of the sun.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I <i>am </i>mankind, may our race rest in peace!&quot;&nbsp; 
With these words his hand dove deep into the earth, and tore the roots of the 
plant away from their life giving home.&nbsp; He screamed, a loud, wild scream, his 
eyes pulsed and bulged with rage.&nbsp; His hand reemerged with the entire plant 
fasted tightly to its palm, and he threw the sprout far from him, as hard as 
life and death would allow.&nbsp; But with this throw his scream fell short, abrupt; 
final and sharp.&nbsp; The man slumped down to the ashes with a faint wheezing 
cough.&nbsp; Then just a sigh.&nbsp; Then a breath.&nbsp; Then nothing.&nbsp; 
</font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">And the sprout withered in the ruins of an empire, fell 
victim to the sun's cruel ray.&nbsp; The green turned to brown, and soon black as 
night.&nbsp; And the sprout gave in and died.&nbsp; </font> </p>
