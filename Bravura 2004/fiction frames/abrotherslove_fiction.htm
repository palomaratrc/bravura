I turn the volume up on the radio to hear Van Morrison better. It’s hard to hear 
when the desert night air is whipping past your face at eighty miles an hour.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Mom loves this song so much, she used to have me play it for her on my guitar 
all the time when I was a kid , I thought my fingers would bleed from playing it 
over and over again. The dial, covered in sand from the desert breeze, sticks to 
my fingers.&nbsp; Gotta remember to wash my hands. It’s bad enough that the interior 
of Pop’s old ‘65 El Dorado convertible looks like the Sahara from all the dust 
storms, but getting the radio dirty is just uncalled for.&nbsp; If Dad could see his 
baby right now, he’d give me a few lumps, that’s for sure.&nbsp; Dad loved old cars.&nbsp; 
In fact the only thing he loved more than his family was booze and cars.&nbsp; That’s 
how I got my name.&nbsp; Named after the Tucker, or as dad liked to call it “the best 
Goddamn piece of metal to have four wheels slapped on it.” Whatever that meant.&nbsp; 
Jamison, my younger brother, was named after my fathers favorite drink, Jamison 
whiskey. Yup, that’s us. The man and his dream and his favorite drink.</span></font></p>

fishtails as I bring her to a halt.&nbsp; It’s about 2 a.m. on an empty highway, I 
doubt anyone cares if I back up an eighth of a mile. “Milly’s Café. Open 24

Always rubs it in my face how he’s bigger than his older brother.&nbsp; “And how’d 
you get that shiner?”&nbsp; Jamison shoots me a glance that says ‘not funny’, and I 
just give him ahalf-smile.&nbsp; The same smile I give whenever I win.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jamison and 
I always fight about something, and whenever we do, pops puts boxing gloves on 
us and says ‘have at it.’&nbsp; I dunno if he thought we would actually go through 
with it or if he just needed some entertainment after he just slammed down a 
twelve-pack. But we always fought, I always won, and that pisses Jamison off 
more than any argument. </span></font></p>

up the same, except he’s wearing his boxing trunks instead of jeans. So here we 
are again, ready to do what we’ve done a hundred times before.&nbsp; The wind brushes 
against my exposed skin causing goose flesh to burrow up out of the skin of my 
arms. My body gives a quiet tremble but I quickly restrain it. Can’t show any 
sign of weakness to your opponent.&nbsp; I gaze up.&nbsp; The moon looks much bigger than 
it usually does.&nbsp; The lone spectator inches closer to the dance that will take 
place underneath it’s glow.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder what has him so worked up, so I ask.&nbsp; 
“What is it this time, <i>baby</i> brother?&nbsp; Why am I out here freezing my ass 
off when I could be inside all nice and cozy in my bed?” </span></font></p>

out with a right hook like he always does.&nbsp; I block and give him a jab straight 
to the face.&nbsp; A new record: ten seconds into the fight and I already gave him a 
split lip.&nbsp; We dance for what seems like forever.&nbsp; We dance until steam comes 
off our flesh.&nbsp; We dance until we’ve both gotten our licks in.&nbsp; Finally, I give 
him one last jab to the gut and a finishing upper cut.&nbsp; Jamison’s on the ground, 
and all I can think about are my hands.&nbsp; I probably won’t be able to play my 
guitar for at least a week.&nbsp; I help him up and get him inside, and I never ask 
why he is upset.</span></font></p>

I pick up my guitar case...guitar case? I don’t remember bringing it in with

It’s not like I hated him.&nbsp; He was a good father and a good man.&nbsp; He never hit 
my brother or me, not when he was drunk at least.&nbsp; That he left to us.&nbsp; It’s 
just that I didn’t know the man.&nbsp; After seventeen years you think you would know 
someone.&nbsp; I guess that doesn’t apply to family.&nbsp; He was always telling me to pay 
attention, or to forget my dream of playing guitar for a living and focus on a 
real career, yet he had me play for him almost every night.&nbsp; I didn’t know this 
man, and he didn’t know me and yet there’s no doubt in my mind that we loved 
each other.&nbsp; So why aren’t I crying.&nbsp;&nbsp; I glance over at Mother, her face is a 
mess with black mascara tears running down her face.&nbsp; Holding her hand is 
Jamison.&nbsp; Like me, he isn’t crying, but unlike me, he’s visibly holding back.&nbsp; 
It’s taking everything he has not to cry.&nbsp; I study my brother.&nbsp; He spent hours a 
day with my father fixing up that Cadillac which they had just finished a month 
ago.&nbsp; When they were out there I’m sure they talked about anything and 
everything, but about what I’ll never know.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I look at my brother he looks 
as if he’s going to crack, like he can’t hold the tears back anymore, and any 
second now the flood gates will burst open and he won’t be able to stop.&nbsp; He 
glances up at me, and sees that I don’t have a single tear or even a red puffy 
eye.&nbsp; He looks at me, gives me a slight nod, and he doesn’t cry.&nbsp; So why am I 
here?&nbsp; Why did my father have a will?&nbsp; He didn’t have anything of value other 
than the house which he had left to mom, and his car which he had left to me.&nbsp; 
What?! “Excuse me what was that?” </span></font></p>

look I’ve seen one too many times; that look that says “After dad goes to bed 
meet me out back.”&nbsp; It’s night time.&nbsp; Jamison and I meet just like we always do, 
dressed in the same clothes we’re always dressed in,&nbsp; except this time I’m not 
wearing any gloves, and neither is he.&nbsp; I know why we’re here, even if he 
doesn’t know.&nbsp; We both want the same thing, the only tangible piece of our 
father left.&nbsp; He wants it because he feels like he deserves it, because of all 
the work he put into it, and I want it because it’s the only thing he ever gave 
me.&nbsp; He’s mad.&nbsp; He has every right to be, but so am I.&nbsp; Mad that its come to 
this.&nbsp; Mad because the one thing that should bring Jamison and I closer together 
forces us back to the dance.&nbsp; Mad at the man who left us in this position for 
what he has condemned us to.</span></font></p>

blocking it I grab his arm and his left shoulder, and give him a knee straight 
to the gut.&nbsp; Jamison doubles over.&nbsp; “You can’t have it.” I turn and leave him in 
the night gasping for air.&nbsp; I finish up my song just in time as the food 
arrives.&nbsp; My face is covered in tears.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">about two years after dad 
died. He’s a nice enough guy, doesn’t drink, doesn’t spend every waking moment 
in the garage on some heap that he spent half a month’s paycheck on.&nbsp; Mom loves 
him, Jamison hates him, and I’m too drunk to care either way.&nbsp; They say you’re 
fifty percent more likely to be an alcoholic if you’re the son of one.&nbsp; That’s 
the other thing my father left me, the other part of his great legacy.&nbsp; So here 
I am, in some dive bar, where the stench of cigarettes mixes with the vomit on 
the floor, and the crack of the pool balls screams over the blaring&nbsp; jukebox.&nbsp; I 
know everyone’s story because on any night of the week you can find me here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I’m in this joint&nbsp; and in walks my brother.&nbsp; “You’re not allowed to be in here!” 
the bartender barks.&nbsp; </span></font></p>

<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">“It’s ok, Lou.&nbsp; He’s with 
me.” I take a swig of my beer as Jamison seats himself next to me.&nbsp; “C’mon Jami, 
have a drink with your big brother.&nbsp; Lou, two shots of Jamison whiskey!”&nbsp; Lou 
mumbles something about serving a minor, but he gets lost in the noises of the 
bar.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp; “Mom’s worried about you,”

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">Without ever looking up from 
my drink I respond, “Well as you can see I’m just fine.”&nbsp; </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">“Right, because coming home 
blitzed and puking in the closet thinking it’s the john every night is the first 
sign of fine.”&nbsp; </span></font></p>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;“I’m not alone.&nbsp; I got my 
good friends Jack, Jose, and Jamison to keep me company.”&nbsp; I smash my hand down, 
screaming at Lou for those shots. </span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">I cut him off.&nbsp; “He’d be 
proud to see I’m following in his footsteps.” With that I realize that this 
won’t be solved with words, looking up from my drink I see that he feels the 
same way.&nbsp; We step up and head outside to the back alley.&nbsp; The alley is worse 
than the bar, instead of cigarettes and vomit it’s cigarettes and urine.&nbsp; It 
takes everything I have not to waste all that money I dumped inside my body.&nbsp; 
I’m drunk, can’t see straight, I’m not in my right mind, but I still know I can 
kick my brother’s ass.&nbsp; I don’t wait for his right hook.&nbsp; This time I throw the 
first punch.&nbsp; I land the first one square on his jaw, the second on his left 
cheek, the third to his gut, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth.&nbsp; I lose count as 
it turns from a brawl into a beating.&nbsp; Thump.&nbsp; Thump. Thump.&nbsp; I black out.&nbsp; I 
don’t even know what going on and I’m still fighting.&nbsp; When I wake up I’m on top 
of my brother.&nbsp; Is that even him? I don’t even recognize him.&nbsp; Squish. Squish 
Squish.&nbsp; The words ‘son of a bitch’ and ‘he gave you everything’ come out of my 
mouth, but I’m not speaking them. I black out again, this time when I awake I’m 
on the ally floor, a brick with skin and blood on it is lying next to my face, 
and my brother is gone.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">It’s 5 a.m. at Milly’s and my 
heart races, my body shakes, I can hardly hold the burgers and fries down.&nbsp; 
Jamison will be here any minute.&nbsp; As soon as all the swelling went down Jamison 
was out of the house. He drifted around most of Southern California and ended up 
in Vegas.&nbsp; Fixing up cars was his main source of income.&nbsp; Usually he would fix 
up someone’s ride in exchange for food or a place to stay.&nbsp; After a while he 
managed to open up his own shop. We never really spoke about what happened in 
the alley that night, I don’t think either of us really knew why I did what I 
did, so we just left it at that.&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m running all this through my head when in 
he walks.&nbsp; I try to speak, to yell out to him but only a squeak comes out.&nbsp; 
Doesn’t matter.&nbsp; He </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">sees me anyhow.&nbsp; He sits down 
at the table and looks directly at me with our father’s eyes, a large scar just 
above the left one, a little souvenir from the alley fight. We just stare at 
each other for a while; there’s so much I wanna say that won’t come out. ‘I’m 
sorry for turning your face into ground beef’ or ‘I’m sorry for keeping the only 
piece of our father from you.’ but the only thing that comes out is “Did you 
bring your gloves?”&nbsp; He breaks the stare and looks down, giving just a slight 
nod. “All right then. Come with me.”&nbsp; We head outside and hop into the El 
Dorado.&nbsp; I don’t know where I’m going.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">“This looks like shit, 
y’know,” Jamison comments about the car.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">“I know.&nbsp; I never really 
cared to keep it fixed up.” </span></font></p>

<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;“Figures.”&nbsp; I look to the 
east and see that the dark sky has just a tint of blue to it, sunrise won’t be 
long now.&nbsp; After about twenty minutes I pull over and pop the trunk.&nbsp; I reach in 
a grab my gloves, which I bring with me everywhere but haven’t used in years, 
just like the guitar.&nbsp; I pull of my jacket and shirt and I see Jamison do the 
same. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;When we’re ready I tell 
him.&nbsp; “Winner gets the car.” He comes at me, I get ready for his right hook but 
it’s not there.&nbsp; Instead I’m hit by the left, he’s talking as he’s hitting.
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;“Do you really think that’s 
what this is about? The car?”&nbsp; I throw a few punches back and ponder on it.&nbsp; 
Isn’t that what it has always been about? The car he built with our father and I 
wouldn’t let him have.&nbsp; I take the bait. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;“Then what is it? Why don’t 
we get along?”&nbsp;&nbsp; Block. Jab. Block again.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">“Maybe because the last time 
we did this I needed thirty-six stitches put in my face, or maybe because after 
all the work we did together, all he ever did was talk about you and how </span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">proud you made him with your 
guitar playing.” All I’m doing now is blocking; trying to hold back the 
onslaught that will ensue if my defenses are broken “Or maybe, Tucker, just 
maybe it’s because we’re brothers and we’re not supposed to get along. We’re 
just supposed to love each other.”&nbsp; This last comment hits me harder than any 
punch.&nbsp; Was it really that simple?&nbsp; Do we fight because we’re brothers and not 
in spite of it? I drop my defenses for a second and that’s all he needs to get 
in one good blow.&nbsp; I’m on the ground and the fight is over.&nbsp; Jamison has won.&nbsp; 
While I’m down he rips his gloves off, reaches into my pants pocket and takes 
the keys.&nbsp; “Or maybe it is about the car.”&nbsp; He takes off like a bat out of hell, 
leaving me shirtless with only my boxing gloves.&nbsp; I stand up watching him head 
off to the Nevada border.&nbsp; After about a hundred feet he stops and throws 
something on the side of the road.&nbsp;&nbsp; I already know what it is.&nbsp; My guitar 
case.&nbsp; I jog to the case and by the time I get to it he’s long gone.&nbsp; Gone with 
my father’s car, gone with all my burdens and demons.&nbsp; I look out to where he 
had been not five minutes ago and I smile.&nbsp; Jamison, my brother.&nbsp; I may not like 
him but I love him.&nbsp; I begin to walk back towards home trying to hitch a ride.&nbsp; 
As I do I see the sun coming up over the desert.&nbsp; It’s going to be a beautiful 
day.</span></font></p>
