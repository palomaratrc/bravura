the phone and think, this is Life. Everyone is in a hurry; people walking away. 
No one waits.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Mommy, 
wait!</i> I cry to someone in the crowd, a blurred vision of dark hair and dark 
eyes.&nbsp; But the vision blurs away and I am left holding out my trembling hand to 
the Past. But that too is gone, sliding easily away, without a sound.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone 
should write a song about this: “No One Cares For You After Graduation.” I’m a 
full-time college kid with a full-time job, directing one musical while starring 
in a “straight” comedy every weekend. But who are these audience members? And 
then I ask myself, who are <i>you?</i> </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what if 
I’m a full-time college-kid? I don’t even go to a “real”&nbsp; college, as I am 
mockingly reminded of everyday. I’m stuck in a town where everyone knows me and 
forces my life onto display, for their own sport and amusement. My friends are 
all away at “real” college. Sometimes, I wish I was with them. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look out my 
window and try to see them, so far away, and sometimes wish I was with them. 
School colors—black, yellow, and blue; a graciously wide campus—everything so 
white I feel like I’m walking on a china plate at twelve noon.&nbsp; The sea air, 
the pearly-gray sky, the carefully-tended bright flowers and gardens. The 
passing students, all around my age, with heavy backpacks and arms full of 
books, discussing Kandinsky, Dostoevesky, the Beatniks, the newest movie. Eating 
meals in a crowded lunch hall—but laughter—laughter everywhere. Sleeping in a 
dorm with a roommate doing business with her special friend. Alarm clocks, term 
papers, five-hundred students in a class.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, I 
wish for all of that.&nbsp; It was all in my grasp for a few short months.&nbsp; The 
campus was mine; its gleaming sidewalks and rustling flags were the walkway and 
soundtrack of my new life.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stood on 
that campus and <i>felt</i> it for one beautiful day. But I was an interloper. I 
didn’t truly belong. I was the outcast, the oddball, the temperamental actress 
and the insecure artiste.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Time 
passes, supposedly healing the insult of always being ‘the weird one.’&nbsp; I wake 
up one morning to realize that I almost died, but now, there’s no evidence 
except a cut on one hand and the memory forever burned into my soul. So don’t 
worry, Mom and Dad – you needn’t remind me of my mistakes or of my 
phantom-death. I will always remember. I will sit alone in my mind, the candles 
and their shadows making love on the blank walls, and I will remember what it 
feels like to wait for Death. I remember Now.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But then I 
see a small club off the corner of Beverly Hills and Wilshire; I realize that 
there’s music. There’s one song in particular that I hear; soft at first, but 
growing stronger-. My voice struggles through the notes, trying to sing my own 
song against the orchestra, and somehow, everything is bound together with 
effortless color and flow. My child’s song translates into a woman’s song, and 
my ridiculously low alto can still sing with power, no matter what the 
professors near the music offices say – no matter what the <i>critics</i> say.
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as this 
song continues, I see emerald, jade, lime, green – Temecula is in bloom. 
This-this<i> town</i>-this town is my <i>home.</i> Temecula, with its sweeping 
beauty and growing grapes, with its flow of blook-like wine and avarice, with 
its snobbery and small-mindedness-Temecula is my home. I laugh with my 
customers; I take part in another play. I work tirelessly on projects that are 
essentially time capsules of my life. I crash and break and am reborn from my 
ashes. I cry, sweat, bleed, and <i>earn</i> my life. I pass by a quiet 
churchyard with weeping, vigilant trees where a dear friend sleeps. I put on 
another coat of mascara and add another pin to my purse. I drink Thomas Kelper’s 
Orange Soda to toast my quite literary successes. I fight, I feud, I love, I 
hate. I fall apart and somehow put myself back together again.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look around 
at the walls of my chosen room: my yellow walls, my yellow curtains, my yellow 
blankets. Posters on my yellow walls advertise my shows. The pictures are all of 
a happy, smiling Lissa and her friends. And I see a well-worn Bible at the 
nightstand next to a small orange teddy bear and a mug full of pens.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When 
confronted with this yellow vision, I realize that yes, I am grateful for this 
past year and what it has taught me. The Lord had a different path for me.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, goodbye, 
white-edged dream of college life and grown-up freedom. A small school and a 
small town will do for now. In that college-dream, there are no roosters 
ceaselessly crowing near Lot Twelve even when the sun is well up; there is no 
clocktower ringing “Mister Sandman” at exactly four o’clock; there is no theatre 
with a plush-carpeted crawl space that’s excellent for dreaming.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have found 
myself and have really earned my own life.</span></font></p>
