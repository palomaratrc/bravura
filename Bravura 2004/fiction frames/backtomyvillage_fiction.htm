<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 150%">When I stepped off the bus, 
everything was familiar.&nbsp; The dust of the land made me remember the old times 
when the wind blew in my face. The fresh air with dust was something that I 
already knew.&nbsp; It was very different from the place where I live now, but it 
gave me a familiar feeling of being home again.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 150%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was 
walking with my backpack and my luggage to my Mom’s house, I heard people of the 
village saying, “Iso <i>chayamusk’a” or “Iso </i>chayamusian.”<i> </i>I was 
really anxious to talk with them. I was excited to hear the guttural and 
clicking sounds of my native language.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 150%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stopped in 
the middle of the only street in the entire village and looked at all the 
houses. Everything was the same as it was four years ago. The scratched, adobe 
houses were still there. Some of them were falling apart, and the paint on the 
walls was fading or painted over with political signs. As I continued to walk to 
my Mom’s house, I thought how different the streets were. The roads were made of 
rocks not cement like in the United States.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 150%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was at 
the door, I hesitated for a moment. I began to doubt about things like, <i>who 
was going to answer the door? And will my dog recognize me after 4 years?</i> At 
that moment, I saw something at the corner of my left eye. I turn my head and 
saw a bunch of pigs, chickens, and dogs in the distance. They were searching for 
something or maybe it was just customary to gather together in the same area, 
where the village people throw away their trash. Then, I saw her. I saw my thin, 
black dog playing with the other dogs. She was rolling around on the ground and 
covering herself with dirt. I enjoyed watching her. She seemed very happy and 
healthy. She seemed like she didn’t have a care in the world.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 150%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that 
moment, she stood up and looked straight towards the house and realized that 
someone was looking at her. We stared at each other. It was an exciting moment 
for the both of us. I whistle at her like I used to do and she recognized it. 
She left her friends playing and ran excitedly to meet me. She was whining, 
jumping on me, and jumping around with happiness and that made me feel like I 
was back home again.</span></font></p>
