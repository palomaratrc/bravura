<font face="Verdana"><i>I can remember 
losing my eyesight. </i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can remember loosing control of my truck 
on the way home; watching in helpless terror as it suddenly careened off the 
road and down an embankment. I can remember it slamming into an old oak tree 
with indescribable violence. </font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I never hit the windshield because all of 
the windows in the truck actually imploded when it crashed into the tree. The 
sudden, sparkling tempest of broken glass blew into the car, shards of glass 
flew through the air like bullets, piercing through my skin, ripping through my 
clothes. My face got it the worst. The glass tore through my cheeks, my nose, my 
eyelids. I can remember throwing my arms up to cover my face just before I was 
thrown out of the truck. </font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never really had time to react. The 
sudden shock of my injuries was followed by an almost eerily quiet journey 
through the air. I was surrounded by the slow, ambient sounds of nature as I 
drifted through time and space. All this peacefulness was unceremoniously 
interrupted when my body was suddenly dashed against the ground. Everything went 
totally black for the first time in my life.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I awoke to the feeling of cold stream water 
running over me. I remember my ruined eyes opening for the first time, looking 
up to the sound of leaves above me and seeing nothing but darkness. No colors, 
not even any lights, just absolute, <i>fucking</i>, darkness. The horrible 
realization that I was now blind made me so angry that I forgot that I was 
dying, bleeding to death in a fucking creek out in the woods. Feeling my life 
drain out into the running water was suddenly meaningless to me. I didn’t care 
if I died. <i>How could this have happened to me</i>? I thought as I closed my 
eyes, feeling tired as the anemic sensation of my massive blood-loss lulled me 
into a dreamless sleep.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center">
<font face="Verdana">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the story goes; I was discovered some 
hours later-several feet away from the crash site. They took me back to a 
hospital, where I spent what seemed like an eternity. I remember when the 
doctors told me that I would never see again. At that point it didn’t matter, I 
already knew that I wouldn't. They eventually had to take my eyes because of 
infection. It was horrible.....It was like hell. </font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People tried their best to cheer me up. My 
brother paid me weekly visits and the hospital staff was very kind and cordial 
to me. I’m sure that some of the nurses must've been pretty. Of course none of 
that mattered then, all of those people, all of those “heartfelt” conversations, 
all of those pretty, invisible nurses, were lost to me; <i>sounds</i> and <i>
pictures</i> in an abysmal darkness that never lifted. Things would never be the 
same.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was finally released, my brother 
drove me back home. I was set up in a cabin that was way out in the woods.&nbsp; I 
had just finished building it a few months before my crash. It was isolated, and 
I was thankful for that. I just wanted to be alone. In the past, I had found 
true peace and happiness in solitude; maybe it was what I needed now. I smiled 
when I remembered that not far away from the cabin was a lake where I used to 
catch fish. </font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fishing was something I really enjoyed.&nbsp; 
Just being there, out in nature; it was absolutely nourishing to my soul. I 
remember sitting on the shore with my rod and tackle box, my line in the water, 
just looking up at the trees. I would sit there for hours, watching the wind 
gently caress the branches that hung overhead. I would look out over the water, 
watching tiny clouds of gnats swarming on the surface, moving lazily over the 
ripples that ran peacefully over the deep, murky lake. Every now and then a fish 
would pop up to grab a few of them, before splashing back down into the lake. I 
would watch in almost </font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">slow motion, as a fish would emerge from the water, the 
white, perfect sunlight hitting each scale on it’s body in a prism sunburst of 
color that reflected back into my captivated eyes. I would watch the brilliant 
colors slowly dissipate into the water as the fish dove back down into the deep.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of these fond memories I felt, would 
never be revisited. My ruined eyes would never see these things again. Not being 
able to see I believed, was something I would never truly adjust to. I felt 
positively worthless; unable to enjoy the things I once took for granted.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, my brother stayed and took care 
of me. I did my best to try and talk him out of it but he wouldn’t listen to me. 
I really didn’t need his help. Even so, he did his best to try and help me 
adjust to living without my eyesight. Those days were very difficult, listless 
days.&nbsp; I spent much of my time sitting around the house, “watching” televison 
and listening to the radio.&nbsp; My brother would sometimes offer to take me 
fishing, but I always told him I didn‘t want to. I was convinced that it would 
have been too unbearable to endure the disappointment. I felt that it was all 
better left as a memory.&nbsp; </font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As time wore on, I became more difficult to 
live with. My brother finally gave up </font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">hope for me and moved out. Despite his sincerest efforts I 
just became more angry and hateful towards everything; especially him. I hated 
the fact that he made me feel like some kid, incapable of living on my own. 
Things became more and more tense between us until they reached an almost 
unavoidable outcome: I attacked my brother. All of my rage and bitterness at 
losing my eyesight, I took out on him in that one moment. My fists swung through 
the air, pummeling his face as he lay helpless, pinned beneath me. I can still 
remember feeling the warm wetness of blood and saliva on my fists, and the 
defeated, frantic cries to “stop” as I beat him relentlessly.&nbsp; When it was all 
over, he ran out of the house and never came back. All he left behind was the 
sound of screeching truck tires as he pealed out of the driveway. I never heard 
from him again. His departure left me completely alone. Although eventually I 
would come to regret what I had done that night, I was finally given what I 
wanted; Solitude.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Months went by, and I slowly became more 
adjusted to living by myself. I was still angry,&nbsp; still wrought with the feeling 
of being cheated by life, but at least I was capable. I learned to make better 
use of my residual senses to do the things my brother used to do for me, wash 
dishes, turn on the radio, even get firewood. I started to think that I never 
really needed his help. For a while it was great, but unfortunately, it didn’t 
last long.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Although I was temporarily satisfied with 
my life, I quickly discovered that the comfort was fleeting. My newfound 
confidence and contentment was overshadowed by alarming visions of the future. I 
had recurring nightmares of dying alone out in the cabin, my body left 
neglected, consumed by time and vermin. Every time I would awake, covered in 
cold sweat, shivering from the visceral fear. The thought of living the rest of 
my life alone, out in the woods, had lost much of its former appeal. I was 
beginning to feel trapped, like there was nothing I could do to save myself.&nbsp; 
Hopelessness and misery loomed over me like a dark cloud, tickling my mind with 
thoughts of dread and suicide. In the blind darkness I could see my own gray, 
decayed skull, grinning sadistically at me as I lay alone in my bed. One way or 
another I thought, I needed an escape from my problems. </font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I laid awake in bed for hours that night.&nbsp; 
I couldn’t bring myself to face those horrible visions again. As I laid on my 
back with my empty eyes staring up at the ceiling,</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">I started to think about fishing, and how my brother always 
wanted to take me. </font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remembered that although each time I 
declined my brother’s repeated offers to take me fishing, there was always a 
part of me that wanted to accept them. Deep down I really did miss the simple 
pleasure that was once so important to me. As I laid there in bed thinking, I 
realized that very little about me had changed. I felt that if there was any 
hope for me to enjoy something, it would have to be fishing. I decided then that 
after a few days of planning and preparation, I would try fishing again. </font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center">
<font face="Verdana">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One morning, I woke up, got my rod and 
tackle box from my closet, and headed out the door of the cabin. I had my doubts 
of how successful my venture was going to be, but I tried to remain upbeat. I 
remembered that before I built my home, I had also built a little wooden fence 
that stood about waist high, and ran all the way out to the lake. I figured that 
I would use it as a guide. All I had to do was keep my hand on the railing until 
it ended, and then walk a short distance to the lake shore. <i>This should be 
easy</i>, I tried to tell myself.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I walked slowly toward the fence, 
carefully moving my hand to grasp the railing. My mind’s eye perception of the 
fence shifted as I felt how old and rickety it had become. I worried that it 
might be broken further down, but I quickly dismissed the notion. I stood there 
a while before I started walking along, keeping my hand fixed on the railing. I 
kept moving, listening to the scrape of my boots against the dirt path as I 
walked onward toward the lake. </font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center">
<font face="Verdana">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When my hand slid off the end of the 
railing I felt relieved. It appeared that I had finally arrived at the lake. 
With my fishing rod in my outstretched hand , I gently brushed at the empty 
space ahead of me as I moved forward. The sound of leaves and twigs crunching 
softly beneath my careful steps sounded from below. I heard a strange sound as 
the tip of my fishing rod slipped into the mushy lake shore. I stopped for a 
moment and stepped back a bit to find a good place to set up my stuff. I set 
down my fishing rod, feeling the end for my line, and grabbed it up. Opening my 
tackle box, I reached inside to remove a small jar that I had filled with 
earthworms the night before. I pulled out a worm, feeling it writhe and struggle 
aggressively in my fingers as I carefully impaled it on the hook before letting 
it go. I felt the weight of it as it swung away from me. Holding the fishing 
rod, I could hear the sound of the worm thrashing softly, and feel the vibration 
of it’s continuous struggle with reality.&nbsp; Without any hesitation, I cast my 
line out into the water, listening as the worm and hook splashed through the 
surface of the lake.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sitting for hours on the edge of that 
lake I began to feel better. I could feel the warmth of the sun on my skin, and 
the comforting chill of the breeze on my face, I could hear the sound of the 
leaves in the trees rustling softly overhead, and the sound of birds chirping 
off in the distance. I could smell the soft soil, the fresh pine trees and the 
invigorating smell of the water. </font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was once more, a beautiful place. 
Closing my ruined eyelids for a moment, I suddenly understood.&nbsp; I didn’t need <i>
eyes</i> to experience what this place had to offer. Being blind didn’t make my 
life as irrelevant as I believed it would be. </font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a bittersweet realization. I was 
right, I really <i>didn’t </i>need anyone’s help to be where I was on that day. 
What killed me was how much time I had wasted lamenting the fact that I was 
blind.&nbsp; My own self pity had been tremendously costly for me, and it was at that 
moment that I realized just how stupid I had been. </font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My thoughtful meditation was suddenly 
interrupted by a tug on my fishing line. Below the surface of the lake, I could 
feel a fish anxiously nibbling on the bait. Shaken from my quiet reverie I 
straightened myself and leaned closer to the edge of the lake, reaching for the 
reel with one hand, and steadying my fishing rod with the other. Very suddenly, 
and very quickly I jerked the fishing rod back, smiling knowingly as I felt the 
line suddenly snap taught.&nbsp; The creature below the surface of the lake had begun 
it’s struggle with a blind fisherman.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I pulled back the rod as I reeled in what 
felt like a brick at the end of the line. The fish was no doubt very large, but 
I was way too determined to let it get the best of me.&nbsp; I felt the line grow 
tighter, and I knew I had the fish in close. The sound of a huge splash only a 
few feet in front of me only confirmed my suspicion. Sitting on the shore, I 
began to excitedly reel in my catch, listening to the frantic sounds of&nbsp; the 
fish convulsing wildly in the water. With one final pull, I felt the monster 
leap out of the muck at the edge of the lake, and land right in my lap, 
spattering mud all over my face.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sudden weight dropping onto me along 
with the cool spray of lake mud on my face was startling, and it caused me to 
jump. The fish just lay there in my lap breathing, its’ gills opening and 
closing very slowly as it lay prone in my lap. I slowly set down my fishing rod 
and reached my hands down toward it. The monster didn’t struggle as I felt its 
cold, scaled body. The fish was huge, I could feel its wet scales warming as it 
lay in the sunlight. With my eyes still closed I slowly ran my hands up to the 
mouth of the fish. Its maw continuously gaped and then sealed itself shut in a 
seemingly never-ending cycle.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I felt the hook in its mouth, the metal 
suddenly feeling cold and harsh in my fingers. As I carefully removed the hook, 
the monster began to protest me, moving around as if to warn against any further 
interference. I softly laid my hand on the fish’s head and held it there for a 
moment, before slowly getting up. As I stood, I shifted the fish into the crook 
of my arm and walked towards the edge of the lake. </font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew I had neared the edge when the fish 
began to thrash aggressively. Removing it from the crook of my arm with both 
hands, I carefully lowered the fish into the lake. Smiling softly as I felt it 
swim out of my hands and into the water, its tail gently caressing my hand in 
one quick swipe as it swam away, seemingly oblivious of its’ strange benefactor.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still grinning at my achievement, I stepped 
carefully backward to my blanket on the shore, turning to face the lake as I sat 
back down. I had kept my eyes closed through the whole ordeal. I sat for a 
moment and waited until my smile faded away. Then I opened my eyes. </font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun shone in brilliant oranges and 
yellows as it began to set in the sky. Light shimmered on the perfect surface of 
the lake as the reflection of the sunlight lanced out. The trees shifted in the 
soft breeze, their leaves lightly rustled as the wind moved along. I looked out 
over the water, watching a tiny gray cloud of gnats swarm on the surface, moving 
lazily over the ripples on the lake.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I watched as the fish leapt out from the 
center of the lake. It’s mouth opened wide, ready to consume the swarming gnats 
that floated just above the surface of the water. It’s wet scales shimmered in 
the sunlight as it emerged from the lake. It caught a mouthful of gnats and then 
began to fall back towards the surface, its slow decent happening almost outside 
of time. </font> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat watching as the brilliant light and 
color slowly began to dissipate into the water. I watched as each shining scale 
was eclipsed by the surface of the lake. I watched everything around me slowly 
fade away, into darkness.</font></p>
