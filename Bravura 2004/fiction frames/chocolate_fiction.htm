<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My 
grandfather had a special place in his house.&nbsp; It was his big leather recliner 
with a side table.&nbsp; Anything on that table was his and only his.&nbsp; The top shelf 
was not interesting at all.&nbsp; There was a glass ash tray overflowing with butts 
and ashes and usually a newspaper folded in half lengthwise and tossed 
haphazardly against a cut crystal lamp.&nbsp; But the lower shelf had the treasure.&nbsp; 
This was hard to take for a young child: he kept <i>at least one</i> of those 
huge one pound Hershey’s chocolate bars.&nbsp; I don’t remember being told they were 
his, but I was so sure about that fact that I never even thought about asking 
for any.&nbsp; My grandmother made up for this by having a candy dish full of goodies 
we could have.&nbsp; It was a system that kept everyone happy, more or less.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother 
kept up the forbidden Hershey treasure tradition.&nbsp; She had the smaller bars, the 
ones that had H-E-R-S-H-E-Y spelled out on the surface of the chocolate.&nbsp; Her 
six packs were hidden behind the dinner dishes in the cupboard above the kitchen 
counter.&nbsp; I knew her spot and I learned I could sneak one candy bar, just so 
long as it wasn’t the last one, and she never seemed to notice.&nbsp; By age eight I 
was very good at vaulting up onto the counter, landing on my knees, and getting 
behind those dishes.&nbsp; </span></font></p>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Unfortunately, I have not been able to continue the tradition.&nbsp; I had one of 
those odd pregnancy changes.&nbsp; Some women get curly hair where it had always been 
straight, others grow stronger nails, some just get stretch marks.&nbsp; I developed 
an allergic reaction to chocolate.&nbsp; Ever since my daughter was born, I get 
migraine headaches from chocolate.&nbsp; But I have strong memories.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sad to 
say that my daughter didn’t get to meet the grandfather I grew up with.&nbsp; Oh, she 
met him, but he was no longer himself.&nbsp; He developed Alzheimer’s by the time she 
was a year old.&nbsp; When she was three, his wild gray hair and eyebrows made him 
look like a scary Albert Einstein.&nbsp; One Christmas day at my mother’s house, my 
daughter and her cousin held hands and walked up to him and bravely shouted in 
unison, “You can’t scare us!&nbsp; It’s not OK!”&nbsp; Then they ran upstairs to the 
playroom as fast as they could.&nbsp; My mom stopped bringing him over on Christmas 
after that.&nbsp; She was afraid the kids would be traumatized.&nbsp; I couldn’t 
understand that.&nbsp; I still saw my funny grandpa, just more worn out and 
understandably annoyed by the squealing little kids.&nbsp; I still loved him being 
with us.&nbsp; I had all the patience in the world for the fishing story he would 
repeat ten times in one afternoon.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few years 
later, I had a very vivid dream.&nbsp; I dreamt that my grandfather had come to visit 
me at my new house.&nbsp; He had never really been there before.&nbsp; In the dream, we 
talked like we did long ago sitting on a worn wooden bench in his long narrow 
garden with a goldfish pond in the center of the lawn and beautiful blooms 
weighing heavily on shrubs all around the perimeter of the yard in San 
Francisco.&nbsp; Not one bit of his story telling was repetitious.&nbsp; He pretended I 
was a little girl again and he clicked his nails in my ear like his used to do, 
saying, “It’s little buggies in your ear.&nbsp; Hear them?”&nbsp; I laughed and held his 
big, rough hand covered with age spots and wiry hair as I pulled him away from 
my ear.&nbsp; Then he gave me part of his one pound Hershey bar.&nbsp; I felt like he had 
just given me a diamond necklace.&nbsp; I gasped quickly in, and slowly out, as I 
felt the heavy weight of the honor sitting high on my chest.&nbsp; We both ate the 
chocolate and smiled great, big happy smiles.&nbsp; And I felt warm. </span>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I woke up in 
the morning with a migraine.&nbsp; It was worse than usual.&nbsp; I asked my husband to 
bring me my pills and some water, then I told him about the dream.&nbsp; I was 
pressing my left temple while I chuckled.&nbsp; I stayed in bed for a couple of 
hours, waiting for the pain to subside.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">Just as I was ready to get 
up, the phone rang.&nbsp; It was my mother.&nbsp; My grandfather had died in the night.&nbsp; 
Peacefully, on the leather recliner in front of the TV.&nbsp; I imagine they found 
him smiling on the chair with a big Hershey wrapper on his lap.&nbsp; And I was 
grateful that he had come to say goodbye to me.</span></font></p>
