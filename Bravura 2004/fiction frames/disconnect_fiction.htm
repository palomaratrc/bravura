the baby’s room to escape him, her face flushed with anger.&nbsp; After five years of 
marriage, she thought she should know when to expect his outbursts.&nbsp; But she 
didn’t.&nbsp; They blindsided her again and again as she held out hope for calm and 
happiness.&nbsp; Once in the room she held the baby tightly against her cheek as 
tears came slowly, silently.&nbsp; She rocked the baby a long while until her tears 
subsided.&nbsp; Then she forced him out of her mind and concentrated on being 
cheerful with her daughter.&nbsp; </span></font></p>

little miss?&nbsp; What a nice big smile you have for me.”&nbsp; She continued to talk 
gently to the burbling little girl as she rocked her in the rocker covered with 
a fuzzy pink and white blanket.&nbsp; Ann picked up the Picasso book her sister had 
given them.&nbsp; Aunt Sue wanted the baby to learn the arts early. </span>

spent in tense silence.&nbsp; Several times Ann thought of something nice to talk 
about, but as soon as she turned toward him she saw his face was a mass of tight 
wrinkles and his eyes seethed hatred.&nbsp; She realized he intended to prolong his 
anger as if it were his salvation.&nbsp; <i>He’ll just bite my head off.&nbsp; I need to 
lay low and hope he doesn’t blow up at me.</i></span></font></p>

it was just the smallest click that woke her up.&nbsp; She tip toed to the bedroom 
door and turned the knob very slowly, willing it not to squeak.&nbsp; Shivering in 
her thin silky gown, her fingers white with cold, she turned to carefully close 
the door with no more than a soft thump as the door made contact with the 
frame.&nbsp; Before going into the hall bath for her shower, she tipped her head into 
the baby’s room and saw her sleeping chubby face, mouth agape, between the 
glossy white slats of the crib.&nbsp; Ann’s unconscious smile made her shoulders 
relax and slide down her back.&nbsp; Then she locked the bathroom door and took a 
very hot shower.</span></font></p>

carefully laid a towel flat across the counter top.&nbsp; Onto the towel went her 
toothbrush, toothpaste, hairbrush, can of mousse, moisturizer and make-up.&nbsp; Each 
movement to pick up or put down an item was very deliberate.&nbsp; She wiped a circle 
of steam off the mirror with a dry washcloth and looked at herself through the 
insistent droplets of water clinging to the glass.&nbsp; <i>What am I doing?&nbsp; This is 
a crazy way to live.&nbsp; I keep expecting him to have a good day again, but he 
never does.</i>&nbsp; Occasionally she stopped and put her ear near the door to see 
if he was moving around.&nbsp;&nbsp; “Oh shit!”&nbsp; She dropped the can of mousse onto the 
tile floor.&nbsp; Her hands instinctively went to cover her face while the muscles 
across the back of her shoulders cinched up, her elbows tucked in, even her 
thighs tensed up.&nbsp; She squeezed her eyes tight, held her breath and listened.&nbsp;
<i>No I don’t think he heard that.&nbsp; I’m ok.</i></span></font></p>

frozen in place two steps behind Kurt.&nbsp; Her hands locked over her mouth as she 
stared at her little girl crying on the carpet.&nbsp; She was nauseous from the 
adrenaline pounding through her veins.&nbsp; <i>Oh my God.&nbsp; Now he’s started on her, 
too.&nbsp; Why can’t I go to her?&nbsp; This is bad.&nbsp; Very bad.&nbsp; I have to get her away

slipped down her cheeks as she walked into the kitchen and settled the baby in 
the highchair with crackers.&nbsp; <i>At least he doesn’t hit us.</i>&nbsp; Ann gripped 
the edge of the counter with one hand and clasped the other over her dry lips.&nbsp; 
She didn’t breathe for a long minute, holding back the flood of emotion stifled 
inside.&nbsp; <i>Damn him.&nbsp; Anxiety this extreme? He’s nuts.&nbsp; Mentally ill!&nbsp; I have 
to leave.&nbsp; But I can’t kick a dog when he’s down.&nbsp; I’ll have to stay until he’s 
better.&nbsp; Who am I kidding?&nbsp; He may never be better!&nbsp; If he was better, then we 
could have a good life.&nbsp; I don’t know what to do, but I can’t leave right now.

Stoneridge Plaza with Sydney Shore.”&nbsp; Her insides felt like quivering jelly.&nbsp; 
Very much aware that he was watching her, she held herself tall and walked 
stiffly down the hall.&nbsp; She spent the night with the baby in the nursery.&nbsp; He 
didn’t say another word about the appointment, or anything else that night.</span></font></p>

comfortable with its soft orange glow of light, thick brown carpet, and coarsely 
textured grass wallpaper.&nbsp; Ann chose a stiff chair next to the door, leaving the 
over stuffed loveseat empty.&nbsp; There was a large print of Picasso’s <i>Nude Woman

shadows.&nbsp; Just then, Ann realized why she was there and felt whole for the first 
time in a long while.</span></font></p>
