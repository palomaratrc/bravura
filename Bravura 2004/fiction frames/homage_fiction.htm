“Sheila, she’s dead.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">

“You’re kidding!” I knew who the ‘she’ was. I recognized Jill’s husky voice 
immediately. My co-worker from fifteen years ago wouldn’t have thought to call 
me for any other reason. Our former employer, The Boss, had died of a heart 
attack at sixty. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“There’s a memorial at that little church on Bird’s Eye Road in Palos Verdes, 
next Friday. Come on up, why don’t you?”&nbsp; Her voice brightened. “A lot of our 
old friends, people we worked with, will be there. Brian’s preparing a eulogy. 
Maybe you’ll speak, too?”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Of course I will,” I said.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
didn’t much care for funerals. But this one commemorated the life of a woman 
who’d shaped mine. During the three hour drive from San Diego 
to Los Angeles, I rehearsed what I would say all the way.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I 
got there early. A trait she instilled in us. Be prepared and be on time. It was 
one of her success tactics, she said it often.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Sunlight streamed through a stain glass window of the church overlooking the
Pacific 
Ocean. It 
tinted the mourners faces like fractured images in a kaleidoscope. Salt breezes 
coursed through the open doors lifting the cloying scent of funeral wreaths up 
into the recesses of the balcony.&nbsp; 
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Sitting in the front of the chapel seemed like a good idea. She always told us 
successful people sat in the first row. Another tactic. Another suggestion that 
over time became part of her teaching intoned like a mantra we couldn’t forget.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We 
became successful, too. Respected print production managers at advertising 
agencies from San Diego to San Francisco. Some of her former assistants own 
their own graphic design businesses, some are principals in printing companies, 
others are vice presidents in international advertising agencies. I ultimately 
became a writer.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Jill slid into the pew beside me with a smile of welcome, then a hug and quick 
kiss on each cheek.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“You look great,” I said, meaning it. Jill was younger than me. She’d never 
married and spent her money on keeping herself fit and attractive. She owned a 
graphics company in Hollywood whose clients were movie studios. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“You do too,” she replied. “Writing must be good for you. The stress lines are 
gone from your face.” &nbsp;She looked at me carefully. “I’m sorry I haven’t called 
you.”&nbsp; I remembered that we’d once been great friends.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Me, too,”&nbsp; I said. Why do I let friendships wither away? Maybe because my 
writer’s existence isn’t interesting to outsiders or because my needs are met. 
I’ve been married for years to an artist who fills my life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Former coworkers and old friends from Los Angeles advertising companies crowded 
into our pew beside us, leaning close to whisper hello. As the murmur of voices 
swelled to announce arriving mourners behind me, I found myself turning often to 
look for a familiar face. There were many. Not as many as I thought would be 
there to honor this woman, but as they filed in, some with faces older than I 
recalled, I tried hard not to smile and wave. Bittersweet, that this unexpected 
somber event would gather these people to her side in death, when making the 
effort to get together while she lived was so complicated. While this woman had 
launched our careers in advertising print production, many of us forgot her and 
each other as we grew successful. Still, her stern training, patient nurturing, 
forgiving nature and zest for work were part of what we became. We’d come to 
this memorial for what she’d taught us, as much as for the woman herself. </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
sat there fidgeting with the printed funeral program. On its two pages a woman’s 
existence had been defined in small black type. How could a woman whose 
eccentric influence spanned sixty years and touched the lives of so many people, 
be distilled into so few words?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
was her first assistant and she was The Boss. She gave me my break, put up with 
a lot from me. Back then, I was young, single, mini-skirted and cocky. She was 
older, </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">single too, and 
dowdy but supremely confident. She told me once why she had chosen </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">career over 
marriage. A simple story. Nothing more than a broken heart. To me it seemed 
trivial at a time when my boyfriends were plentiful. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Looking back, I know what a life-changing choice it was for her. Careers meant 
everything for a woman in the 1970s, the era when women's liberation became a 
reality. At the peak of her career, she managed seven of us hormonally charged 
females, keeping a tight rein on our outbursts of authority, always training, 
teaching and taking the brunt of our mistakes.&nbsp; For eight years she took me 
under her wing, and when I left her side, brashly taking my first job as The 
Boss, she launched my career with a party and warm recognition. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Two years later, when my new job dwindled to nothing, she welcomed me back. 
Gratefully returning with more experience, and much wiser, I humbly accepted 
with maturity those backward steps as career progress.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
stayed with her until the company unexpectedly closed its doors three years 
later, and like baby birds launched into flight, she pushed us all out of the 
nest to find careers on our own. Bursting with courage and apprehension, we 
scattered into the Los Angeles ad community, all of us ready to become The Boss 
ourselves. Skilled, responsible, good managers, trained by the best. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My 
path crossed hers over the years, at meetings, conferences, social gatherings 
and reunions. We chatted a bit, caught up on gossip, then slowly lost touch with 
each other. A phone call could have made the difference, but our careers were 
too consuming to keep the friendship vital. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
didn’t forget her, though. Because her influence was reflected in everything I 
did, the good and the bad; the tenacity and insecurity. My reach for perfection 
and stubborn fight to be accurate in all things. Stamina to push through long 
hours and cruel bouts of fatigue. Whatever I had become, she was responsible. 
And, though I always gave her credit for my training, I don’t know if that 
credit extended to my successes, too. Those slivers of limelight were too narrow 
for women then. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
When I learned of her death, ten years had passed since we’d spoken and I 
couldn’t remember thanking her enough. Now it was too late. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I 
sat motionless while old pal Brian spoke his simple eulogy. Tears filled my eyes 
as he quietly described her contributions, her achievements. Then it was time 
for me to step forward and immortalize this woman who had influenced my life so 
dramatically. But I was unable to move from the pew, my mind crowded with 
memories, emotion making me vulnerable and fragile. My comments seemed too 
personal to relate, my thoughts too intimate. My carefully rehearsed words of 
remembrance slipped away, like ephemeral dust motes disappearing amongst the 
shafts of light streaming through the church windows. Lost in a gray tangle of 
thought, I startled as a sobbing family member rose to signal the end of the 
service. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I 
thought you were going to get up there and say something,” Jill said, looking at 
me curiously. “You always told me how much she meant to you.” </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I 
couldn’t stand up,” I said. “No matter how I phrased them in my head, none of 
the words that came to mind were equal to what I felt.”&nbsp; I could feel the tears 
welling up again. Jill handed me a Kleenex. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Yeah, I know,” she said, then put her arm around my shoulders and hugged me.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 24.0pt">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As 
Jill and I joined the other mourners crowding the walkway outside, the years of 
neglected friendships slipped away. Smiles of recognition freshened by the 
memory of this woman we’d lost brightened conversations and made the moment 
lighter. Yet, when plans for the wake and the easy details of directions and car 
pooling reached me, my uplifted mood faded like the brightness of a window 
shuttered against the sun. Suddenly longing for the comfort of my life in San 
Diego, I jotted down new addresses and phone numbers, promising to keep in 
touch, and as I started toward the parking lot, vowed to do just that. I waved 
goodbye across the crowd to Jill who was talking animatedly with a printing 
salesman I vaguely remembered.&nbsp; She turned her face to smile in my direction 
then mouthed the words, “I’ll call you.”&nbsp; She never did.</span></p>
