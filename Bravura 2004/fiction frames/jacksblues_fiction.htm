The musician put the clarinet to his lips, eyes focused in the distance, &nbsp;as the 
music begins unobtrusively, then glides down the scale softly in slow motion 
like riffles in a stream, deliberate and voluptuous, creating a mood for the 
other musicians. Leaning into the jazz club crowd with a growl in the lowest 
register he invites them to listen; to experience the real thing; to <i>know </i>
the blues; to momentarily&nbsp; &nbsp;re-experience memories of the good and the bad, the 
sadness, the hurt of loss and the nostalgia for the romanticized past. The music 
reveals the truth to the careful listener, as it converses in the down and dirty 
low notes of seduction, the rubenesque tones of the middle keys that trigger 
memories of a passionate long ago love, the smeared sad B-flat sound of the lost 
past, or the high-pitched woodwind screams of anger and frustration. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">

The chatter of the crowd is gradually subdued by the subtle insistence of the 
music. One by one, the attention of each person in the room is lured to the 
blues. The musicians carefully select each note, develop each chord, compose 
each phrase with an unspoken, inarticulate, but understood message; a developed 
improvisation which slowly reveals a growing intensity, providing each listener 
his own understanding. Now the blues build and build some more, crying out, 
preaching the gospel of the sacred and the profane, the beautiful and the ugly, 
the virginal and the orgiastic. The music moves like a tide over the range of 
the instruments, exploring the topography of grief, slurring the half tones of 
sadness, moaning in the lust of the lower register, smirking, then flirting, 
then growing serious in the dance of love, ending in a sigh of ecstasy.</span></p>

The audience is excited, intense and receptive. Intimacy and understanding of a 
language more eloquent than articulate speech engulf them. They share the 
musician’s pain, grief and ecstasy in a way more intense, more real than any 
expression communicated by mouth or pen. They listen with a musician’s ear and 
experience the truth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%; font-family: Verdana">
Out of the acrid veil of cigarette smoke two young women come to the dance 
floor, rising to the challenge of the music, to prove that dance is an even more 
fervent communicator of the truth than music. Tall and slim, one woman has a 
masculine assurance about her, an intense focus, and a way of moving that is 
cat-like and sensuous. Her partner’s seductive saunter and manner suggests an 
aggressive sexuality.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%; font-family: Verdana">
Their eyes are fixed on each other. Their hip-rolling and weaving with a 
sensuous carefree don’t-give-a-damn attitude invites the musicians to back them 
up. The clarinet man smiles knowingly, takes up the instrument to tell the 
story, beginning with a lower register growl that grows in volume, followed by a 
smeared crescendo to the top, and then plunges to the bottom of the range in a 
lascivious salute to the pair on the floor. And so, the dance of love begins 
once more..</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%; font-family: Verdana">
The women face each other, hands on each other’s hips, seductively dancing from 
side to side, eyelids half closed in sensual recognition, locked in the embrace 
of the music. The clarinetist slides his fingers over the keys with a feather 
touch, the instrument responds in luxurious tones, rich in feeling, zaftig to 
the ear, then moves on to the voluptuous feel of the lower register, 
instinctive, stalking, provocative and inviting. The attention of the audience 
is riveted on the two women; excited by the music; intoxicated by a combination 
of alcohol and anticipation; they come to the dance floor encircling &nbsp;the women 
to get closer to the heat. The women respond in kind, generating greater and 
greater passion as their improvised dance becomes more and more sensual, then 
wanton, and finally both musicians and dancers collapse in the climax of their 
mutual dance of love.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%; font-family: Verdana">
The audience melts back into the shadows while the dancers, hand in hand, 
quietly slip out the front door of the bar with expressions on their faces that 
suggest a firmness of purpose for the balance of this night; and the clarinet 
player turns away with a smile of satisfaction and begins the intro to the next 
selection of the blues.</span></p>
