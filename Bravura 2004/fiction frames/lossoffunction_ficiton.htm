You, my dear, are suffering from schizophrenia. That is to say, you have a
psychotic disorder characterized by loss of contact with the environment, by
noticeable deterioration in the level of functioning in everyday life, and by
disintegration of personality expressed as disorder of feeling (as in 
hallucinations
and delusions) and conduct- also known as dementia praecox. Denial is futile
when detailing instances occupying the brain. No matter how you try to rectify
this particular situation, the absolute certainty of its existence is 
irrefutable. Are
you listening? No, this can not be written off as another one of your so-called
voices. Pathetic attempts at puppy-dog faces and duck mouths will not change the
judgment so meticulously laid upon your shoulders. Derangement is yours to
endure. As a matter of fact, embrace it! Your diagnosis is complete. Now go live
with romantic fervor and throw caution to the wind. You nut.</span></p>

This is what your parents pay to give you in the course of biweekly
encounters from someone whose services you overheard them referring to as
&quot;cheap.&quot; Frugal psychiatry? The certificates encased by splintered frames are no
more than smeared copies! Is that white-out on the second line? You stake your
life on the fact that this guy is a well trained con-artist specializing in the
misfortune of small-framed girls with parents searching for answers as to why
their child is just so different. </span></p>

Among a slew of parentally sanctioned parasites is a red and yellow 57.5 mg
capsule that you call Ezekial Winthorpe. He slides down your throat in a wave of
milk, skilled in the trickery of eyelids fluttering shut for sleep. First you 
must
complete a prayer to whom you are taught is your heavenly father, Mr. Jesus
Christ. As if one oppressive father weren't enough. Your inquiries regarding 
this
implausible fellow are met with a scornful glare and furrowed brow. You are
forbidden to question in reference of anything, especially religion. Upon
awakening from induced near coma, a blue and green 150 mg adventure waits
patiently in the plastic compartment labeled MORNING. Gustavo the Pirate, most
affectionately named, engages you in hours of deep, inner bliss. He shuts the 
rest
of the universe out, and you up. This is the time you spend cast into 
translation.
Naturally, Gustavo the Pirate is a favorite of your parents as well. </span></p>

You are merely eight years old. Your chin length black hair in the form of
what hairstylists refer to as &quot;bob&quot; hangs around your delicate face like all the
emotions swallowing your stomach on a daily basis. This is not the age to be
discussing your conception of reality with a contemptuous ego maniac. It is the
time to spend watching your freckles. You gain fulfillment in playing connect 
the
dots with these ghostly kisses spotting your pale naked skin. Until, of course, 
the
game is interrupted by eruption of their uncharacteristic choreography. Tango?
No. Less sharp, more fluid. Swing? No, that isn't it either. The bathroom is of
much comfort, garnished with its loving mirror. Your reflection spends hours
chronicling stories mother dare not invent. French monkeys with crumb covered
moustaches from munching on toast or a magical pogo stick with the power of
transportation to any roller coaster in the galaxy. You sit delicately on the 
cool
linoleum laughing, swaying, singing...letting your imagination, um, psychosis
overcome you with fluid grace. Your mind is a systematic painter of surreal
landscapes. Precious solitude. This is your childhood.</span></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After years of reviewing the aforementioned, most scholarly (you 
add with a
twisted smile of sarcasm) analysis, you come to the conclusion that you are, as
everyone is, a product of society. If you are to be labeled insane, so is the 
whole
of civilization. 'Tis an unbroken connection. To retain and chew on this
knowledge is an integral function towards insuring the future of your honest, 
god
fearing children to come. </span></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your father wails from his grave, tossing and turning, at the 
mere thought of
your poisonous womb bearing children. What rubbish, he declares to his rotting
wife in the adjacent plot. She would reply...had her jaw not fallen off the last
time an insult regarding the aptitude of their child was spout. Instead, she 
huffs
clouded air through empty nasal cavities with a mocking snort. You ignore this
mindless banter. These two are more lively in their current state of decay, six 
feet
under, than ever made visible in waking life. You are an only child, the
consequence brought= upon by their singular mingling of bodily fluid. You are
also aptly considered the pollution of life which drive your parents to demise.
How exactly you are the cause of a massive pulmonary attack in the left chamber
of your father's withered heart, or the abundance of mercury in the well water
where your mother bathes and drinks with clockwork frequency, is somewhat
debatable.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You experience adolescence restlessly. Less medication through 
the adaptation
of a life cloaked in disguise. Any original thought, any inkling of creativity 
is
kept far from the scrutinizing eyes of family members. The library is your 
bearer
of surrogate love. Expelling upon you vast amounts of illuminating thought. Her
tangerine carpet cushions your feet while corridors of books wink as you stroll 
by,
palpating their spines in search of your next great discovery. Music, art, 
history,
astronomy, philosophy. Subsequent to such absorptions, a realization that
mankind is littered with what you amusingly refer to as dippydoos, ingrains 
itself
into logic. You begin the pursuit to compile concrete facts determining where 
the
true nourishment of schizophrenic tendencies metabolizes. Your data is collected
recklessly into a myriad of notebooks. Mother with tight lips and chilled hands,
father whose Adam's apple bounces in his throat generating a voice of puny
waves. The bus driver with enlarged pores...dilating as if preparing to turn his
body inside-out. Sometimes they whistle tunes like &quot;Dixie.&quot; 
The crow who
surveys you from the willow tree with tilted head, your image shining in its
vacant eye. Yourself.</span></p>

vapid for
sustenance. Disappointed by Lain's inability to think for herself or take 
initiative.
Disgusted by Ethan's quest for what is concealed beneath your skirt. Crucified 
by
Candace, a once amiable neighbor who utilizes the insight she obtains from
attending dinners with your family. She preys on insecurities, belittles you 
with
caustic vision. Your inner monologue suggests that you are surrounded by people
who are inherently evil, and yes, they are out to get you. You prefer to 
associate
with the assemblage of characters in your mind. They materialize less 
frequently,
flourishing within the duration of sleep cycles. You trust these phantoms of
mystic quality. The topic of sporadic haiku.</span></p>

charming with
childlike motivation. A constant referee in the struggle between creativity and
deconstruction persistent with your thought pattern. In attendance of a modestly
arranged art gallery you become engulfed by a painting you identify as the
absolute depiction of your inner beings. The contradiction of shape, the loss of
tangible form. Comfort in distress. You shake hands with the artist and do not

You
rationalize this sentiment by ascertaining that religious and legal merits have 
no
sanctity to you. Weddings are outdated rituals meant to define your status in
societal affairs. Secretly you profess a numbing belief that the end is as 
inevitable
as the beginning, and that marrying the man you so adore motivates drifting
closer to that insufferable end. You sleep nestled gently atop his left side. 
His
cheek sprouted with black hairs rests within the distance between the tip of 
your
nose and the ascending slope into your forehead. Your lily faced children are
amused by antics they do not comprehend. They blossom up adoring the way you
constantly look behind your back, scanning the empty slab of cement. You have
taught them to purposely step on every crack in the path ahead. It's about
challenging that crack. If it swallows you into the oblivion of a dark, fiery 
abyss
of hell, so be it. If not, you win! You have yet to lose a battle with the
discontinuity of man's invention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

Quite suddenly, you have aged decades in a matter of seconds. The mirror has
never lied before and will not begin today. Your reflection does not shoot back
witty comments, nor does it lull you to bed with fantastic stories of bandana 
clad
pirates in the form of tiny medicinal purposes. The world is not a place to be
examined microscopically, with ideologies awaiting pursuance. You find no joy in
sketching bunnies, reading graphic novels, making impassioned love, or
unapologetic remarks discrediting politics and patriotism. Your hair is the
transparent color of grey death. Your listless freckles are no more than blotchy
age spots settled wearily upon haggard, oversized skin. The relentless echoing 
of
ill-fated predictions from your parents are faint whispers in sweeping memories 
of
a life no longer possessed. You have so quickly lost your most idolized
indiscretion. Your bizarre imagination has leapt off without the decency of even 
a
good-bye kiss. You lived life so enraptured with the personification of youth, 
so
desperately fearful of growing old, that it hits you with merciless force. You 
are
doomed now to live without the probing of existence. You are doomed now to
die.</span></p>
