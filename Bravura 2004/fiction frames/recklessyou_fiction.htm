<span style="font-size: 10.0pt">By Shane Minter</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drives 
fast but I can’t even tell. I’m busy in the back seat. I’m drunk and speaking in 
tongues with some girl we picked up when the cops showed up at the party. The 
scene was hilarious, it left me in tears but I don’t know why. As soon as the 
lights flashed from atop the squad cars people scurried away like insects to 
whatever safe haven might be awaiting them.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’re 
driving at least twenty miles over the speed limit. A half full bottle of So Co 
dangles loosely from two of the not so designated driver’s fingers rocking back 
in forth like a pendulum. The wind is funneling through the windows in front 
numbing my entire body as I run my hands across her smooth form above and 
beneath her clothes silhouetting her from the waste up with force and thoughts 
as wild as his driving. We jerk forward as he stops at the stoplight. And for a 
second the shape I’m making with my hands gets wide and irregular.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The green 
and red hues of the stoplight seem to be highlighting our obscenity, as she 
lifts her head letting out a deep hard breath and he in the front seat chokes 
back another throat full of whisky. I look up at her with a smirk and notice she 
looks like a messy glob of flesh and hair. She looks down and bites what I 
believe to be her lip grabs a handful of my hair and forces her tongue deep into 
my throat. I can feel her forming vowels and consonants trying to make some 
drunken comment I’ll forget in tow minutes.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car 
speeds off again. The engine growls and roars while he pounds the gas pedal into 
the floor of the car trying as hard as he can to push straight through the 
carpet directly into the disappearing street below. I look behind me and see the 
bottle of So Co shatter into the a thousand pieces spreading across both lanes 
on our side of the road. We’re pushed into the back seat. The embers from his 
cigarette drift slowly into the back seat and explode on my face, yet through 
the deadening of my senses from cold and alcohol I can’t feel a thing.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’re still 
driving the three of us. His eyes burned into the road in front and us in the 
back battering each other with lips, teeth, and tongues. I pull back attempting 
to catch my breath and stare up at the rear view mirror. My chest expands and 
contracts and I’m panting heavily. His eyes meet mine in the mirror and I can 
see his face perfectly, every pore is defined and dark, his face looks like the 
striking pad from a book of matches. His look of utter disgust flows backwards 
from his chin up until his forehead is creased and wrinkled.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We run a 
red and barely beat a car traveling fast from the left side; I feel the shake as 
it travels behind us. His eyes were on me for the whole episode and he doesn’t 
even notice. He keeps driving and I look back to see if the other driver had any 
idea what was going on. I see the driver shake back to consciousness and swerve. 
I know that if he were driving any slower all of us would be dead. “Wouldn’t be 
that bad” I think to myself. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m kissing 
her again, her neck and her shoulders are red and I try to overlap bite marks 
that already exist, but every time I touch her skin she becomes less and less 
attractive. Mid grope he shouts back, “hey girl where do you live?” I laugh a 
little bit because I don’t know her name either.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Huh” she 
spouts, a gaping hole opens up in the middle of her blurred features.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Look I 
don’t want you coming to my house and he certainly can’t be having any company.”</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looks 
at me. The whole closes and the blur vibrates harshly. “I live with my parents,” 
I say, as I look out the window. The appeal is completely gone.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “How old 
are you again?” she asks slouching against the opposite side of the back seat.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Don’t ask, 
don’t tell,” I say giving her this degrading look and the blur melts into a 
frown. She sits up straight against the far end of the car forcing herself up 
against the window as she’ll fall through into a different dimension.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m tired.” 
She lets out a big humph and then gives him the directions.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We get to 
her house and me and her get out of the car. The cold air freezes my joints 
slowing my exit and a heavy misty fog hangs throughout the street. I hop in the 
front seat leaving her standing there on the sidewalk. He looks over and smiles 
at me with this huge grin. We drive fast and I look back as she disappears into 
the haze of two am.</span></font></p>
