<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">Southern California, 1987 --
</span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">As the sun rose 
over the horizon, the light chased the darkness into the shadows and under the 
rocks. Grady Waters and John Green marched side-by-side down a narrow dirt path 
that weaved through vast acreage of rolling hills covered in wild green grass. 
The tall grass beckoned gently to a soft wind while large clouds sailed across 
blue sky as if they were cotton ships in search of something mysterious.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">John stood tall with lanky 
arms and skinny legs. He wore a light blue shirt that draped like a bed sheet 
over his frail upper body. It seemed at any moment a small gust of wind could 
fill his shirt, and he would float away. He constantly pulled up his Levi’s that 
fit a bit too loosely around his waist. His light brown eyes complimented his 
bushy dark brown hair, which tangled around his ears. While carrying a cardboard 
box under his arm, he stared into the blue sky as he continued to march down the 
path. The sky reminded him of the many summer nights he lay on the blue grass in 
his parents’ front yard peering past the farthest stars into the deepest depths 
of universe. <i>If only all the answers the stars surely held could be examined 
by reaching out and gathering them up as simply as grabbing up a handful of 
sand, if only my arms were longer, </i>he thought.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">Grady resembled a soldier who 
had just barely graduated from boot camp. With fine posture and a stocky build, 
he carried himself well. There was an aggressive air about him, an attitude of 
cockiness. With short black hair and blue eyes, he wore a camouflaged T-shirt, 
green military pants, and red canvas high tops while a weather-beaten army pack 
hung over his shoulder. As he marched down the path he thought, <i>I should have 
brought my pellet rifle</i>.</span></font></p>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">Without speaking a word, the 
two teenagers veered off the path and entered the meadow. As they trudged 
through the wild grass like oddball soldiers on a top-secret assignment, they 
approached a lone pepper tree standing near a stream. As they crossed through 
the stream, a coyote darted past them and melted gracefully out of sight into 
some tall grass.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></p>

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;They crawled under the 
pepper tree and sat down in the fallen dew covered leaves. The tree sat calmly 
in the meadow while the faint sound of tricking water rang through the air. Spun 
between a few upper branches of the tree, spider webs covered with drops of 
morning dew glistened in the early sun. Grady dug through his backpack and 
pulled out a canteen of water. He unscrewed the cap, tipped the canteen to his 
lips, took a giant gulp and passed it to John, who also took a drink. Grady 
pulled an army shovel from his backpack and snapped it into working position 
while John peered out into the meadow and watched as a few yellow butterflies 
chased each other around as if they were playing a game of tag. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">As Grady sat under the pepper 
tree, he made his hand into the shape of a pistol and pretended to shoot at the 
many monsters his imagination conjured up and projected onto the landscape. 
Grady turned and pointed his hand, still in the shape of a gun, at John.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">“We better get started on the

<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">Grady and John crawled from 
under the tree. Using the shovel, Grady began to dig a long shallow hole. John 
knelt down next to Grady and used his hands to dig into the loose soil. He 
placed the handfuls of dirt into a neat pile. The soil felt soft and cool; John 
enjoyed touching it while Grady flung the dirt over his shoulder into the field.

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">Grady glanced at John for a

<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">After they finished digging, 
they crawled back underneath the tree and sat in the coolness of the fallen 
leaves. As Grady gulped down some more water from the canteen, John stared off 
into the sky. </span></font></p>

possess. </span></font></p>

the cardboard box and pulled out a large white rabbit. He held the rabbit by the 
scuff of its neck and pulled a small flea collar from his pocket. He fastened 
the collar tightly around its neck, pulled a long piece of string from his other 
pocket and tied one end of the string to the collar. He cleared the dirt away

<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">John walked down to the 
stream, unzipped his pants and began to pee. <i>Oh, that feels good,</i> he 
thought. While staring at the tulles and other greenery that lined both sides of 
the stream, he thought of the plants as spectators, who quietly cheered on the 
water as it flowed. Some of the plants grew thick and stubborn with slender and 
thorny leaves. They seemed angry as if they had been scorned from the very soil 
that had fostered them. Yet others were soft and stringy and their leaves were 
wide, fragile and covered with soft white fuzz. They seemed more peaceful than 
some of their neighbors. He watched as the water trickled over the rocks and 
through the waterways melting its way through the crevices settling gently into 
a clear pool. As he stared at his reflection on surface of the still water, the 
soft current continued to melt gracefully over the next set of rough edges. The 
current flowed faithfully trying to find something mysterious that lay deep 
within the crevices of its own path. <i>Perhaps</i>, <i>a deeper part of itself</i>, 
he thought.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">A faint cry rang through the 
air. John squinted and peered curiously across the stream. He scanned the small 
hillside for the source of the faint whimper and soon saw a small creature 
covered in mud trying to crawl from the stream up a muddy bank.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Is that a 
wet muddy rat?</i> he thought.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">“It’s a puppy,” John blurted.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">He watched as the puppy tried 
to crawl from the stream. Its face and body were drenched and muddy. While 
shivering and yelping helplessly, the puppy clawed its way up the bank only to 
slide slowly back down into the water. John finished peeing, zipped up his pants 
and walked through the water. He picked up the puppy and cradled him softly in 
his arms. The puppy continued to whimper as John made his way back across the 
stream. John knelt down, dipped the puppy into the water and rinsed the mud out 
of the animal’s eyes and soft coat.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>I am 
keeping you. This is definitely another sign</i>, he thought.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">While smiling and calming his 
new friend with a few soft strokes to the head, John glanced up into the sky 
over the pepper tree; he saw a large hawk circling.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh shit.”</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">While holding the puppy 
gently, John hurried back to the tree. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hawk 
circled lower and lower as John approached the pepper tree. Suddenly the 
predator dove down onto the rabbit. Grady jumped up with a jerk, flung the box 
off his head and grabbed the hawk by its legs.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I got it. I 
got it! I did it, I caught a hawk”</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">The hawk let out a loud 
scream, peered down at Grady and bit him on the nose. Grady screamed in pain as 
he removed one hand from the hawk's leg and rubbed his nose, which was red with 
blood. The hawk raised its free leg and scraped its claw down Grady’s face. He 
let go of the bird, and it flew off as the rabbit shook violently while having a 
heart attack. Grady rolled over into the fetal position and moaned in pain while 
Jon stood, eyes wide, beside the tree cradling the puppy. The rabbit continued 
to flounder violently for a moment, then lay motionless.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Are you all 
right?” John said softly as if speaking too loudly might make the pain worse for 
his friend.</span></font></p>

<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “No… I’m

<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">Grady rolled over to see the 
puppy in John’s arms. He stood up, wiped the dirt from his face, dusted the dirt 
from his clothes, walked over to John and peered at the small creature.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">A stream of blood dripped 
down Grady’s cheek as he reached out to pet the puppy.</span></font></p>

Lucky. His name is Lucky. I told you there are signs. This is definitely a

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 200%">
<font face="Verdana">
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">Grady and John buried the 
rabbit in the shallow grave and marked the spot with a few large rocks. John 
smiled as he thought of Grady’s inability to see the signs. They had been so 
obvious to him. As they headed home, they walked through the stream. John 
noticed the water was still running on faith -- discovering its mysterious path. 
Grady marched home while wearing his blood and wounds proudly as if they were 
medals given only to those who had proven to be courageous. With Lucky in his 
arms, John was deep in thought analyzing the signs of the day. <i>But why? Down 
what path would the signs lead? What mysteries would they uncover? </i></span>
