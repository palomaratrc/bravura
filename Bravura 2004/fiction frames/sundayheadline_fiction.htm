GOD SAYS &quot;I QUIT&quot;</span></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">VATICAN CITY-- In a surprise move, God 
announced through the Pope and other religious leaders today that He intends to 
retire at the end of the year. </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;It’s just not fun anymore,&quot; said God. &quot;I 
created the Universe to give people a place to live together in peace, and some 
of ‘em have to go and screw it up. More than two thousand years of hard work, 
and they think they can use free will to rewrite what I’ve worked so hard on… 
I’m done. I’m too old for this [expletive deleted].&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Citing recent events, including the 
over-commercialization of Christianity by such sources as Mel Gibson, Tim Lahaye 
and Jerry Jenkins, and the distrust heaped upon &quot;serious&quot; religious pundits like 
Jerry Falwell and George Herbert Walker Bush (who has stated that &quot;God wants 
[Bush] to be President&quot;), the Lord calls humanity’s dependence on various 
religions &quot;sad and hopeless. I let them write their books about Me to keep them 
busy, but they take Me for granted. They even put words in My mouth; I <i>never</i> 
told anyone to bash gay people, or anyone else who was ‘different’. Why would I 
do that? I <i>created</i> them, for My sake!&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">God has not yet named a successor, but He has 
expressed admiration for the work ethic of business mogul Donald Trump. &quot;Nobody 
can say, ‘you’re fired’, and make it stick, like that guy,&quot; said God. &quot;Just wait 
until some jumped-up radio preacher tries to talk back to <i>him</i>.&quot;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">God says that he has &quot;a nice place to retire 
to,&quot; but He wants to stay out of the public eye. &quot;I’ll keep tabs on people, but 
I want My privacy. It’s bad enough that so many prayers fill up My inbox; I 
don’t want any more Spam. And if one more Jehovan comes to My door asking for 
money, I’ll just <i>plotz</i>.&quot;</span></font></p>
