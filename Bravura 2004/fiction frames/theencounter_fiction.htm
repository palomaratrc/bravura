<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember 
how the sound of the iron devil surrounded the twenty-five story building on
Baralt Ave, 
back in 1976. Every single day coming back from school, I would feel tired, 
afraid, and overwhelmed trying to hold the butterflies in my stomach, my heart 
inside my chest, and my mind from spinning around. I would walk with rocks 
inside my shoes, dragging myself into the elevator dizzy and nauseous. “One 
thousand and one, one thousand and two, one thousand and three.” It was a long 
way up, all the way to one thousand and twenty-one. I could see the numbers in 
the elevator illuminate as they announced the impending encounter with the 
spirit of the iron devil. I could feel the walls of the elevator pushing me 
around, stealing all the air inside. I could feel my ears burn in flames and my 
hands sweat. While I was counting trying not to pass out, my body would do all 
kinds of involuntary responses which most of the time resulted in embarrassment. 
Finally, the door opened and I found myself confused. I could hear the spirit 
inside the iron pot whistle, furious, and steaming. I was eight years old when I 
decided to confront the horrible monster. I waited for him to be alone in the 
kitchen, and I was shaking. I took a deep breath and with all my strength I held 
his neck in my hands and strangled him. He exploded and all the insides of his 
brain and his body flew over the ceiling. I was in panic, paralyzed, when all 
his body mass and fluids landed on top of my head, burning all my thoughts and 
cleansing all my sins. From that day on I swore to obey my mom and keep my hands 
off the pressure cooker.
