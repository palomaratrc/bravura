</b>40th Anniversary Edition of <i>Bravura</i></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bravura </i>
first emerged in the mid-1960s, and for many of us, the 1960s exist not so much 
as a definitive time but as a collection of images stuffed into the dusty 
suitcase of our minds.&nbsp; Even for those of us who lived through the decade, 
these images have almost become detached from their historical context.&nbsp; 
Tie-dye shirts, Nehrus, Peter Max painting, black lights, Barbies, the pill, TM, 
LSD, free Love, free speech, and &quot;Free Abby Hoffman&quot; are but a few which come to 
mind.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But of course 
the 1960s amount to much more than a collection of cultural images.&nbsp; 
Tremendous social change and tumult marked the period.&nbsp; The Civil Rights 
Movement, the assassination of JFK, Women's Liberation, The Civil Rights Act of 
1964, Vietnam, The Bay of Pigs, student movements, the Peace Corps-- indeed 
suggest a more complicated social history.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One important 
legacy of the 1960s, especially for those of us concerned with the <i>Bravura</i> 
and literature at Palomar, is an appreciation of the important role creativity 
plays in all our lives.&nbsp; Another is the idea that each of us has a voice 
that should be heard.&nbsp; From this perspective, this year's <i>Bravura</i> 
represents a celebration of these very ideas, ideas that were present in the 
beginning.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Curiously, 
while the social and cultural contexts have shifted, familiar themes and 
preoccupations persist.&nbsp; Globalism, rising corporatism, international and 
cultural conflict of a new kind may have replaced Vietnam, civil rights marches 
and the mourning of a President, but love, the road, loneliness and the need for 
acceptance remain defining issues in the lives of Palomar writers. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, as before, 
in an ever-changing world no less vexing and intriguing than it was forty years 
ago, we celebrate the voices of Palomar.</font></p>
