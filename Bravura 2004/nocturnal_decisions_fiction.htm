<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">We left before sunrise, a 
good friend and I, but it could hardly be called morning, for we had not 
slept.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our eyes were still wide, swollen open, full of optimism, as they 
reflect the glimmering shimmer of city lights.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the vociferous voices 
of city cars.&nbsp;&nbsp;All keeping us on our toes, all letting us believe we could go 
anywhere in the world.<br>
<br>
Take me out, tonight<br>
Where there’s music and there’s people . . .<br>
<br>
“This album is fucking amazing!” I interjected.<br>
“God ...&nbsp;&nbsp;I know.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want this! I want to create something beautiful.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to 
do something that matters! God ...” <br>
“But we can!” <br>
“I know, we need to.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to be beautiful.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to do something!”<br>
“I know!&nbsp;&nbsp;We will.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to! ! 
!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.”<br>
<br>
And in the darkened underpass I thought Oh God my chance has come at last . . .<br>
<br>
The song lead us across the freeway junction, and we were now on the I-Five, 
heading dead north.<br>
“So you know how to get there pretty much, right?” I had to reassure the both of 
us.<br>
“Yeah, it’s just off the Five, and we’re there, pretty much.”<br>
“Ok, I was just making sure –“<br>
“--We’re fine.”<br>
“Alright.”<br>
<br>
And so we drove, up the northbound pass, a route notorious for its inspiring 
fields of generic vegetation, its comfortable stretches of consistent pavement, 
and its unmatched collection of themed roadside diners, a real treat for the 
hungry and desperate.&nbsp;&nbsp;I started to think about where we were headed, and why we 
were headed, and I remembered that I had forgotten what and where that was.<br>
I saw a bull fucking a cow from the passenger window.<br>
“Hah, that’s beautiful!” I pointed out.<br>
“What?”<br>
“Oh, nothing, just the mountains, they’re really pretty, nevermind.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Farmland somehow turned to forest, where the only light was that of our 
highbeams dancing about the fog.&nbsp;&nbsp;We kept the windows down to avoid the silence 
of our own voices, only to let in the icy echoes of the mountain air.&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
watched our eyes constrict the light, until we could only see the guiding yellow 
lines that painted the highway.<br>
<br>
The Sun eventually ascended us from the confusion of night, and the colors it 
brought along were truly angelic.<br>
“Didn’t we leave at sunrise?”<br>
There is a shade of blue that only exist in the wake of the morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is 
electric, bringing all that it touches to radiate in its stillness, a 
fluorescent spectacle that only nature could keep humble.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
“What?”<br>
Azure skies like this can only last a moment, and they vanish the instant you 
glance away to put on you shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this morning, I didn’t glance away.&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
didn’t put on my shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t go to work or class or do anything that might 
ever really matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I watched the morning sky stand still for eternity, 
and I never wanted to leave that car.<br>
“Nevermind.”</span></p>
