      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earl chewed a soupy wad of tobacco. Every few moments, he spat some of the black liquid to the ground. He lay on his belly, half hidden underneath a giant fern, near the base of a  Giant Redwood tree and peered out over the valley. Redwood trees surrounded the territory and towered toward the light of the sun. Brown and green pine needles carpeted the dark soil while the smells of mildewed wood and wetness filled the air. Large clumps of thick moss grew at the bases of many of the trees. The only sounds to be heard were the rustling of pine needles from the wind, the occasional creak of a tree branch and the sound that emanated from Earl's mouth when he spat his tobacco. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pinched one eye closed and put his other eye up to the cold lens of the rifle scope. He watched as a black bear cub wrestled with its mother in a small meadow no more than fifty yards away. The streaks of dark face paint he had so carefully applied before starting his long hike were beginning to smear due to drops of sweat dripping down his face. The soles of his combat boots were caked with mud and blades of crushed grass. His camouflage clothing was faded, tattered and decorated with washed out blood stains from animals he had killed in the past. A leather sheath that held his hunting knife was fastened to his waist by a military belt that he had kept from his days in the army. His grubby camouflage hat was turned around backwards. It had a rip in it where some of his twisted black hair stuck through. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earl wiped the sweat from his face, pressed his eye back against the cool end of the scope and continued to watch the two bears. The mother bear stood on her hind legs and sniffed the air. Earl had carefully positioned himself down wind from his prey; he knew she could not smell him; he knew he had the element of surprise.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lined up the crosshairs onto the mother bear's upper chest and slowly squeezed the trigger. As the sound of the shot rang through the air, Earl knew the mother bear would not live to see another day. The bullet ripped through her chest cavity, tore through her heart and exploded out her backside. Pieces of her flesh, bone and organs splattered onto a tree that stood behind her. She let out a loud moan, peered down at her wound and fell to the ground. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earl stood, scratched his belly, spat a juicy wad of tobacco and walked toward his prey. He knew the female bear was not worth much, but her cub would fetch a good price. He also knew the cub would not leave its dead mother's side. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cub pawed and licked at its mother's distraught face while she let out a loud groan and gasped for air. The bear cub circled the mother frantically. She lifted her head a few inches off the ground, peered at her offspring, let out a loving groan and breathed in deeply for the last time as her head fell limp to the ground. The cub whined then sat and stared at the mother's carcass, hoping she would jump to her feet, so they could flee. The sounds of snapping branches and rustling shrubs from the approaching intruder grew closer. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earl walked up and spat another wad of tobacco to the ground. Tears dripped from the bear cubs' eyes while it peered up at the stranger. Earl stared at the carcass, smiled, pulled a whiskey flask from his vest pocket, unscrewed the cap and took a swig. He stared at the bear cub and smiled.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My name is Woods. Earl Woods. But you can just call me Daddy, and I'm gonna call you Bacon.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earl took another long swig from the flask, screwed the cap back on and stuck it into his pocket. He pulled a leash from his pocket, reached down and grabbed the cub by its neck. The small bear whined, clawed and bit at Earl's hands. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bacon&hellip; Look at me Bacon.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earl squeezed the cub's neck until it winced and gasped for air. Earl stared into the bear cub's eyes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There ain't no sense crying. They not gonna care, where you goin'. Ya hearin' me Bacon? Just ain't no sense crying. I hate to see ya get all worked up. You gonna need your strength.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earl tightened the leash around the bear's neck, dragged it to a nearby tree and tied the other end of the leash to the tree. The hair on the cub's back stood up as he defecated and urinated on himself and the ground.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ya goin' to China. They gonna treat you real nice too. I can promise ya that. Know what they do with your kind in China? Do ya Bacon?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cub whined and shivered.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earl smirked, walked over to the carcass and pulled his hunting knife from the sheath. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's right&hellip; don't you worry none. Those Chinese goin' ta treat ya real nice. They gonna suck out ya gall bladder juice. That's right, Bacon. They gonna suck it out.&quot; Earl eyed the bear carcass for a moment then raised his head, peered at the bear cub and grinned.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Time to get to work.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earl kneeled down, inserted the blade of his knife into the mother bear's anal canal, smiled and began to slice her open from end to end.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Your momma is gonna make a fine rug.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bear cub whined, shivered and watched in horror as Earl spent the next hour turning its mother inside out.</td>
