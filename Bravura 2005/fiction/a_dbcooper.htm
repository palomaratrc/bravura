      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Thanksgiving Eve 1971</strong>- He paid cash for a one way ticket to Seattle at the Northwest ticket counter in Portland International Airport. Before signing the log book he paused, sighed then wrote D. Cooper. He wore a black suit, dark rain coat, gloves, wrap-around sunglasses and carried a large brown briefcase. At six feet tall with an athletic build, he moved casually down the long boarding corridor. The corridor connected to an open doorway built into the side of the fuselage, which was located a short distance behind the cockpit of the plane. He turned to the right and walked down the aisle, passing by other passengers, who were already in their seats. He continued toward the back of the cabin. There were plenty of empty seats available as flight 305 to Seattle was only a quarter full. He sat down in row 18, seat C, where he had the entire row to himself.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just before the 4:35 evening take off, he handed Florence Schaffner, one of the stewardesses working the flight, a note as she passed him by on her way to the galley. &ldquo;Read that,&rdquo; he said with a smile. She returned his smile with a small one of her own, slid the note into her pocket and continued toward the galley. Mr. Cooper sat calmly in his seat while holding his briefcase snug on his lap. &ldquo;Excuse me, miss.&rdquo; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florence turned and gave Mr. Cooper another faint smile.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;After take off could I get a double whiskey on the rocks, please?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why certainly,&rdquo; she replied.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plane took off and broke through the blanket of overcast that usually engulfed Seattle. A stunning sunset could be seen to the west as if God had smeared red lipstick all over the western sky. Shortly after the plane had reached a safe attitude and the seatbelts signs had been turned off, Mr. Cooper watched Florence as she approached him with a double whiskey on the rocks. He smiled at her, pulled a pack of Raleigh cigarettes and a lighter from his jacket pocket and calmly removed a cigarette. He put the cigarette between his lips, lit it, took a deep drag, exhaled and looked her in the eyes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Here you are sir. Let me know if you need anything else.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continued to stare her in the eyes while she passed him his drink and he handed her a five-dollar bill.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Keep the change.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you, sir&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned toward her and whispered, &ldquo;Miss, I think you should read the note I gave you. I have a bomb in my briefcase.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Excuse me? What did you just say?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I said you need to read that note I gave you. I have a bomb in my briefcase. I&rsquo;m hijacking this plane.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Cooper watched as Florence glanced at him then quickly walked to the Galley and closed the curtain.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she heard the words, &ldquo;I have a bomb in my briefcase,&rdquo; a stream of electricity had run up her spine, causing the back of her neck to tingle. The hairs on the back of her neck would have stood up straight except they were petrified in hair starch. <em>He must be some kind of nut case. He has to be kidding or crazy. </em>She pulled the note from her pocket, unfolded it and began to read.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am hijacking this plane. Do as I ask. Otherwise, I will detonate the bomb inside my briefcase. I demand four parachutes and $200,000 in used, unmarked, twenty-dollar bills. The captain is to fly the plane to Seattle airport where the plane will circle until the money and the parachutes are available. The plane will then land, and I will give the captain further instructions. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sincerely <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Cooper <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florence read the note three times just to make sure she was reading it correctly. She turned to Tina Mucklow, the other stewardess working the flight, and said, &ldquo;Oh my God&hellip; Tina look at this.&rdquo; Tina was tall, unconventionally attractive and wore her light brown hair pulled back and tied with a yellow ribbon. She read the note then slowly raised her eyes and stared at Florence. The young flight attendants glanced at each other for a moment then Tina said, &ldquo;Oh Boy.&rdquo; Florence hurried to the cockpit to show the note to the flight-captain.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Cooper noticed some of the passengers turning their heads and taking notice as the flight Captain sat down next to him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you serious about having a bomb,&rdquo; the captain whispered frankly.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certainly serious so no funny business,&rdquo; whispered Mr. Cooper as he opened his briefcase case and revealed two red cylinders attached together by numerous multicolored wires. He held the briefcase open just long enough for the Captain to get a good look then quickly shut it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Like the note said, I don&rsquo;t want you to land until the money and the parachutes are ready.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You want me to circle the airport?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, until they tell you the chutes and cash are ready. And no military parachutes. They must be civilian type with rip cords.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ok, anything else?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll have another double whiskey on the rocks.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Cooper watched as the fight captain stood, looked at him and shook his head.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Right away, we will do our best sir.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you captain. I appreciate your cooperation.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Captain calmly made his way back to the cockpit. As he passed through the galley he glanced at Tina.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bring Mr. Cooper another double whiskey on the house.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, captain,&rdquo; replied Tina.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tina delivered the drink to Mr. Cooper. &ldquo;This is on the house,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Well thank you. That&rsquo;s very kind of the Captain. The service on this flight is outstanding,&rdquo; responded Mr. Cooper, who insisted on tipping Tina five dollars. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the least I can do,&rdquo; he said with a smile. Tina did not know what else to do except return his smile and thank him for the tip. She walked back to the galley and spoke softly to Florence about the note and the skyjacker&rsquo;s nice manners. Mr. Cooper watched through his dark sunglasses as the stewardesses took turns peaking through the curtain at him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plane was soon circling the Seattle airport. The Flight Captain announced over the intercom the plane needed to circle for a few minutes while the runway was being cleared for landing. &ldquo;There busy down there tonight,&rdquo; he announced to the passengers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Cooper was informed by Tina that the money and the parachutes were ready. Mr. Cooper told Tina to tell the Captain to land and steer the plane to an open and well lit area of the runway. The plane touched down at 5:40 pm and taxied to an open area near an administration building, which was lit by floodlights.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Cooper sipped of his whiskey and took a deep drag of his cigarette as Tina sat next to him. &ldquo;The captain has a few questions. What&rsquo;s to happen to the passengers?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re to exit the plane by way of the aft staircase. Everyone except the flight crew and one stewardess&hellip; you.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Me&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, you&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay aboard and continue to help me communicate with the captain. This plane still has some flying to do.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why did you request four parachutes? Are you going to make someone jump with you?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Is there anything else I should know?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Only one person is to deliver the money and the parachutes to the plane. Have them park the vehicle fifty feet away from the plane and walk the chutes and the money up to the bottom of aft staircase. You&rsquo;ll take the chutes and the money from there and bring them to me. Is that understood? No funny business.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ok.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some of the passengers could tell something peculiar was happening, none of them ever became aware of the skyjacking. Everybody except the flight crew and Tina used the aft staircase to exit the plane while Mr. Cooper remained in his seat, sipped his whiskey and chain- smoked.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short time later the parachutes and the money arrived in a white van driven by an airport courier. Tina did just as she was told. She met the courier at the bottom of the aft stairs and carried the parachutes and money into the passenger cabin. Mr. Cooper inspected the moneybags and condition of the parachutes then told Tina to go tell the captain to take off and fly toward Mexico.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later Mr. Cooper watched as Tina walk back down the aisle way toward him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fly you to Mexico, but it&rsquo;s out of the plane&rsquo;s range. We&rsquo;ll have to stop in Reno, Nevada to refuel.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I know. Just be sure to fly at ten thousand feet with the flaps down. I have a watch- altimeter on my wrist. Don&rsquo;t go any higher than ten thousand. If you do, I&rsquo;ll know it. And no faster than 150.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ok. We&rsquo;re going to need to refuel before we leave. We need to bring a fuel truck to the plane.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Can one man do the refueling?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How long will it take?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;About fifteen minutes&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ok, then fill-er up. But remember, no funny business.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You got it.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plane departed from Seattle airport at 7:45 pm. A murky storm had moved into the area. Rain, snow and sleet fell as the plane moved south. Shortly after take off Mr. Cooper ordered another double whiskey from Tina. As soon as it arrived, he sucked it down, stood and politely asked Tina to join the flight crew in the cockpit until the plane landed in Reno. As she walked toward the front of the plane, Mr. Cooper pulled a knife from his pocket, unfolded the blade and cut a long piece of cord from one of the parachutes. He picked up one of the other parachutes along with the bags of money and walked toward the back of the plane.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the cabin wall was a plastic placard with the instructions for lowering the stairs. Mr. Cooper read the instructions then pulled the lever mechanism that lowered the aft staircase. A rush of freezing air and rain hit his face as the staircase lowered slowly.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tore the placard from the wall and threw it out of the plane He reached into one of the money bags and pulled out two decks of money and threw them out of the back of the plane too. <em>I hope someone finds some of that</em>, he thought.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat down and stared into the darkness. <em>Almost home</em>. The plane flew through a small amount of wind turbulence, which caused the stairs hanging out the back of the aircraft to jolt.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Is everything all right back there? Do you need any help?&rdquo; asked the captain over the intercom.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t need any help,&rdquo; yelled Mr. Cooper.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at his watch, sighed deeply, opened his briefcase, removed the two red cylinders along with the wiring and tossed it out of the plane. He pulled up a flat divider within the briefcase, revealing a pair of Levis, a flatten pair of walking shoes and a thin jacket. He pulled the clothes and the shoes from the briefcase, stuffed them into one of the moneybags and threw the briefcase out of the plane. <em>If they only knew the bomb was a fake</em>, he thought with a smirk. <em>Nothing but a couple of small fire extinguishers</em>. He sat quietly and smoked a few more cigarettes to help pass the time. <em>It&rsquo;s 340 miles from Seattle to Northern California. The plane&rsquo;s traveling about 150 knots, which means I have less than two hours before I jump. He glanced at his watch again. If I land anywhere in Northern California, I can find my way home. </em><em>I&rsquo;ll bury the money and hitchhike, if I have too</em>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the time grew near to make the jump, he stood and used the piece of cord he had cut from one of the parachutes to tie the money bags to his waist. He strapped the parachute to his back, walked down the aft stairs and jumped into the night sky. As soon as he started to free fall he began to count to fifteen, arched his back, tighten all his muscles and shot through the air as far west as the winds would take him. When he reached fifteen, he pulled the ripe cord and floated toward the ground.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I can&rsquo;t see a thing. Where will I land?</em> Suddenly, branches scraped against his legs and torso. He jerked to an abrupt stop as his parachute tangled in the trees above him. Floundering for a moment, he pulled a small flashlight from his pocket and shined it to the ground. He struggled to pull his pocketknife from his pants pocket and cut the lines that held him. When he hit the ground, he did what he was taught to do as a paratrooper in the army; he bent his knees. After tumbling a short distance down a small slope he came to an abrupt stop, flat on his back, at the edge of a stream. He lifted his head, stared at the stream and let out a loud grumble<em>. Where the hell did I end up? I hope I&rsquo;m in Northern California</em>. He stood and checked the moneybags, which were still tied around his waist. <em>Good, the bags are undamaged, the money is safe</em>, he thought while sniffing the air intensely. <em>Something dead is near. That smell is awful</em>. He shined his flashlight around and noticed the stream ran into a cave at the base of a cliff. After looking into the darkness of the cave for a moment, he shined his light up into the trees and onto the tangled parachute. <em>Shit</em>, <em>I have to get that down and bury it. They might be able to see it from the sky in the morning.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>He untied the bags of money from his waste, set them on the ground and climbed up a large Sequoias tree while holding the flashlight between his teeth. Halfway up the tree, he removed the flashlight from his mouth, rested on a branch and caught his breath. Drops of sweat ran off his forehead, dripped off his chin and nose and disappeared into the darkness as the drops of sweat fell silently to the ground. He shined his flashlight up into the trees and stared at the tangled parachute. He sighed and continued to climb upwards. He shimmied out onto a branch, grabbed part of the parachute, pulled a small knife from his pocket and cut that section of the parachute free. For the next hour, he continued to sweat profusely as he climbed from branch to branch and cut and pulled each tangled part of parachute free. Finally, the parachute fell to the ground.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He climbed down from the tree, rolled up the parachute, picked it up and walked over near the entrance of the cave, where he found some soft soil. Using his pocketknife, a large stick and his hands, he dug a hole and buried it. As he pulled the last layer of dirt over the parachute, he heard a loud growl coming from inside the cave. <em>Oh shit, must be a bear, not good</em>. He stood, quickly gathered his gear and shined his flashlight inside the cave. For a moment, he stared at Eerie Shadows from the running water dancing on the cavern walls. From behind him in the darkness of the trees, he heard another loud growl. <em>Shit, two bears. That&rsquo;s unusual. They&rsquo;re feeding. That smell, the rotting carcass of a deer or a cow? I&rsquo;m out of here.</em> He turned and headed up stream. The fowl odor became extremely intense as another loud growl sounded through the darkness. <em>The creature that made that growl was close&hellip; Real close!</em> He turned toward the sound of the growl and shined his flashlight onto the face of an eleven-foot tall male Sasquatch. The creature bent down and peered into his eyes. He felt the creature&rsquo;s warm breath on his face as the Sasquatch let out a fierce cry. He leaped backwards and fell to the ground. &ldquo;Holy shit,&rdquo; he screamed as he stood up and shined his light onto the creature. The Sasquatch peered at him intensely, flexed his massive upper body muscles and let out another horrific cry. Mr. Cooper lowered his eyes and stood perfectly still.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creature peered at him then let out a series of loud barks. Its warm breath streamed out from it nostrils and mouth into the cold night air as if it were white smoke coming from a fire-breathing dragon. Mr. Cooper raised his eyes and stared into the creatures at the massive creature.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sasquatch grabbed him by the neck and lifted him off the ground. Mr. Cooper tried to scream but he was so full of fear no sounds came from his mouth. The Sasquatch pulled him in close and bite off his nose then threw him to the ground. Mr. Cooper stood, wiped his hand across the spot where his nose used to be and let up a loud scream. A stream of blood spurted from the middle of his face. Standing in front of him was another massive monster. The creature picked him up by the neck and held him in the air as the other Sasquatch grabbed one of his arms, tore it off and threw it to the ground. The creature tossed him to the ground. Other Sasquatches came out from the surrounding trees and closed in on him. He scurried around trying to find his missing arm, thinking if he found it, he could pick it up and flee. <em>But my nose,</em> he thought <em>what about my nose</em>. He kneeled down, looked up and began to cry as he heard the heavy breathing of Sasquatches all around him. A Sasquatch picked him up and held him in the air while other Sasquatches took turns ripping his remaining limbs from his torso. The Sasquatch holding him in the air grabbed his head with both hands, ripped it off and held it in the air as his torso fell to the ground. His blood drained from his body and saturated the soil. The Sasquatches spent the next few minutes picking up Mr. Cooper&rsquo;s limbs, head and torso. One of the Sasquatches picked up the money bags and walk into the cave. One by one they walked into the cave, knowing they would all eat well tonight.</p>
