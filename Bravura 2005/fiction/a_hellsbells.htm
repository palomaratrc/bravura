&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's the moisture in the air. From the ocean,&quot; he responds. &quot;A lot different from the dry desert, isn't it?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh huh,&quot; she smiles, relaxing against the seat, as the cool air from the open window rushes around her. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several strands of hair escape from her long, blond ponytail and dance in the breeze as her breathing becomes heavier. Secure in slumber, her mind slips back to the elevator. The one she had been trapped in for fourteen hours. By the time the elderly maintenance man and three firefighters pried open the steel doors, she was almost nude, except of course for her lavender thong. Despite several sessions with her shrink, she still was not convinced they understood about her struggle with small spaces. Since then, it had become worse. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awakened, she asks, &quot;Do you think the hotel is near the boardwalk?&quot; Eyes still closed underneath her sunglasses, she tries to change her thoughts by visualizing the endless rolling waves of the ocean.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We'll find out soon enough,&quot; he responds, slowing the car and making a right turn.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Are we there, already?&quot; Sitting up, she lifts her glasses and squints to see in the bright sunlight. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are everywhere&hellip; eating, shopping, laughing. Everyone is tan and happy, just what she wants to be.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yup. You've been sleeping for the last hour,&quot; he says. His eyes linger on a girl wearing a black dental floss bikini. &quot;This is livin!&quot; he grins.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, you!&quot; she says, grabbing his arm. &quot;Honey! Look! It is right on the boardwalk. I feel like I'm in paradise.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together they walk into a salmon colored hotel as the sun begins to sink into the warmth of the sea. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're in luck, sir,&quot; the reservation attendant says with a smile. &quot;We have one room left. Shall I have the bellboy bring your suitcases?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Great! We'll take it. No, we can get our own bags,&quot; he responds. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Very well, sir. I'll just have him show you to your room.&quot; With a ring of the bell a kid barely sixteen, wearing a white t-shirt and faded blue jeans appears. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Right this way, sir,&quot; he says, walking towards a hallway. Eagerly, they follow close behind.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How old is the hotel,&quot; he asks, as they walk up three flights of stairs. Beads of perspiration dot his forehead.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm not sure,&quot; the young man responds, looking at their room key for the third time. &quot;Twenty, maybe thirty years. Would you like me to find out for you sir?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, just curious,&quot; he says, distracted by a long, thick trail of ants marching up the wall and disappearing into a crack in the ceiling. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's the heat wave. With these record high temperatures they are worse than ever,&quot; the boy says, noticing his glance. &quot;They're searching for water.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, well. A few ants never hurt any body,&quot; he says, giving her a squeeze. &quot;Besides, it's California! I bet everyone has them.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wasn't so convinced. Vacationing on top of an ant colony was not her idea of fun. Once as a child she stepped off the zoo trail onto a red ant bed. She was only five at the time, but the painful welts on her swollen legs remained vivid in her mind. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing down the hallway, a musty smell hangs in the air, as they try not to notice the stained carpeting and peeling wallpaper. &quot;Probably from the salt air,&quot; he whispers to her. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Here it is!&quot; the teenager says, handing them the key. &quot;No need for a tip, sir. It's on the house.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young couple look relieved as he turns and leaves. They are on a tight budget. The cost of the rental car, gas to get there, a hotel room for three days and food, left little for extras, let alone tips. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I can't wait to take a shower,'&quot; she says, as he inserts the key, turns the lock and pushes the door open. Stepping inside they stand speechless as they look around in disbelief. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I&hellip; I think it bares a striking resemblance to our closet,&quot; she says. &quot;No, on second thought, the one at home is bigger.&quot; Placing her overnight bag on one of the beds, she feels a wave of panic rise inside her. Quickly, she removes her sandals and considers taking off her top.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Great! Just great! Singles?&quot; he says, staring at two twin beds. &quot;I swear I asked for a room with a double?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, at least it has a television,&quot; he thinks to himself. &quot;The play-off's are on tonight and I'll miss it if we try to find another hotel.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We'll just spend one night here,&quot; he says, pulling her close. &quot;Tomorrow we'll look for another hotel, ok? Why don't you take that shower. I'll relax and see what's on TV&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't forget to pull down the comforter before you lay down,&quot; she calls from the bathroom. &quot;Remember the story on Oprah about hotel bugs.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shrugs. &quot;Oprah this, Oprah that. What makes her the authority on everything, anyway,&quot; he grumbles. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What?&quot; she calls out over the sound of the shower.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nothing!&quot; he answers. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Settling on top of the bedspread comforter, despite Oprah's advice, he pulls the pillows out and props them behind his head. As he reaches for the remote control he feels a tingling on his leg and sees a large, wolf spider scurry between his leg hairs. In record time, his shoe is off, the spider is crushed on the comforter and slam dunked into the trash can with his bare hands. Only green ooze, a few legs and blood remain on the comforter. This he covers with a pillow and turns on the television. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Shit! What now?&quot; he curses as rolling vertical lines and scattered snow fill the screen. Only an occasional basketball player can be seen or the intermittent voice from a sports commentator heard.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, baby! That feels so good.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stares at the TV&hellip; then at the remote control. &quot;What in the &hellip;.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hmm, I like that&hellip;,&quot; comes through the thin wall separating them from the room next door. &quot;Hmmm, yes, oh yes.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I need a beer,&quot; he tells himself after listening for a few minutes. Pulling on the mini-bar door, he realizes it requires a room key to open, only someone has broken theirs off in the lock.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How's the game going?&quot; the girl asks as he considers punching the small, refrigerator door. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stepping out of the bathroom, she's covered only by a small, white towel. Her long, blond hair is combed slick and straight. Just the way he likes it. His eyes follow the glistening trail of water on her shoulders and down her back. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hmm, things are looking up,&quot; he tells himself as he trades one thirst for another.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Letting out a long, slow whistle, he reaches for her. &quot;How was your shower?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Felt great, except I had to run around in a circle under the shower head to get wet. Then to top it off, I was right in the middle of shampooing my hair and the hot water&hellip;..&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;YES! YES! YES!&quot; screams through the shared wall. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to him, she places one hand over her open mouth and stares. Rhythmic pounding shakes the room as they listen to a long string of expletives she has never heard in her life. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, silence. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Finally,&quot; she says with a sigh of relief. Breaking free from his embrace, she reaches for a tissue and blows her nose. &quot;I don't know why, but my eyes are stinging. &quot;Now, they won't stop watering.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a matter of minutes, she's wheezing and searching for her inhaler. &quot;Honey, this is a non-smoking room. Right?&quot; she asks. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Damn the internet budget travel guide,&quot; he says avoiding her question. Climbing on the bed, he tries to close the vent above them. But, a nagging itch on his leg distracts him. &quot;Last time I follow their advice.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let's open the window. Maybe we have a view of the ocean,&quot; she says after two squirts from her inhaler. Eagerly, she pulls aside the faded, heavy velour drapes and looks out. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hell's bells!&quot; she cries out. An expression she has used since childhood to express an incredibly shitty moment. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mere three feet from the window's opening, stands a brick wall. Salmon in color, it is the left wing of the hotel. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hell's bells?&quot; he says, as she stretches out her hand and feels the rough texture of the brick. &quot;Shit, this is fucking ridiculous! Shoving his fist into his pants pocket, he feels the room key, yanks it out and sends it flying across the room. It tumbles on top of the bed, then slides to a stop close to her.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speechless, she picks it up and stares. &quot;You've gotta be kidding,&quot; she mumbles. A few seconds later what starts as muffled snickers turn into full blown snorts of laughter. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What?&quot; he asks annoyed. Itching his legs again, he notices numerous small, red welts. &quot;What is sooo funny?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah, ah, ah, snort, hahahahaha, snort, snort&quot; is all she can say. Handing him the key, she motions for him to read the chipped, gold print. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Room 666!&quot; he hollers. &quot;Hell! Why didn't somebody say so!&quot; <br></td>
