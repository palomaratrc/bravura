&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It happened again, this time in the corridor for all to see. I was sitting there in my apartment, jotting down a few notes from my text book and dreaming of what I could become. That is when I heard her, the nameless women from the upstairs apartment. nameless, and yet everyone seems to know her face. First I heard a loud thud against the thin wall of my apartment followed by a whimper of pain. I looked outside my window and saw something on the floor. I left my apartment and came around to where the object was. All around me it was stagnent, silent. I picked up the object, her purse and proceded to fill it with the scattered belongings. Some children were looking from their upstairs window, I asked if they dropped anything. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; I went back into the apartment and looked for identification. There was her drivers license, a happiness on her face that I had never seen. Along with it, his I.D. card, a straight face and eyes that seemed void of emotion. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stepped outside the door to take it to her and there she was. Mascara running down her cheek, hair all a mess. She was terrified. I asked if she wanted to come inside. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s okay, I&rsquo;m fine&rdquo;. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly came up behind her and hurried her up the stairs to their apartment. I heard a voice from behind me, &ldquo; Just come in the house, there&rsquo;s nothing we can do.&rdquo; Again I heard a thud immediately followed by a whimper. I ran up the stairs, &ldquo;What the Hell do you think you&rsquo;re doing?!&rdquo; He looks at me with those vaccant eyes, blue eyes that would seem angelic were it not for the evil behind them. He was a small man, at the tallest 5&rsquo;5&rdquo; very thin. &ldquo;No, no&rdquo;, she cries, &ldquo; I just dropped something, I swear.&rdquo; She is quick to defend him. What is this hold he has on her, Fear? Money? Could she actually love him? He doesn&rsquo;t love her, that&rsquo;s obvious. He just wants something he can control. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just go babe.&rdquo; How could she call him babe after what he has done to her? She runs down the stairs. He tries to follow, and I step in front of him. In an attempt to hide his cowardice he looks towards me and says, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; It was then I realized I was not alone as a voice comes up from behind, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dick!&rdquo; We let him pass, and as he left we saw a scratch mark on the back of his neck. Her last attempt for an escape. Does he like to see her run in fear of him? Is it a joy to mark his property with a brusie? Something I will never understand. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back at my apartment I stand there and cry. I hear, &ldquo; This is how the world is, there&rsquo;s nothing we can do.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s nothing we can do... <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t sleep last night.</p>
