A women&rsquo;s voice behind me broke the steady hum of washers and dryers in the laundromat. The small yellow room swelled with the weight of anguish. Startled by her outburst, I glanced at her. One of the regulars in the small laundry, I imagined. Prince Harry&rsquo;s brush with marijuana blazoned on the front page of the London Times held my attention while I waited for my wet wash to spin dry so I scarcely noticed her when she came through the door dragging a plastic bag full of dirty clothes. She&rsquo;d greeted the attendant, a tidy narrow-eyed graying woman who sat behind a counter at the back. Now the woman stood with her back to me. Tall, too thin; dirty blond hair touching her shoulders. One hand cupped a mobile phone to her ear, the other hand searched the pocket of her long white sweater.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, no, he&rsquo;ll kill him. I know he will.&rdquo; The woman strode past me through the open doorway onto the street, fumbling with the cigarette she&rsquo;d dug from her pocket. The musty smell of wine and cigarettes trailed behind her. She held the mobile phone tight against her mouth and dropped her voice to a whisper. One shaking hand put the long brown cigarette in her mouth and lit it. The morning light illuminated her hair and gusts of smoke that drifted from her mouth with each word. She strode back and forth between the doorway and the line of dryer machines as she talked, the heels of her rundown boots pounding the linoleum floor. I watched as she opened the dryer door and placed her hand inside, felt the clothes, then withdrew it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the laundry, you fool, such things have to be done.&rdquo; The mobile phone was still clamped in her hand, her lips brushed the receiver. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right now,&rdquo; she said, her voice calmer. She saw me watching and turned away. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wondered what happened to her. Who could have caused her outburst of anger then calmed her down so completely. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The police came, yes, they talked to me, but...&rdquo;, whomever she spoke to broke in. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was she about to reveal what happened to her? I tried to concentrate on my newspaper; pretending I wasn&rsquo;t listening to the personal tragedy unfolding around me. I read the same sentence over and over before she spoke again; in tears once more.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell him, I told you; he&rsquo;ll kill...&rdquo; her voice dropped to a whisper again. Her face crumpled and she wiped her eyes with the hem of a towel she&rsquo;d just pulled from the dryer to fold. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe her dog had been poisoned, her cat perhaps? She looked to be the kind of fragile person who would be that upset. The police would take a report on the possible poisoning of a pet. She would be afraid to tell the owner; her husband&rsquo;s dog, maybe? Yes, that must be it. This scenario made sense. Out of the corner of my eye I watched her pull clothes out of the dryer and stuff them into the plastic bag. Sheets, towels, gray underwear, a faded orange tee shirt she started to fold, held to her face for a moment, then abruptly threw into the bag. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m stronger than they know,&rdquo; she said to the attendant, lifting her chin and brushing her hair back from her face.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Right you are, love,&rdquo; the old woman said, then came around the counter to briefly hug her. The woman&rsquo;s face softened. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said to the old woman, then hoisted the bag on her shoulder and disappeared into the normalcy of the busy street outside. As the hum and thump of washers and dryers once again filled the room, the old woman behind the counter shook her head and said, &lsquo;That girl lost her thirteen year old son to a drug overdose last week.&rdquo;</p>
