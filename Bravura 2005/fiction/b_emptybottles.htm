      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jane woke up on the couch of her dingy apartment. She rolled off her bed, which would soon be turned back into the couch it was meant to be. She went into the bathroom, washed her face, and brushed her teeth. She looked into the water-splattered mirror and stared hard into her reflection's eyes. A stray piece of her dark brown hair caught her attention, reminding her of her father. She remembered how his hair was always messy and he never cared. She remembered back to a time when everything was right in her life. Back to when her dad was alive, her mom was sober, and she was happy. She took in a deep breath and walked away from the mirror, leaving the stray hair in place. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jane walked outside to the pay phone at the corner to call home. She inserted her quarter, dialed the phone, and sighed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; her brother answered.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Josh, why aren't you at school?&rdquo; It was a Tuesday morning and he should not have been home. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Mom was passed out drunk when I woke up and I thought i should stay home and take care of her. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well is she awake now?&rdquo; Jane pounded on the side of the phone, harder with each word.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, but she's been drinking.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Let me talk to her.&rdquo; Mary was always drinking. It had happened so many times before. Jane would call home, Josh would answer the phone and Mary would be drinking or drunk. She drank ever since Jane's father died. Mary left Josh to take care of things while Jane was at school.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hi Jane, how are you?&rdquo; Mary slurred.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I'm fine mom, why are you keeping Josh home?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well I didn't know he was home until i woke up and then I just decided to keep him here to help around the house.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You mean to take care of you? Mom, you can't keep doing this. He's only thirteen. You know, instead of staying home and drinking all day, you could go to an A.A. Meeting. Or, you could do things throughout the day to stop you from drinking.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Jane, you know I don't have enough money to do things.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You would if you didn't spend it all on booze. I'm sure Aunt Beth wouldn't mind taking you to meetings.&rdquo; Aunt Beth was Mary's only sister. She would take Josh to school everyday and give him money for lunch. She helped out when Jane was up at school.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She already helps out enough. Maybe you should stay out of this. Do you work this weekend?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, not until Monday. They've been cutting my hours.&rdquo; Jane cleaned tables at and upper east L.A. Restaurant called Le Jorge. Although her fellow employees treated her horribly, she enjoyed seeing rich people come in and out. She admired their jewels and designer clothing. She watched each of them spend over a hundred dollars on food and drinks and then turn around and leave only a few dollars for the waitress.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, you can't lose your job. We need the money. I need you to come home this weekend. We need groceries, and I'm sure Josh misses you.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, I'm sure. I'll be home then. Oh, and mom, I miss you too.&rdquo; Without giving her mom a chance to say another word, Jane hung up. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That's so unfair,&rdquo; Mary thought to herself. She wondered why her only daughter talked that way to her. Jane would never get her to quit drinking. It was a drug and she was past the point of addiction. Mary got off the couch and walked to the kitchen, stumbling over herself on the way. &ldquo;I' m not an alcoholic,&rdquo; she slurred aloud to herself. She took a glass from the cupboard, placed it on the counter, opened the fridge, grabbed the juice and poured herself some. After taking a sip, she made a funny face and put the glass down. Juice just didn't taste the same without Vodka in it. She took the Absolut out of the fridge and proceeded to fill her glass to the brim. &ldquo;I don't need meetings, I'm perfectly fine.&rdquo; she said and gulped the juice down. Josh wandered into the kitchen only to end up helping his mom to the couch. &ldquo;Jane's coming home this weekend. Write a list of what you want from the store,&rdquo; she said, just before passing out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning Jane woke up from a reoccurring dream she'd been having about her father. He wore a blue and yellow plaid shirt with a pair of old blue jeans. Jane was seven years old in this dream, and for the past few nights, she dreamt that they were at the park down the street from her house. Her father was pushing her on the swing and everything around her seemed so real. She was happy and her laughter grew louder around the two of them. Her dream then switched dramatically and soon, her drunk mother replaced her father. She was now 15, on the swing, with her mother right behind her, wearing the blue and yellow plaid shirt and old blue jeans. Her mom would push her so hard and she was never able to stop the swing. Her mother stopped pushing, but the swing never slowed down. Her mother walked in front of her and stood there, drinking from a bottle of Jack Daniels, laughing. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jane's train home was leaving in a few hours and she needed to get herself ready to go home for the weekend. It didn't take her long to pack, she didn't have many belongings.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary wanted to show Jane that things weren't as bad as she thought. Beth had come over earlier to help clean up the house, but she was gone and it was just Mary and Josh. She decided to cook dinner for the three of them and was in the process of making mashed potatoes. Josh was tearing lettuce for the salad, eating pieced as he went along. &ldquo;Mom, please don't fight with Jane this time. Maybe if you don't fight with her, she'll come home more often.&rdquo; Mary's eyes got big and she smashed her finger on accident.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Dammit! Josh, do you two always have to make me out to be the bad guy? I try hard at this too, but sometimes the pain is too much.&rdquo; Tears began to stream down her face and she left the potatoes, half mashed, on the counter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As dingy as Jane's apartment might be, the bus ride through town made her miss it. Her apartment seemed glamorous compared to the town her once beautiful home is located in. As she passed by the old abandoned church, the faint memory of Sunday mornings with her father returned. She vaguely remembered waking up to the sound of her father's voice and hand in hand, they would go to church. Jane remembered how she didn't very much like church, but she loved spending time with her dad. As a tear fell onto her lap, she shut that memory out and stared out into the hopeless town she was traveling through. She saw a lonely, broke down car and immediately connected it to her mother. She noticed how similar they were. How, once the car was full of life, and now it's broken, falling apart, empty and alone. She snapped out of her thoughts and realized her stop was next. She stopped the driver and was soon standing on the dead grass at the end of her street. Once she got to her house, she stopped and took a breath, like she did every time. She walked inside to find her brother sitting at the table in front of an unmade salad. She noticed an entire unfinished, uncooked meal in the kitchen. &ldquo;Where's Mom?&rdquo; she asked.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Her room. She's mad at me.&rdquo; He rolled his eyes and continued playing with a piece of lettuce.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Because I asked her not to fight with you.&rdquo; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jane sighed and went to her mom's bedroom. Mary looked up at her and looked away.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Mom, what's wrong?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You! Can you go finish making dinner please?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No. What do you mean, me?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I can't fight with you, just leave me alone.&rdquo; Jane walked out of the room to prevent an argument. In the kitchen, she started to finish the meal that lay uncooked on the counter. She began boiling the water, when her mom stomped in.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I have a question for you two. Why is it, that every time there is an argument, it's my fault?&rdquo; Mary sat herself in the chair across from her son. &ldquo;The reason I argue is because you two accuse me.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Nobody accuses you mom.&rdquo; Josh insisted.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You did. I don't try to argue, but you two don't give me a chance. Josh, I need to talk to your sister, alone.&rdquo; Josh got out of his chair and walked to his room. &ldquo;Jane, I'm beginning to think that it's not a good idea that you visit anymore. At least not for a while. Beth can help with groceries and take care of Josh.&rdquo; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What are you talking about? You can't tell me not to come home.&rdquo; Jane had just gotten home and didn't have time to cause any problems. &ldquo;What's bringing this on? I do nothing but help you and care about you.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It was ok before, but when Josh asked me not to fight, he was in the wrong. Fighting with you is inevitable, but I' m not about to start fighting with him. You need to stop trying to create conflict here.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Mom, I don't! Are you drunk or something?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That's another thing, Jane. You need to stop bringing up my drinking.&rdquo; Mary said, avoiding Jane's question. &ldquo;I will stop when I want to stop. If your dad was still alive...&rdquo; Jane interrupted her.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If Dad was still alive what Mom? You have to stop blaming your drinking on his death. Yes, it hurt, but Josh and I moved on. You need to as well, and no more of this 'someday' shit. It's been five years.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That's not fair Jane. I'd never tell you to move on. I'm sorry I can't be the way you want me to be, but he meant a lot to me. You know how long I knew your father, give me time.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Take all the time you need, but you're not dragging me and Josh down with you. Drinking was not your only option mom, it was just the easiest.&rdquo; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I can't take this Jane. Yell at yourself before you yell at me. I began drinking, you just ran away. That junior college of yours was your way of dealing with things.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, mom. College was my way of getting away from you!&rdquo; Jane and Mary stood there in silence.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fine! Stay there then.&rdquo; Mary walked to the cabinet and grabbed a bottle of Jim Bean. She walked into her room and took a tattered picture of her husband out of her drawer. Crying uncontrollably, she drank until there was nothing left. Letting the empty bottle fall to the floor, she laid back on her bed, holding the picture tightly. &ldquo;I need you now more than ever.&rdquo; She said quietly. She closed her eyes tightly and slowly drifted to sleep.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the kitchen, Jane sat there in the dark. &ldquo;I can't believe I said those things,&rdquo; she thought to herself. &ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I need you now more than ever.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither of them talked the entire weekend. Mary would avoid her daughter as much as possible and Jane spent half her time figuring out a way to apologize. Josh decided to go to his aunt's house for the weekend to avoid hearing them fight. The only way Jane could figure to apologize was to leave a note for her mom. When it was finally time to leave, Jane left the note, taped to a bottle of Jack Daniels that sat in the fridge.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bye, Mom,&rdquo; she said quietly to her mom.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bye.&rdquo;</p>
       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Tuesday afternoon and Josh was finally home from school. His day had gotten worse by the hour and he was ready to lay down and forget about it all. When he walked in the door, the house was quiet. The T.V., the lights, and the heat were off and the house felt lonely. Mary was asleep on the couch with an empty bottle in her hand. What Josh really wanted was to sit down with his coherent mother and talk about his day. Instead, she was passed out. Even if she was awake, he knew she would be drunk. It was better this way. Josh walked into the kitchen and opened the fridge. It was empty, except for the Jack Daniels bottle with the note attached. He hadn't really eaten much all day and needed food. Josh slammed the fridge door closed and leaned hard against it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This is shit!&rdquo; He began opening every cabinet looking for something to eat, but found nothing. He got to the last cabinet, opened it, and three unopened liquor bottles caught his attention. He grabbed the clear bottle, &ldquo;Absolut Vodka,&rdquo; he read. He opened the bottle and took in a deep breath. The strong, acetone smell caught him off guard and he set the bottle down. After a few seconds of staring at the bottle, he picked it back up and took a drink. &ldquo;How does she drink this?&rdquo; He said as the liquid burned his throat. He thought about the bottle for a while and decided that he wanted more. &ldquo;If she can drink this, so can I.&rdquo; He took the bottle into his room and sat on his bed. He turned his stereo on and let the sounds of Nirvana blast out of his speakers. He drank almost half of the bottle, and went to sleep.</p>
       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirst overcame Mary as she got of the couch and walked to the kitchen. Mary opened the cabinet and grabbed a bottle of whiskey. She was hoping to have some Vodka and cranberry juice, but the Vodka was gone. She went to lay back down on the couch, but Josh's music was too loud.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Josh, can you please turn that down?&rdquo; She yelled while pushing the door open. She noticed Josh laying on his bed, asleep, with her bottle of Vodka in his hand. She walked to the radio and turned it down. &ldquo;Josh!&rdquo; She yelled, as if still yelling over the blaring music.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Josh shot up out of bed and stared blankly at his mother. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What are you doing with my alcohol?&rdquo; Mary was upset, not only that Josh had been drinking, but because she wanted the Vodka he had taken.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I'm sorry Mom. I was hungry and there was no food.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That's why you're drinking? Because you're hungry?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, not really, but it's not important.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary set the bottle, she had in her hand, down on the desk next to her. &ldquo;Son, whatever it is, it's important to me.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I was having a really bad day. Actually, I've been having a few bad days. There are some guys at school that have been picking on me because I don't have a dad. I've been kind of upset lately, and when you get upset, you drink.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That's why you drank? Because I drink? Josh, those boys don't know what they're talking about. You know you're no better, or worse, than them. You don't need to drink. You're too young to do that.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So, it's ok for you because you're older? Or is it ok for you because you lost a someone you loved? Either way, it doesn't make sense. If you think it's ok for you to drink, than I think it's ok for me.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Josh! It's not ok! It's not ok for either of us. I do not want you drinking.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I do not want you drinking either.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, if I make a promise to you, to try and stop drinking, will you promise not to drink too?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I promise not to drink, if you promise not to drink. Not that you'll try to stop, but that you will stop.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ok, as long as you don't drink, ever again. I wont drink anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Jane, I need you to clean table three. The set it as reserved.&rdquo; Jane hated working. As she looked around the restaurant, she noticed one of her co-workers, Jessica, sitting down and talking on her cell phone. &ldquo;There's no way she can do it, huh?&rdquo; Jane thought. She walked over to the table and started to clean it. The bus boys didn't clean the dishes off the table, and she was stuck with it all.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Jane, forget table three. Put tables seven and eight together. Clean them too,&rdquo; Jane's boss told her, mid-way through cleaning table three.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Can I finish this one first?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, you can go back to it when you're done. I need tables seven and eight cleaned now. A party of nine is one their way, and I promised the table would be ready.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don't you think it looks bad for us if a table is left uncleaned? Maybe Jessica can clean it.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Jessica is on her break. Clean the tables now, or leave for the day. I' m not going to make someone else do your job.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jane sucked back her words and started to clean the tables. Faster and faster she cleaned, thinking about just how much she hated her job. She noticed the people at table five watching her, taking little breaks here and there to talk. Jane imagined what their voices sounded like. She imagined the words they were using, only assuming they were talking about her. She scrubbed harder as she thought about how they were probably talking about her worn black shoes and her not so perfect pony tail. As she moved on to table eight, she started to think about Jessica's break. Jane had been there for five hours now, and hadn't had a break yet. Jessica got there an hour ago and had already spent fifteen minutes of her phone. Jane thought about her boss always saying that breaks were to be spent in the back, and the table cleaners were not to be seen. Jane scrubbed hard, completely forgetting about the vase that sat in the middle of the table. She hit the vase with full force; it fell off the table and onto the floor. The restaurant got very quiet and all eyes were on her. The vase lay shattered on the floor in a small pool of water. The rose that had, before, sat in the vase, was now on the floor, broken in two. As Jane struggled to pick up the pieces, the whispers around her grew into loud chatter. The muffled words of the guests sounded like words of judgment to Jane. Jane's boss began to walk over to her.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Jane, I need to talk to you in the back. Carlos will clean this.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jane picked herself up off the floor with as much strength as she could muster.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the office, the two of them sat there quietly. Jane's stomach would not stop fluttering and she could feel her clammy hands start to sweat.<br>
&ldquo;Jane, is something bothering you? Ever since you got back from last weekend at home, you've been making mistakes.&rdquo; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jane knew her boss was only showing her concern, but Jane was afraid to talk about what had happened between her and her mom. &ldquo;We just had some issues at home, but they're resolved now.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you sure? If there is something wrong, you can tell me.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I'm fine. I'm just a little overwhelmed with school. My home life is fine.&rdquo; Jane stood up from her seat and started to leave.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Jane, I think maybe you should go home for the rest of the day. I' m not sure I can handle anymore mistakes.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without another word, Jane composed herself and began to leave.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Jane?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jane took a deep breath and turned around. &ldquo;Maybe you should think about how you feel working here. Maybe this isn't the job for you.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What do you mean? I need this job.&rdquo; Jane felt herself begin to cry.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I know, but you're obviously not happy. You don't talk to your co-workers. You don't even talk to me. I tried to be your friend, but at this point, I need to be your boss. Something is affecting the way you do your job, and I can't afford to keep you here.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you firing me?&rdquo; She couldn't help the tears anymore.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I've been thinking a lot about it lately, and after today, I think it's for the best. You'll find another job that you are happy with.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jane grabbed her belongings, and thanked her boss for the experience she had given her. She walked outside the restaurant and began to cry. She walked in unison with her tears. The faster they fell, the faster she walked, until she was outside her little apartment. She couldn't help but cry. She knew her boss was trying to be a friend, but there really was only one person she needed. She inserted her quarter into the phone and dialed the number.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hi mom. I...&rdquo; she paused. Last time she talked to her mom, it ended in a feud. She began to feel very alone and started to cry. &ldquo;I...I'm going to come home this weekend.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary, like any mom, noticed the crying. &ldquo;Jane?&rdquo; she began. She knew something was wrong, but she couldn't remember the last time she and Jane had a heart to heart conversation. &ldquo;What's wrong? Why are you crying?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I got fired Mom. I'm so upset because I know we need the money. I don't know what to do. How will I pay for school? How will I pay for my apartment?.&rdquo; Jane began to cry harder with each word. &ldquo;I...I miss Daddy.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary's heart sunk into her stomach. &ldquo;Come home now dear.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After she hung up the phone, Mary curled up into a ball and could not stop crying. All memories of Frank swept over her. She remembered their wedding. She remembered his face when Jane and Josh were born. She remembered his horrible tattoo that he wouldn't get removed because it contained the memory of a drunken night in Cancun. She smiled and cried harder. She was so angry that she couldn't help her daughter. She was angry that Jane missed her daddy and not her. She was alone and she knew that she needed to stop drinking. She knew that she was affecting everyone around her. She looked up and saw the bottle. Jack Daniels, her new best friend. She picked herself up off the floor and grabbed it. Mary looked deep into it and remembered how she had just walked in on her son drinking for the same reason. She remembered how she promised him that she wouldn't drink anymore. She closed her eyes tightly and took a drink. She opened them as the sweet taste rushed down her throat. &ldquo;One more drink,&rdquo; she said and proceeded to suck the half full bottle dry. &ldquo;One more drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was nearly eight o'clock when the train rolled into the station. As Jane parked herself onto a bus that would soon take her home, she looked around and noticed she was the only passenger. When the bus got to her stop, she thanked the driver and stepped off. The dead leaves crinkled beneath her feet and the light above her flickered, like it always did. She walked down her broken street and stopped at her mailbox. She remembered coming home from school and looking in the mailbox. She remembered the notes her mom would always leave her. Freshly baked cookies are on the counter, eat no more than two! she remembered, printed neatly on pink paper. The light from Josh's bedroom was the only light on and Jane smiled. She opened the front door and turned the light on. She felt whole again for a minute and then noticed her mom, asleep on the couch. She walked over, kissed her mom on the forehead, and shook her head. The empty Jack Daniels bottle lay flat on the floor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jane giggled softly before opening Josh's door. Surprised, Josh struggled hard to hide the alcohol he stole from his mom's liquor cabinet. &ldquo;Jane! What are you doing here?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I'm home for the weekend! How are you?&rdquo; She pretended not to notice that he was hiding something. She figured it was just a dirty magazine or something. Jane sat down on his bed and gave him a big hug. She took in a deep breath and the overwhelming smell took over.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I'm fine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is something wrong?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Have you been drinking?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lump formed in his throat and he swallowed hard. He pulled the bottle from behind his bed and started to cry. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why are you drinking?&rdquo; Jane didn't know about what had happened between Josh and their mom. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You mean mom didn't tell you?&rdquo; Jane shook her head and Josh began to tell her the story. He told her what happened and the promise she made to him. He told her that after that day, his days had been better. He told her how today had been so great, until he got home and found his mom. Jane hugged her brother tightly and whispered in his ear &ldquo;I will always be here. You can rely on me for comfort. You don't need to rely on alcohol.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Tell that to Mom.&rdquo; They were now crying together.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jane's grip on her brother got looser. She got up, shut Josh's door, stomped her way to the kitchen and filled a glass with cold water. She stood over her mother, her eyes glazed over from tears, and poured the cold water on Mary's head.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What the!&rdquo; Mary screamed. &ldquo;Jane, what are you thinking?&rdquo; She was shaking from her drunken slumber. &ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why didn't you tell me that you caught Josh drinking?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Because Jane, I didn't think it was any of your business. We talked about it and everything is good now. I'm his mother, you're his sister. I think it's about time you started acting like it.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Mom, you have no idea what you're talking about. You didn't settle anything. You broke a promise to your son.&rdquo; Mary's heart sunk and she understood what Jane meant. Josh walked out of his room with the bottle of alcohol. &ldquo;You're right, Mom. You're his mother, and I'm his sister. And I think it's about time you started acting like it.&rdquo; The three of them stood there in silence. Jane walked over to her mom and hugged her. &ldquo;Mom,&rdquo; she sighed. She couldn't say it enough. &ldquo;You have to stop drinking.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I want to, but I can't do it alone. I have nobody. You're away at school, you live away from home, and you only call to talk to your brother. Your brother is too young to be helping me. I need you, Jane.&rdquo; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their tears soon fell in unison and neither had noticed that Josh had left the room. Jane fidgeted with a necklace her dad had given her for her tenth birthday. She took the necklace off and handed it to her mom. &ldquo;This necklace always helped me move on after he died. I miss him too, but we're not going to be happy again if we don't move on. Fighting, drinking, and running away is not going to bring him back. When you need me, I am here.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary put the necklace around her neck and grabbed her daughter. They held each other tight and memories of the relationship they once had returned. They knew at that moment they didn't need anybody but each other.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Dear Frank,<br>
          <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really miss you. I wish you had never left us. This letter to you is supposed to be a way to move on, but I worry. I worry that it won't be enough to help me. Jane has been a big help. I've finally stopped drinking. Well, I'm trying, day by day. Jane decided to take a semester off from school to stay here and help me move on. She wanted to stay at her apartment and find a new job to pay for school. We worked out a deal that if she stayed home for a while, I would finally get a job and pay for things on my own. I'm grateful that she's helping me like this. She's doing more than she needs to, but it's really helping. I promised both the kids that I'd never drink again, but I think, most of all, I need to make that promise to myself. Jane and I go to A.A. meetings together, three times a week. It makes it a lot easier for me when she's with me. She really is wonderful. I don't know why, for the past five years, I didn't see that. I wish you could see the woman she's become. Everyday, I see you in her eyes. And Josh. He's growing up for be such a strong young man. He was having some issues with some of the school kids, but they've been resolved. He understands, now, that the words they say don't mean anything. He also talks about getting a tattoo one day, like the one you had. I miss you so much. We all miss you incredibly. I will love you forever and always.<br>
        <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forever Yours,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary</em></p>
