      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fingers tightened around the tip, gripping it with a gross passion. He tested the blade of the razor on them, flinching under the pressure. He twisted it, flexing his hand as he slid the blade down the center of his palm. Skin blushed white where the blade had kissed it, rising for a second touch. Panting, he pushed the blade into his wrist, rocking it ever so slightly back and forth. He convulsed, blinded by pain. The blade fell to the ground. The sound was harsh, metallic. Akin to none that he had heard in years. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unwillingly, his knees unlocked, softened. The floor came closer with each beat of his heart. Unwillingly, his hand shot out, reaching for the blade. His fingers grazed the edge of a shard. Bloody fingers found their way to his mouth. His tongue wound around them, caringly, seductively. Lips pursed and released. Blood flowed in rivers over the peaks and valleys of his tongue. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passed. Tears drained from his eyes. Horror, along with acceptance replaced them as he looked beside the blade, to the shards that had first been one, then few. Now, there were hopeless millions. Slivers, even the tiniest speck could break further.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fingers slid from his mouth, shepherded by an anxious tongue as if sheep. His hand found the razor, closed around it, lifted it with mind-shattering concentration. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of the blade found the groove it had created. Metal bit skin. Pain soared through his veins. He dragged it along the track ever so slightly. Not too far now. Patience. Again, from start to finish. Again, again. Flesh pulled at the metal. He became blind to the agony. Mechanically, again. Again. Red oozed to the surface, painting designs on broken flesh as the instrument swept back and forth, to and fro. His wrist was the violin; the blade, his bow. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He struck a lower note. New life fled to peaked skin. His pain became a chord, a crescendo in a master's symphony. Blood splashed the shards of glass, disfiguring them past their unrecognizable state. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweat gathered between his fingers. The blade slipped. Fell to the floor. He sank, shards embedding themselves in his knees, crumbling beneath the weight of his thoughts. His mouth opened in a noiseless scream. No one could hear him. He couldn't cry, couldn't breath. Couldn't sleep.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that it would do him any good.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kale was caught in his own personal nightmare.</td>
