      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Cans,&quot; he says, clearly talking to me, &quot;I work in cans.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What?&quot; I say, turning to face him. I'm walking out Safeway's door with two shopping bags heavy with six packs of Diet Pepsi in my hands. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long hair pulled back with a rubber band reveals a gaunt face, a sharp beak of a nose scabby with peeling skin, wispy tendrils of a beard. Clothes the color of the earth he walks and a worn khaki backpack on his narrow frame distinguish him. Long fingers grip a bulging Hefty bag flung over one bony shoulder. His presence fills the air around us; I feel a vacuum snap shut. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I work in cans. Collect 'em for the world,&quot; he says, rolling the bag off his shoulder to the ground in a rattle of clicks and clanks. It rests against his leg, thigh high. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've spotted him striding up East Vista Way near my house, as if the burdens he carries are weightless. Up close he looks different than I expect.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrusting a hand into the back pocket of his chinos, he pulls out a business card and holds it out. His nails are trimmed and clean. &quot;See? Cans.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pinch the card gingerly between my thumb and forefinger. It's wrinkled and rimmed with dirt as if it's passed through many hands. &quot;World On My Back Can Collecting, A. Luminum, Owner,&quot; I read. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man peers at me waiting for acknowledgement. His blue eyes are clear and serene under graying bushy eyebrows. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're 'A. Luminum'?&quot; I ask, suppressing a laugh. The earnest, open expression on his face telegraphs caution as I hand back the card. Dense, fruity air swirls toward me drawing the vacuum tighter. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Didn't used to be, but I changed it when I figured out how important the name was. People pay money for it, you know, so I changed it.&quot; He smiles revealing a chipped front tooth then sees me glance at his mouth and quickly raises his hand to cover it. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tried to bite off a can lid,&quot; he says from behind his hand, low and muffled. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Does the 'A' stand for something; an abbreviation...?&quot; My curiosity is like a magnet. The fruit smell stuffs my nose, thickening effervescent, choking in my throat. I can't pull away from this bearded soul whose frequent appearance so often caught my attention. &quot;Just 'A',&quot; he says. &quot;Makes it easy for people calling my name, like you know, 'A, you want these cans?' &quot; He glances down at the bags of six-packs in my hands.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;These aren't empty yet,&quot; I say, gulping for breath. Backing away from him at last, I hear a soft hiss.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh, that's okay, too heavy anyhow. I like 'em light.&quot; He grins wide, the chipped tooth a gaping hole. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I nod, then turn toward my car, take a few steps and look back. When I do, I swear I can see the faint image of the Safeway sign reflecting off his torso.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't forget me when they're empty,&quot; he calls out, waving his business card. &quot;A. Luminum.&quot;</td>
