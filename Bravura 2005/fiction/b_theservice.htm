      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Chi and his wife Chau trod the endless steps of the paddle wheel lifting water to their rice field. Behind them, the river, still swollen from the late spring rains, roiled its cinnamon cargo toward the sea a thousand miles away. Lu Chi tolerated the mind numbing climbing by imagining the things he would buy with the money from his crop. Always in his daydream there was a son. A handsome boy of fifteen or so helping with the planting or harvesting. This part of the dream could hurt Lu Chi if he examined it too closely. He and Chau were childless and, after fifteen years, hope was fading. He wondered what his wife did to make these long afternoons tolerable. Did she have her own daydreams? Was there a child in her fantasies? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the sun dropped low over the emerald hills, Lu Chi looked to the west, toward the pear orchards of the prosperous Woo family. The Woo children were playing among the trees. Blossoms were blowing in the breeze, and they where running about trying to catch them as they fell. The Woo Children would never know hunger or hardship. He remembered, as a boy, when his mother had once possessed a pear. She peeled and cut it for him. He could see it in his mothers hand and drink its aroma. He could taste the sweet juice on his tongue. He took Chau's hand in his and walked the low dike surveying their field. The water, just a few inches deep, covered it uniformly. Rows of green sprouts stuck a bit above the surface of the water, like emeralds gleaming in the sun. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It will be a good crop this year,&quot; he said. He remembered, long ago, when he was a boy, and the rice plants turned a rusty brown and died. Many people had starved that year. Lu Chi was hungry more than once and he remembered his parents missing meals so that he might eat. His mother died of the fever that year. He smiled at Chau. Her face lined with exhaustion, she tried to return the smile. She walked ahead silently. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the last sliver of sun winked out over the hills they entered a small house that was their family home for many generations. Lu Chi lit the lamps and Chau started preparing the evening meal. In the dim light, the lines of her beloved face softened. She looked like a girl again. Lu Chi took a whetstone from a drawer and began to sharpen a knife. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What do you cut with these knifes? They are dull already,&quot; he asked. He heard the annoyance in his voice. Chau did not reply. He moved the blade across the wet stone back and forth in a monotonous motion. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Chi remembered the visit, five days before, of Chau's sisters and their children. It pained Lu Chi to see the longing in his wife's eyes, watching her nieces and nephews play under the willow tree next to the house. Did the gods intend such a good woman to be destined to live her life in endless toil, no sons to care for her in her final years? Sometimes Lu Chi believed the gods were only for the wealthy. Nevertheless, each time he went to town he gave the priests a few coins for a prayer. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his wife cooking rice in a crude earthenware pot over a small flame. He felt embarrassed and ashamed that he could furnish only the barest necessities for his wife. He had not heard her laugh for a long time.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The field will not need more water for several days. Tomorrow I will walk to town and buy our supplies,&quot; he said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let me go with you and help you carry our provisions. You are not a young man anymore,&quot; Chau pleaded. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There are still many good years left in these bones and someone needs to care for the rice crop,&quot; he replied. She looked disappointed, but said nothing more.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chau served the rice and vegetables. Lu Chi noticed her red and callused hands. Old before her time, He thought, as she poured the tea. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tomorrow I will leave before dawn,&quot; Lu Chi said. &quot;I will try not to disturb you,&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chau inclined her head in acknowledgment They ate in silence.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Chi dressed in the dark, careful not to disturb Chau's slumber. He stopped at the door and considered everything he would need, the rack to carry the goods, the food Chau had packed, his money. He stopped. He had nearly forgotten the most important item. After verifying that Chau was asleep he moved his fingers along the base of the wall until he touched the gold coin he found there. He pressed it into a hollowed niche in his shoe. Confident that he was ready, he quietly slipped out of the house and briskly walked south on the road. The cool predawn air slept with the rest of the world, with only the click of his shoes against the well worn stones to break the silence. As he stopped to adjust the carrying rack, he could not hear the slightest sound or feel a hint of breeze against his cheek. The world was truly asleep.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An hour into his journey Lu Chi's pace continued steady and strong. Long days of pumping water to his field gave him the stamina to walk many miles without fatigue. Ahead he could see the cross-roads that marked the two thirds point of his trip. A man on horseback waited near the stone marker pointing the way to Chengtu.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Lu Chi approached the cross roads he could see the man more closely. He wore heavy leather armor and carried a long barreled musket. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Give me your money.&quot; The man said holding the muzzle of the musket a foot from Lu Chi's head.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Please I am just a poor farmer,&quot; Lu Chi pleaded and fell to his knees. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a great howl of rage the horseman struck Lu Chi sharply on the side of his head with the barrel of the musket.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Chi awoke confused. A mixture of sensations engulfed him. Voices and the sound of horses and barking dogs buffeted his ears. He smelled garlic cooking and fresh blood and the fetid odor of animal urine and sweat. His head throbbed. A bleared image of a woman was swabbing his temple with a solution that burned.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah, you are finally awake. You have had a long sleep. Here, eat some noodles and rice,&quot; she said. Lu Chi sat up on the mat and obediently took the food. The room wavered momentarily. Then his vision cleared. A handsome woman with wisps of gray in her hair kneeled over him. As soon as he started eating, she left the room. When he had finished, a man appeared beside him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Lu Chi, I am Yang Chien. We have never met, but my nephew, Li Chien, brought you here. He found you, unconscious, beside the road. He tells me our family owes you a great debt.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know him well,&quot; Lu Chi replied. &quot;I buy chickens and eggs from his father.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He tells me you helped save his brother when their house caught fire. And, you gave them rice. Now we are given the opportunity to help you.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Chi made no reply<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Were you attacked by bandits?&quot; Yang Chien asked. &quot;He found you at the crossroad to Chengtu yesterday morning.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I remember a man on horseback. He demanded money. I remember nothing more.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Did you know this man? Had you seen him before?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No. He wore leather armor over his coat. His musket had an intricate design like snakes slithering along the barrel. He looked too prosperous to be a thief,&quot; Lu Chi said, pushing himself up from the mat.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yang Chien frowned and slowly nodded his head. &quot;He must be a deserter from the armies fighting in the north. He could have stolen the horse and musket from some fallen officer. I will tell the magistrate tomorrow. Enough talk for now. Lu Chi sank back onto and mat and fell into a restless slumber. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When next he awoke, the throbbing had subsided. Long shadows from the open window indicated late afternoon. But, of what day? He felt as if he had slept for a very long time. Yang Chien entered the room and kneeled beside him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Your eyes are normal again. You will be fit to leave tomorrow.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How long have I been here?&quot; Lu Chi asked.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Four days.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Chi bathed and dressed in his freshly laundered clothes. His head still throbbed with sharp stabbing pains, but he otherwise felt fit. Yang Chien entered the room where Lu Chi sat.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Are you still in pain Mister Chi?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, my head throbs when I stand.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I have something that will help if you will join me in the evening meal.&quot; Yang Chien walked into the next room and sat at a gleaming red lacquered table. &quot;Please sit,&quot; he said beckoning to Lu Chi. &quot;My wife is preparing a special dish which I am sure you will enjoy. In the meantime I have something to ease your pain.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yang Chien opened a polished teak box and removed a pipe and a blue glass bottle. He opened the bottle and poured some of its contents into the pipe bowl. &quot;I save this pipe for those special times when I seek freedom from the accumulation of pain that sometimes threatens us. Tonight it will ease the pain in your head as well.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a bamboo sliver from the box and lit it from the lamp in the center of the table. Holding the burning bamboo in the pipe bowl he inhaled repeatedly, until the pipe was lit. He drew the smoke deep into his lungs and handed the pipe to Lu Chi. Lu Chi inhaled the smoke and immediately began coughing. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yang Chien laughed.&quot; I see the fruit of the poppy is new to you. Here. You take too much at once; inhale just a bit. That's right. Is that better?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Chi felt a great weight lifting from his head. The throbbing pain receded into the background until it finally disappeared altogether. Yang Chien took the pipe and set it in a holder that he took from the box.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yang Chien's wife brought bowls of rice and noodles with pieces of chicken, pork and duck. She left and returned with a dish full of chopped pears and nuts in a honey sauce. Lu Chi was dumbstruck. He did not know where to start. Slowly he began picking at the rice.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This woman is a treasure.&quot; Yang Chien said. The Emperor himself does not eat this well.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opium made Lu Chi bold. &quot;Tell me Mister Chien, how did you meet her?&quot; The poppy seed smoke purged the question of offense, and Yang Chien answered candidly.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I was an apprentice in my father&rsquo;s shop. About twenty years old I think. After the day's work, my father introduced me to a gentleman from Guangxi province. He told me this man would be my father-in-law, and I was to marry his daughter in a month. This, I was told, was arranged when I was only five years of age.&quot; Yang Chien lifted his cup and took a long sip of tea. &quot;I must tell you this frightened me a great deal. I laid awake nights wondering if she was ugly or stupid. What if she hated me? When the time came for the wedding and I first saw her, I fell in love. She has been by my side for thirty-five years and born me eight children. I could not have imagined a better wife.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tell me, Mr. Chi, of your family.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Chi lowered his head. &quot;My wife and I have no children.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yang Chien saw the disappointment and shame in Lu Chi's eyes.&quot;How did you meet your wife? Was it an arranged marriage too?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No.&quot; Lu Chi replied. &quot;She was the daughter of a wealthy farmer whose farm was not far from mine. Both my father and mother were dead, and I was left to run the farm alone. I was thirty-two when I first saw her. She was but sixteen. Her mother, father and two of her sisters were on their way to town when the carriage in which they were riding broke an axle near my farm. I helped them repair the axle. When I saw her, I thought she was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen.&quot; Lu Chi took another puff from the pipe before continuing. &quot;I worked at night doing many jobs on the farms in the valley. I saved my money and bought a cow. When I offered the cow to Chau's father for her hand in marriage, he accepted. He considered her unmarriageable and would accept any offer. She had a birthmark. On the lower right side of her face and neck. There was a large light brown stain. I barely saw it; I was so taken by her. We were married, and within a year the birthmark faded away. She just needed a little sun.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dinner concluded with a serving of fresh pineapple; it tasted like summer sunlight on Lu Chi's tongue. Lu Chi and Yang Chien puffed on the pipe for a few more minutes and then retired.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Chi left the house early the next morning. He walked down the street and turned left into a dark cull de sac. At the end of the short street, he entered a small shop. The shop was filled with decorative household items, bronze statuettes of gods, paintings for walls and wind chimes. Lu Chi approached the proprietor. &quot;Did you get the item I ask for?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, I think you will be very pleased; it is the finest we have seen in years.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Chi pried the gold coin from his shoe and handed it to the man. The man reached under the counter and got Lu Chi's package, wrapped in brown paper and tied with grey string. Lu Chi put the package in his pack and turned to leave. &quot;Wait!&rdquo; said the proprietor. &quot;This is far more money than I need. You have change coming.&quot; He counted out a number of paper bills and handed them to Lu Chi. Lu Chi was relieved, now he had enough money to buy the supplies he had come to the city for. He left the shop and walked quickly to the market place. He bought the tea and spices and dried fruit salt, sugar, cloth and thread and all the things that they would need in the coming months. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later that evening, after his long walk home, with only the cicada love song breaking the silence, Lu Chi sat with Chau as she brewed a pot of the new tea. Only then did Lu Chi hand her the parcel wrapped in brown paper. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Puzzled, she removed the paper to reveal a teak box with brass hinges. Her eyes widened as she slowly opened the box. Inside were objects wrapped in pale pink and blue papers. Trembling with excitement, she carefully unwrapped the paper on each object. When the last wrapping had been removed, a porcelain tea service sat on the table before her. Tears streamed from her eyes as she held the translucent ceramic to the lantern light. Red and blue birds were painted on the tiny cups, the design so delicate she held her breath afraid she would damage it. When she raised her hand to examine each piece, Lu Chi saw the blue bruise encircling her wrist. &quot;Now you will no longer be ashamed to serve tea when your family visits.&quot; Lu Chi said softly. Chau threw herself into her husband's arms and sobbed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am so fortunate to have such a good man. If you could see how unworthy I am, you would surely send me away.&quot; Lu Chi caressed her with soothing words and held her for a long time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early in spring when new buds sprouted from the trees and the patches of hoarfrost were thawed by midday, Lu Chi took his new son from the arms of Chau's mother. Chau's sisters and their husbands all took turns admiring the child, each smiling and nodding as custom dictated. The children playing along the top of the dike would soon have a new playmate. Gifts were abundant and the men of the family congratulated the father for producing such a fine boy. Chau's father donated a sapling pear tree, and her sisters gave baby furniture and clothes. The celebration lasted late into the night.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Chi slept late the next morning. When he awoke Chau had already fed the baby and prepared the morning meal for her self and her husband. As they ate, he said to his wife &quot;We are now ancestors; we have a son to tend our graves when we die as we tend the graves of our ancestors. After they ate, he kissed the tiny boy and went out to plant the young tree.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the corner of their small vegetable garden he found a place where nothing was growing and started to dig a suitable hole in the soft black soil. A few minutes later, his spade struck something hard. Believing that all the rocks had been removed from the land by his ancestors, his first reaction was annoyance. As he carefully removed the dirt and broadened the hole, the panic of incredulity washed over him. He could not have been more confused if the sun had failed to rise. With the dirt removed, he stood staring into the hole paralyzed with disbelief. Before him lay a musket, the helical laminations of the barrel revealing its western origin. Alongside the rusting weapon lay the nude and corrupted body of its owner. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recognized Chau's fish knife blade broken off in his chest. Pain shot through Lu Chi's brain in the effort to comprehend. Finally he closed his eyes tightly, hoping that it was all a dream. When he again looked down, nothing had changed. Angrily he stomped into the house. Grabbing Chau's wrist, he dragged her out the door and brought her to the edge of the grave. He looked at Chau and pointed at the corpse. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chau pleaded with her husband. &quot;He came while you were away. Chau explained in tears. He ate our food and made me cook for him. He beat me and tied my wrists with twine. He raped me again and again; he hurt me terribly.&quot; Tears ran down her cheeks as she spoke. &quot;I convinced him that I would not run away so he untied me. When he was asleep, I stabbed him in the chest several times until the knife broke. He got up, and hit me, and I ran out of the house. When I came back an hour later, he was dead. I let his horse loose and buried him here.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She fell to her knees and grabbed Lu Chi's legs. She pleaded with her husband. &quot;Please do not send me away.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Chau!&quot; He cried in a great wail of anguish, hastily throwing the pear tree into the shallow grave and frantically covering the roots with dirt. A sharp pain stabbed at his chest. His hands shook and a great weight dragged at his body as he walked aimlessly around the field and down to the river. He sat on the bank with his hands covering his face until long after sunset. Finally the lines in his face softened and he wandered slowly back to the house.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked closely at the sleeping faces of Chau and the baby. He saw his family and found it beautiful. Lu Chi set about cooking rice with vegetables and chicken. Chau would be hungry when she awoke.<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The years were good to Lu Chi, good crops and good health blessed their little family. The boy and pear tree grew to maturity. Lu Chi developed more respect for the gods and dwelled on the blessings he received. The family found contentment and peace in their simple life. For all his final years Lu Chi enjoyed, he never ate so much as a bite of the fruit of the pear tree. Chau, in her wisdom, never questioned him. Even now, when Lu Chi looks at the tree, he thinks of the long trip they made to get here, not knowing what will come next.<br>
