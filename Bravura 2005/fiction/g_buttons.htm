      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a shelf in my mother's bedroom is an old round, tin box with a peacock perched on a fence that resembles the Golden Gate Bridge printed in gold on the top with its tail sweeping around the lid, folded under and its head is looking backwards admiring it. It must have been something when it was new; but now, the black finish has a ruddy opaque patina and the peacock and its perch are barely legible. But even if I couldn't see it at all, I'd know it was there. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This box has been in my mother's room as long as I can remember. It's about the size of a small fruitcake or maybe it once held some fancy chocolates. But now, it's filled with buttons. Old buttons that my mother used to rummage through when she needed to replace one lost from a shirt or a sweater. Buttons that would get spread out on my mother's white nubby bedspread with the fringe at the bottom and I would admire them while she searched for a close match to the others on the garment she was mending. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the buttons are one of a kind, but many of them have at least another matching it and many more have more than two in a set. She must have pulled them off of sweaters or blouses that had worn out or gone out of style, but she thought the buttons were worth keeping. Or, when she was sewing a blouse or knitting a sweater and she had to buy a pack and had some left over. There are some still on little pieces of cardboard that says LaModa, $.70, and some in little plastic bags, the kind that come attached like a price tag to new blouses. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My favorites are the three matching rhinestone studded buttons that look like pink ladybugs. I used to line them up in a ladybug parade. I'm almost sure that they came off of a pink angora sweater the exact color of the buttons from the fifties with a shawl collar that you would wear off the shoulders. There is another one the same shade of pink but it's clear and flat like a cake platter with a swirl design and one rhinestone in the middle, sitting there alone like a cupcake. I wonder what year that shade of pink was so popular. Then, there's a red plastic button shaped like a flower that has scrolling like lace cut out of it. I remember a plaid dress that I wore, a hand-me-down from Laurie that had those buttons on it. There are loads of wooden buttons. One is shaped like a croissant, except that it is straight, another one looks like a bone and another still, is shaped like a miniature stalk of bamboo. There are brass buttons of every size, some plain dome shaped, dull and tarnished from years of handling and many that have some sort of crest on them, like you'd see on a military uniform, or perhaps they're from matching sailor dresses that my sisters and I all wore one Easter Sunday. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's this flat iridescent shell button the size of a silver dollar that has a clip on the back that looks like a bobby pin, as if it was supposed to be removed, then reattached before cleaning. There are corduroy buttons of varying sizes of wale and shades of tan and brown. There are some leather buttons. One leather button has a tuck and roll upholstered look to it. I think it came from a cardigan sweater my dad used to wear, the kind with patches on the elbows. Then, there's a plastic button made to look like leather. And there are many buttons that are rather plain, just part of the collection.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I sift my hand through to the bottom of the box, I poke my finger on something sharp. I pull out a heavy darning needle with some buttons dangling from a string of heavy thread. Suddenly, I'm back sitting on my mother's bed in the house where I grew up. She's ironing. I can smell the damp cotton steam rising from the shirt she's working on. I'm stringing buttons onto the thread and she's humming a song that I've heard before, but I don't know the name of it or the words. I look up and watch her, listening to the sound of the hissing iron as it melts away the wrinkles and her humming as it melts away my fears. After a while, I ask, &quot;Mommy, do you like to iron?&quot; as I admire the way she flattens a crease into a perfectly smooth sleeve. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, I suppose I do.&quot; She says, smiling at me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Will you teach me how to iron?&quot; I ask. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;When you're a little older&hellip; it's very hot and you could get burned.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll be careful.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thinks about it for a moment, &quot;Ok, let me lower the ironing board and I'll let you iron a hanky.&quot; She reaches underneath the ironing board to release the lever that raises and lowers the board and a horrible screeching sound cuts through the air. I put my hand over my ears. She laughs a little and says, &quot;This old rusty thing.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She spreads the hanky on top of the board and shows me how to sprinkle it with water from an old Coke bottle that has a dented cap with holes in it on top. I shake it upside down and water flies everywhere.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Easy, that's enough. We don't want to soak it, just get it damp.&quot; Then she puts my hand on top of the handle, with her hand on top of mine and we glide the iron over the hanky. The steam spits in my face and I have to look away. &quot;See, that's what happens when you put too much water on it?&quot; She says. I notice transparent yellowish stains splattered across the shear, worn square of cotton.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the hanky is perfectly flat, she folds it in half and we iron a crisp crease in it, then she folds it in the opposite direction and another crease is ironed in.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's it!&quot; she says. &quot;Now you know how to iron.&quot; She places the warm folded hanky in my hands and I cup it as if it were a little injured bird. Then, I carefully unfold it and admire the creases. I hold onto two corners and dance the hanky in the air to the same song my mother was humming. I wave it around like a little flag, watching it billow across the air. Then, I try to refold it the same way the creases are ironed into it, but it's not as easy as it seems it should be. After several tries, I finally get it. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now, put it in your pocket and you'll have a nice clean hanky when you need to blow your nose.&quot; She suggests.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm not going to blow my nose on it.&quot; I think about what to do with it for a moment. &quot;I'm going to use it for Barbie's bed... a sheet.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, that's a good idea!&quot; she smiles at my innocence. And, I smile inside because for a few moments, she's my Mommy, not Jeff's or Laurie's or Liz's or Amy's or Bill's. Just mine! And, for a few moments there is peace in our house and my mother isn't banging the teakettle flat out of frustration or locking us all out of the house for the day because we're driving her crazy or helping me choose a rose branch without too many thorns on it for my father to whip me with.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Times like these seem like distant glimpses into my childhood that somehow became buried deep in a big basket of dirty laundry, with more dirty clothes added all the time. Finding the button box has been like digging down to the bottom of the basket and rescuing a long lost, very wrinkled, but favorite t-shirt; one that has been smothering down there for many decades.</td>
