After six months on the road as Jacqueline's assistant, she had grown comfortable sleeping this way, knees to chest, surrounded by the props and costumes she sometimes wondered if an act of her own could top one day. Through the front window of the van, a neon Flying &quot;J&quot; sign blinked in rhythm with the Ronnie James Dio song she had not been able to get out of her head since Tess Tickles fell off her makeshift trapeze at the Pink Pony and cracked a rib. She sat for a minute in its glow, humming like a rainbow in the dark, and imagined herself on stage, swinging back and forth from a gilded birdcage, dressed in the finest rhinestones, ostrich and turkey feathers. She opened her eyes to a more humbling image reflected off the chipped mirrors covering the martini glass, one that made her think more of Big Bird than Marlene Dietrich. Six feet tall at twenty-two, her inexperienced limbs were longer than her soul could stretch. She had recently lost interest in the fads of vegetarianism and drug experimentation that often shaped the flat identities of more moderately shaped girls in her suburban community. In spite of the many yoga studios and new age storefronts that lined the streets of Encinitas, Beth felt lost in her own body. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had admired the way Jacqueline intimidated the other employees at the record store where she worked. The men that were usually bold to brag nonstop about their favorite independent musicians could hardly speak when she entered the store, and were quick to agree with Jacqueline that arena rock was still the hottest thing around. When she needed real assistance, Jacqueline always approached Beth, the only female employee. They both liked classic rock and vintage clothes, and eventually the two women became friends, though Jacqueline was at least ten years older than Beth (a fact she never admitted). Three days before her biggest tour as a featured performer, Jacqueline invited Beth to travel with her as her assistant.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she had first left San Diego, Beth's favorite part of the trip was stopping at truck stops along the highway, where she collected unicorn kitsch as though she had been raised in the south, with a preference for the winged Pegasus-unicorn hybrid, a laughable creature anywhere outside of the confederacy. Like a real trucker's sweetheart, she often tested the danger of envelopes filled with rattlesnake eggs, skillfully appraised velvet artwork, and rebelliously made meals from pecan logs and cherry Icee. But after watching the happiness of her friend Jacqueline grow to depend more and more on late night spending sprees, it saddened her to think about the work that went into each dollar lost in the giant gift emporiums. On this night, Beth waited in the van while Jacqueline shopped inside. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beth felt stiff from forced sleep, and wondered how much time and distance there needed to be between Ms. Jacqueline D'light and the city of Atlanta before she would be allowed to ride shotgun again. When they began the drive earlier that day, Jacqueline's grief over losing another pageant title was inconsolable, and Beth was asked to sleep in back while Jacqueline drove alone. During the previous weeks competition, Jacqueline had hoped to catch the eye of Kitty Rodriguez, one of the best managers in the industry. Instead, Kitty took one look at Beth onstage as she set up Jacqueline's props and decided she had the greatest ass she'd ever seen. Beth often struggled to stage the shows for Jacqueline, the gadgets being too heavy for a woman in heals to assemble; Jacqueline had liked the contradiction, until then. At first having no idea who Kitty was and why her compliment made Jacqueline twitch so unglamorously, Beth threw Kitty's business card away almost as soon as the bartender passed it to her. But the jealousy Kitty's attention inspired was harder for Jacqueline to discard. Rather than cause her friend further stress, Beth avoided the mention of cats or Kitty Rodriguez again. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacqueline had been sure she would win this year, with a new James Bond number that climaxed on &quot;Goldfinger&quot; as the canopy of her collapsible bed released a wash of metallic gold paint onto her body, glitter and sin being an irresistible combination in past winners performances. When Fanny Dulce placed first, choreographing &quot;Hot for Teacher&quot; with the old school-girl-in-ponytails routine, it became obvious that the title of Ms. Nude U.S.A. was not a true challenge, but a crown for sale to the highest bidder. Jacqueline refused to believe that year after year she had paid to entertain the manipulative bastards behind the &quot;pageant&quot;, instead finding it easier to plan on &quot;working harder for next year&quot; than to admit the contest was a fake.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had been an exotic dancer since her first marriage at seventeen. Her husband was twenty-five years her senior, and pressed her to dance with cocaine and mental bullying that still had her checking the rear view mirror whenever she passed an all-you-can-eat Chinese food buffet or H.P. Salts Fish &amp; Chips, where he often conducted his personal affairs. He was long gone now, but she still danced for the easy money, and pageant titles were the only way she could book herself as a feature (aside from doing porn.) As in more traditional beauty pageants, age, or the appearance of youth, was everything to the sponsors. For Jacqueline, it was getting harder to find a self-tanning cream that would absorb into her skins growing collection of creases and dimples. The props that had once added personality to her dances steadily rose in size and intricacy, until in no moment on stage did she stand without the aid of some phallic shaped crutch. She was tired of fanning arousal with her customers; the mock interest she was obliged to show strangers each night left her too exhausted to take a real interest in anyone during the day. She didn't know which part of her loosely stitched being, body or mind, would unravel first, but she sensed her days were numbered.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in the van, Beth scanned the floor for the Candies that had recently replaced her Birkenstocks. It was taking so long for Jacqueline to finish inside, she thought she might as well check out the truck stops cassette tape display, usually able to unearth some discontinued gem hidden amongst the coal miner's daughters and rocky mountain highs. As she slipped on her mules, she admired her smooth legs, happy to have picked up the habit of shaving again, rejected in her former life as a punk record store employee, and resumed with Jacqueline's encouragement. It had never bothered Cory that she didn't shave, and Beth wondered what her ex-boyfriend would think of her now for doing it, among other things. Though these thoughts about Cory were getting less frequent, when she did think of their relationship, her heart pulled tight against her insides, and she questioned her motives for leaving. He had loved her, but she didn't know this person he loved, and chose to tour with Jacqueline instead of moving to Seattle with him. Just as her memory began to shift from curiosity to longing, the captain's side door of the van flew open, and Jacqueline dropped several stuffed Thank You bags on the bucket seat. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wow, what'd you buy?&quot; Beth had learned that part of her job was to always be supportive of Jacqueline's spending. But not only were the dollar amounts shocking (Jacqueline had once defended a $500 shopping spree on gourmet soaps by declaring Beth would never understand real glamour), the impulses that drove her spending seemed to be exercises in Satanic practice: &quot;responsibility to the responsible&quot; and &quot;indulgence over abstinence&quot; and so forth. Even then, as Jacqueline stood in the truck stop parking lot, she wore a gorgeous vintage coat at least three sizes too big, bought because she simply didn't want anyone else to have it. Beth braced herself for what might be the disappointment of learning her most wanted souvenir, a Dixie flag fanny pack, was within the contents of Jacqueline's shopping bags; she imagined it would lose all irony on the stripper's conquered hips.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I just had to have it!&quot; Jacqueline babied her words like a motherless child as she pulled the sad pacifier out of its wrapping and set it on the dash along side the more romantic souvenirs they had collected from Dollywood and Pedro's South of the Border, like the bathtub shaped ashtray filled with a naked ceramic beauty inviting strangers to &quot;Rest your butts here&quot;. But what demonic whisper had told her this plastic timekeeper, seemingly unsold from the Lillian Vernon Spring 1983 catalogue, would inspire envy, Beth could not figure. &quot;The black sheep jumps over the white picket fence every time the second hand passes the six. And it plays a song too! Can you believe it?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, it's pretty amazing.&quot; Home On the Deranged was more like it, thought Beth. &quot;How much did it cost?&quot; She had seen something similar at every ninety-nine cent store in the nation, but truck drivers and strippers in crisis have no time for bargain hunting.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Only $75. I figured I deserved a little treat, and with the money I make in Jackson I'll definitely be able to get my gumball machine up and running. I just couldn't resist, it's soooo me.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacqueline had recently been offered a percentage of a jumbo gumball machine franchise, the kind of machine you see throughout the mid west in shopping malls and airport terminals. Most of the other &quot;features&quot; and similarly brilliant retirement plans: Sara St. Claire was investing in erotic toothbrush distribution, while Jasmine St. Steele put her earnings into okra based lubricating gel. Jackie was going to shed some D'light on gumball chewers everywhere, but not before her collection of Beanie Babies and oddly shaped air fresheners was complete. Showing Beth the rest of her purchases, it seemed this shopping spree had put her one step closer to her dream.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I can't wait to show Quince. He'll just love the clock I'm sure.&quot; He would do just that, silently thought Beth, being as lazy with his cruelty as he was and this being such an obvious cry for attention. Quince was a chiseled tightrope walker training for the circus at clown college in Pensacola, Fl. Jacqueline had seen him on Royal St. wearing green and yellow striped tights during Mardi Gras and decided he'd make the ideal eccentric accessory. But Quince was gay, a fact he somehow kept hidden from Jacqueline while enjoying her over the top performances: the seductive towel falling casually from her chest at a common friend's house were they both stayed that weekend (he coincidentally, she obviously), the &quot;noise outside&quot; that brought her to his bed that evening, and the dramatic twists of her body as she slept, brushing up against his genitals just slightly, but to no avail. Something else to &quot;work harder&quot; for, she thought.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacqueline sat proudly for a moment before realizing Beth's quiet came from the seat next to her. Unsure if her roadie's silence was in awe of the great clock or in ignorance to it's value, Jacqueline threw Beth a bone and said, &quot;You can go tinkle if you want, McDonald's doesn't open for another twenty minutes and I want to get a McMuffin.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll just take some change for a tampon&hellip;&quot;as she reached for the beverage holder filled with coins, Jacqueline squealed like a senile cockatoo, shocked that such a suggestion had been offered for using the leftovers saved from each broken dollar bill, looking forward to a guilt free purchase someday with this spare change fund.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Noooooooo, no, no! No change! Take paper bills! And bring me the coins back!&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay, okay. Sorry, I'll use the bills and buy a whole box.&quot; Beth didn't want to upset her chances of riding up front any further. &quot;Do you have enough tea?&quot; Arizona Green Teas always calmed Jacqueline, the high fructose corn syrup ignored above the words &quot;ginseng&quot; and &quot;fresh brewed.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Are you still using tampons?&quot; Jacqueline couldn't fathom wasting $5-$10 a month for something as easily folded out of the free toilet paper in public restrooms. Though this she only did when performing, she preferred to ignore such a common feminine trait, and bled freely on her clothes, which she ended up having to replace anyway.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beth used the restroom and bought two bottles of tea. She returned to the van and the front seat. They picked apart Egg McMuffins to fit them into the Zone diet plan and drove on. They drove past fields of green kudzu and valleys of rolling smoke, past whistling family campers, past riverboat casinos and cigarette warehouses, past deer, and nutria, and cicada. For Jacqueline, every new booking meant the chance of being discovered by some Hollywood movie producer coincidentally in town on business. And it was a chance at having a real classy dressing room, something she fantasized was possible, though had hardly ever been offered more than a broom closet to change in. At least it wasn't shared space with the house girls, whom she felt she was much better than, inside and out. No matter what the dressing room looked like, she always managed to devise some way to appear surrounded by decadence in the staged pre show Polaroid she had Beth take each night, just in case an A&amp;E biography would someday share this moment with the world. While Jacqueline ignored the local dancers, Beth looked forward to meeting the characters each club produced backstage without fail, chatting often with girls as they dry shaved spread eagle about their Christian Country singing aspirations, the peccadillo's of local Mayor, judge, and elementary school principal, and what it felt like to be a grandmother at thirty four.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't look like Jacqueline would be discovered in Jackson, however. The club sat back on a gravel plot opposite railroad tracks from a rundown package store advertising Boar's Head meats and Pearl Lager. It appeared to have been built around an abandoned train car, one side squarely formed out of stucco was attached to the actual end car of a train. From the faded sketch of fishnet stockings below a heart shaped buttocks, the words &quot;Caboose Club&quot; sat in paint with an excitement that contradicted the chipped plaster fa&ccedil;ade of the building. Swamp weeds grew quietly around its base and on in all directions as far as they could see, and somewhere nearby a paper mill sent steam through the already sticky air, smelling of cotton candy and asphalt. Jacqueline's eyes strained to keep the disappointment from further lining her brow. Sensing her boss needed some help getting motivated, Beth started towards the door, ajar under a &quot;B.Y.O.B.&quot; sign that meant the club was fully nude. She heard Jacqueline moan slightly as they entered; apparently her booker neglected to mention this part of the contract. Immediately to the right of the entrance, an obese man dressed in a black t shirt and black Cavarichi's sat behind the glass window of an office, so thick with cigar smoke that it was hard to make out its furnishings. Seeing Beth enter first he smiled, feeling lucky to have booked such a fresh girl. His smile exposed a missing tooth lost to the cigars. He wore three thick gold chains around his neck, each one carrying a diamond studded machine gun charm. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, you must be Jacqueline D'Light, I'm delighted to meet you.&quot; The club owner stuck out his tobacco stained hand to Beth, and she shook it, not knowing how to correct his mistake. His Brooklyn accent was a surprise to hear in Mississippi, and the sound of it called Jacqueline to action, correcting him seductively, and laughing off the confusion as though it was the most ridiculous thing she ever heard.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Clammy!!! Yo Clammy come 'ere! Help these ladies to the boxcar!&quot; He beckoned the aid of the most striking bar lackey seen in all of the women's experience. Every club had their mascot, the one guy there each night that did odd jobs for food and beer, having state supported income and nothing better to do. Clammy, Beth later found out from the house girls, was suspected to be the product of inbreeding. His wiry, shoulderless arms uncovered by his sleeveless sweatshirt revealed several applications of temporary tattoos, varying in age and origin, some Cracker Jack, some free from the package store across the tracks in support of Southern Comfort's newest ad campaign. He was bald, and his mouth bulged with teeth as big as piano keys that wobbled individually like a calliope when he spoke, which he did nonstop and without embarrassment. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ya'll gonna do fine here tonight. We had Paisely Parton here once, and Paisely Parton lemme draw her pitcher, and she did real good seein' how she lemme point out the guys with dough and all. So I'll letcha know ok? Just ask Clammy and he'll tell ya ladies, he will.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All righty,&quot; said Jacqueline, intrigued by the mention of Dolly Parton's third cousin, twice removed. Clammy walked them through the club that looked as nice as any strip joint could in daylight, and stopped in front the door to their dressing room. Hope filled Jacqueline like an awkward gas bubble, unsure if she should smile or clench her jaw upon seeing the faded gold paper star taped to the door. She reasoned that if the Caboose Club had been able to lure a top name like Paisely Parton, they must at least offer their featured dancers professional dressing rooms. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey Jacqueline, I think this would make a good Polaroid,&quot; joked Beth, amused that the inverted pentagram had such an effect on her boss. But Jacqueline didn't notice the condescension, too excited by what she might find behind that door. A gold mirror? A velvet couch? She crossed her fingers as Clammy opened the door without suspense, shuffling their luggage on top of the tiny card table and pulling the string of the bare overhead light to reveal, yet again, a plain square box.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All right ya'll, first shows at six. I'm gonna help ya I promise. Just you wait'n see.&quot; Straight to business, hoping to avoid a meltdown, Beth asked Jacqueline which number she wanted to perform first. When Jacqueline didn't answer, she unpacked a large pile of black leather from one of the bags Clammy had set on the table. From the van's cooler she fetched two cans of Readi Whip, and stopped by the DJ booth to cue &quot;2001: A Space odyssey&quot; on their mix CD. Returning to the dressing room, she found Jacqueline in the same position, slumped in front of the foolish clock she had brought in with her props. The sheep jumped the fence at six, then again, and again, until Beth was sure at 5:50pm that Jacqueline was not going to get dressed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Jacqueline? Are you going to get ready?&quot; Nothing. She asked her again, using a weapon reserved only for emergencies such as this. &quot;Molly? Hello? Are you going to change?&quot; Still no answer. Clammy knocked softly on the door.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ya'll 'bout ready?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sure thing!&quot; replied Beth, suddenly overwhelmed with a stroke of genius. She took off her shirt, and started rummaging through the feathers and corsets in Jacqueline's wardrobe trunk, declaring, &quot;Well, somebody has to do it. Might as well be me. Hell, they thought I was you anyway! Who'll know the difference?&quot; Just then the black sheep let out a feeble &quot;baaaaah&quot; and Home on the Range began to play. Fastening an ill fitting corset over her small sports bra Beth continued, &quot;I bet Kitty Rodriguez would love to see this, wouldn't you agree Molly?&quot; Sure enough Jacqueline sat up.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I told you never to call me Molly!&quot; Jacqueline hated her birth name, and wasn't about to give up the few moments of a long, exhausting day, when she really was a star.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still wearing the corset, Beth grabbed the leather pile, the whipped topping, and a plastic drop cloth and headed out the door. As the house girl finished her dance, she lay down the drop cloth and set the large pile off to the right, exposing a long extension cord, which she plugged into the wall behind her. She winked at the dj, and slowly, to the rising sound of the dawn of time, the black leather pile began to grow, shaping into the from of a giant penis and balls, large as a horse, which Jacqueline, now appearing in costume from behind the stage, mounted and caressed as the music switched to Wagner's &quot;Ride of the Valkyries.&quot; She rode the giant penis as if her life depended on it, flipping back her hair, pouting flirtatiously at the thin crowd of construction workers gathered around the stage, until an enormous clash of thunder in the music signaled her reach towards the cans of whipped cream, which she sprayed on the men as the musical crescendo came to its end.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning back to the dressing room, the two women sat in silence as Jacqueline handed Beth a Readi Whip, having saved just enough gas in each can for one breath a piece. Jacqueline knew Beth would never have danced in her place. She still wasn't comfortable with her height, which Jacqueline admired (being only five foot two), though she had never complemented her on it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You know, Kitty Rodriguez is one of the best managers there is. She really liked you. I bet we could track down her number again if you ever wanted to give her a call.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beth thought for a minute before answering.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Naaa, I don't think so. But I have an idea. I might want to open a store when we get back to San Diego. Maybe you could help me?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What kind of store would that be?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A gift shop, something small, where we could sell all our truck stop finds. You know, turquoise jewelry, velvet paintings, funny belt buckles, stuff like that. There's nothing like that in Encinitas.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And what would you call this truck stop theme store?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I was thinking I'd call it Home On the Deranged.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Home on the Deranged&hellip;I like that idea.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They both smiled, closed their eyes, and inhaled the remaining nitrous oxide, falling, through a vivid chrysanthemum, into a deep fuchsia lotus, and on through a night filled with gold paper stars as her clock once again played &quot;Home on the Range.&quot; <br></td>
