      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sylvan Lambert wasn't the kind of man who'd bet on a losing horse. Sure, he was rich-rich enough to own one of the best suites in Manhattan-and maybe he was a little too flashy with his money for the standards of good taste, but what red-blooded man in his prime wouldn't spring for shiny new cars and dinners at Restaurant Le Roi if he could afford it? Sylvan had been raised in luxury, the child of the private-yacht-and-servants social class. His life read like a social column in a downtown daily, and that was how he liked it. One thing he didn't like was his trouble over Polly-he'd purged her from his life, but her memory, a force in itself, couldn't be dismissed so easily.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sylvan was lying next to Roxy Swann, the wrong-side-of-the-tracks dizzy-blond actress who was just starting to see her star rise, onscreen in Hollywood and onstage in New York City, after a couple of years of bawdy dancehall acts she hoped no one remembered. She was a fast talker and a no-nonsense lover, and when Sylvan had sent his chauffeur into her dressing room with the requisite dozen red roses she'd been only too happy to warm his plush bed. Sylvan's blurred vision sharpened itself into focus to reveal Roxy's midnight glamour reduced to smudgy black-ringed eyes and frizzy bleached curls. A slight gag of distaste rose in his throat, not too unusual for the morning clarity that inevitably came after a late-night, cheap-sheets-and-champagne romp. Sylvan hadn't had a truly satisfying encounter with a woman since he'd cozied up for six months with Polly Rue, one of those newfangled New York career-minded gals-she was a rising journalist with the Times-with the gumption to stand up to a man while oozing feminine allure from every pore. She had a certain something, a core of true character, that the anything-goes modern girls of the day seemed to lack-he remembered the way she'd raise a glass of champagne to him with a smile and give a toast &quot;to work and to play&quot;. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sylvan brushed Polly from his mind with the easy drape of a smooth silk dress shirt around his shoulders. His practiced hands swiftly nudged every button through its buttonhole as Roxy lifted one droopy eyelid. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey-what gives?&quot; she rasped out like a sleep-addled floozy after a long night at the speakeasies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Look dame, I'm gone. You can get yourself some breakfast if you want-just ring the kitchen and charge it to my credit,&quot; Sylvan scowled. &quot;And make sure you make yourself look halfway decent before anyone sees you.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roxy stuck her celebrated button nose in the air and pulled the silk sheets up to her shoulders. &quot;Okay mister-you bet I'll have a nice big breakfast right here.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sylvan was already out of the room; Roxy's only reply was the slam of the door behind him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An hour later Sylvan sat tensely in his box at the tracks, watching the sleek horses chase each other around in their unending circle. He looked over the results of recent races, studying the names and the numbers. Sylvan never bet on a losing horse because he made it his business to know who the winning horses were-and he bet only on horses he was sure of. This skill was a mix of careful observation and unfailing instinct. He had been teaching Polly which characteristics the winning horses had in common-the way to spot one: a certain arch in the neck that indicated spirit, the prance in the box of a horse with the will to win, the carriage of the body that showed the horse felt a connection with his jockey-and she had been more interested in the horses than he'd ever expected from a woman. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment he was studying the progress of a charger called Winner's Choice and its jockey, who wore the lucky color purple, when a sudden impulse grabbed him-he rushed over to the telephone, picked up the receiver, and asked the operator for a number. His butler came on the wire after a moment of static. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Gray-have a dozen roses delivered to Madeleine Jacobs tonight, and bring the car round for her outside her theater at about eleven. And have the bedroom freshened up-very good, Gray, that's all.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This daily chore completed, he relaxed back into the velvet seat in his box. He felt his mind free of worry, when-so gradually as to be almost imperceptible-an angry vertical line worked its way up between his two furrowed brows. His mind succumbed to the memory of that impassioned day a month ago-his final day with Polly.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You wouldn't leave if you had half a brain, Sylvan Lambert! I'm the best damn thing you've ever had, I'm sure of it, and you may not realize it now-&quot; Polly paused, before hissing, &quot;but down the road you'll wish you had a quality woman instead of a pack of pathetic memories of drunken painted-up flapper girls with rips in their stockings and one-way train tickets. You don't know the difference between real feeling and greedy using.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sylvan remembered the snapping green eyes and the accusatory pointed finger. He replayed the scene in his mind like a picture show in the theater.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Look Polly, dames are all alike. A man's got to get what he needs and know his limit. Well, my limit's up. I've got to keep myself open for the next winner. It's like a race-one horse can only win for so long.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sylvan felt a twinge of shame at the remembrance of this reply, and he tried to brush it off like he would a mosquito in his collar on a summer day. But the memory lingered with him, buzzing for attention in his ear. He remembered vividly the broken look on Polly's face, and her struggle to hold back tears as she'd jumped from his car into the biting night air of a New York winter night. The last silent scene of this mental picture show was the image of Polly silhouetted against a streetlamp in front of her drab brick apartment building, her handbag clutched in one white hand, the other half-raised in a gesture of defeat and good-bye. Sylvan remembered how nonchalantly he'd turned away, and he clutched his fist involuntarily, frustrated at the memory.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sylvan twitched his jacket over his broad shoulders. One hand clutched the knee of his gray wool trousers while the other ran through his trim blond hair. He remembered the way Polly's long brown hair would mingle with his when their heads met on the pillow, and that specific moment when, half in shadow and half illuminated by the moonlight pooling through the window, their bodies would feel like two halves of the same whole. Sylvan wondered what could have made him forget that feeling-the paltry excitement offered by a different woman every night?-the freedom to care only for himself, without having to concern himself with Polly's finely-tuned feelings? He suspected wincingly just how pathetic his reasons were. He remembered, driving away from Polly that night, that he'd told himself there were plenty more horses in the stable. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sylvan's next hours were occupied with attempts to drown his thoughts-in activity at the track, cocktails at his club, and dinner at Le Roi-but his movements were all mechanical, his efforts useless. His day, like every other, was made up of a collection of familiar habits, but they failed to work their soothing effect when in every handshake he felt Polly's firm grip, in every smile he saw her vivacity, and in every sigh he felt her warm tears on that cold night fall like ice on his conscience.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At ten-thirty that night Sylvan slumped into the backseat of his car. Ferguson, his chauffeur, glanced back at him in the mirror.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sir, evening paper's on the seat next to you&hellip;bit of bad news tonight, from the looks of it.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sylvan nodded and placed a hand on the periodical in question. He doubted if its pages could hold any interest for him tonight, with the turmoiled state his mind was in. After a few moments of silence, Sylvan wearily closed his fingers around the paper and raised it to reading level. His eyes seemed to focus and un-focus several times as he stared at the black headline slicing across the white paper.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Journalist Polly Rue Dead In Auto Wreck&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sylvan's mind rocketed through a replay of the last seven months. His hands gripped the sides of his head; it felt as if it would whirl itself off his neck.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of a sudden-everything was still again. The car drew near to Sylvan's building, and the night-drenched streets looked serene. Sylvan knew Madeleine Jacobs was waiting for him in his room. He knew a lifetime of Madeleine Jacobses awaited him, and he looked into the future, for a moment, and saw the hopeless entirety of it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Gray-have a dozen roses delivered to Polly Rue tonight&hellip;&quot;</td>
