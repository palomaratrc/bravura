      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shane says, &quot;what!?&quot; in that incredulous way Shane does, then takes a sip of his coffee and shakes his head.
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call Zach to let him know, and his wife only hears his half of the conversation. &quot;Who killed himself?! Who are you talking about?!&quot; She socks him when she find out it's &quot;only some author&quot;, a punitive response for scaring the hell out of her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;His son found him,&quot; Nicole tells me. &quot;Had to walk in and find his dad all shot and dead.&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carmina text messages me. &quot;Hunter Thompson shot himself.&quot; I type my brief response (I heard) and hit send.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shane and I joke that somewhere in Colorado, a drug dealer is out of business. Then I go home and fall asleep.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Hohman says that when writing about literature one must always use the present tense, &quot;because we like to think that these things are always happening, and always have been happening, since the text was first written.&quot; She pauses to reflect on the depth of her statement, then smiles. &quot;Isn't that a wonderful idea?&quot;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunter S. Thompson is all shot and dead, but on page 145 he's ordering a tall glass of rum, with ice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I glance at photos from his funeral and see Johnny Depp and John Cusack dressed in designer black, flecked with snow. I see a hoard of police cars outside his house, and read a beautiful article on all his achievements. But still he's ordering that tall glass of rum, on page 145, with ice. He's hating Nixon and having the shit beat out of him by Hell's Angels. In ten years he'll be just bones, an eerie skeleton covered by six feet of earth, and he'll be lighting a cigarette and dodging bats, and ordering a tall glass of rum with ice, inhaling the whole cigarette and using the butt to light another, covered completely by dirt, in a casket in Colorado, nothing but bones.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in one hundred years, when I'm all dead and nothing but bones, some sixteen-year-old fucker will pick up an old book. He'll hate school and hate the world and be too intimidated to read anything 'legitimate'. And the worms that ate Hunter S. Thompson will have given birth to eight thousand generations of worms, and he'll be leaving a conference at a Las Vegas hotel and walking into the bar while lighting up a cigarette and ordering a tall glass of rum, with ice.</p></td>
