      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The train was running late. She should have been at Gare Saint Lazare station twenty minutes ago. She felt no certainty that he would still be there faithfully waiting for her. Could he be faithful?
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was early. Two days early from a month long vacation with family in Wales. She would surprise him, with a kiss at first, and then a long embrace. She would smell his hair and feel his warmth. She missed him. Everything would be better from now on. Could it be better?</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peering faces bobbed up and down along the station's platform as the train slowed and came to a gradual stop. He found himself uncontrollably bobbing as well as he searched through passenger windows. He had realized that he was in love after all. He had to tell her. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The train's passageway was crowded with exiting Parisian locals and tourists from anywhere. She was eager to see him, but took her time to get off the train. A few seconds more wouldn't make a difference. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He briefly focused on each passing face. Soon his search narrowed to long blond hair and then to moist red lips, the lips that would connect to his before he could say a word. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She weaved her way through the station's platform with thoughts of what she would tell him when they reunited. The passionate kiss shared by the couple in front of her was close to what she would say. She watched, entranced, until suddenly she felt an ice cold feeling of recognition mixed with horror: the hands moving through long blond hair, the coat he was wearing&hellip; his shape. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They kissed and embraced. He wanted to say everything. But time passed and the unsaid words slowly faded away. And then he saw her, just feet away, watching them, unmoving like a statue. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood paralyzed, unable to move. A loud whistle blew, followed shortly by a train attendant calling for &quot;all aboard.&quot; She stepped back slowly and then faster, still unable to look away from his gaze. She stumbled back unto the train just before its wheels slowly began turning.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The train departed Gare Saint Lazare station, late to its next destination.</p></td>
