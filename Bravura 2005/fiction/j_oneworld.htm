&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace to me means the freedom to teach, to show someone you care or let them know your aware, is peace to you relaxing on a beach, drinking a beer or smoking trees <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me peace is a feeling inside, having a place to run when your scared or confused and you want to hide<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace to me is being able to comfort a friend, your family, a child, or a wife, having someone who cares beside you in life, feeling freedom in the land you live, not wanting more out of life but to give<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way for the world to survive, is to somehow find peace between you and I, you and I meaning worlds to worlds, countries to countries, cultures to cultures <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If peace is not found this world cannot and will not survive, we must come to the conclusion that all are free, no one has say over you or me, how we treat each other lies on our own shoulders, learn to coincide together or the world will get colder<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know if I die today I will have peace, cause inside my heart I truly feel free, no living being can break me enough to tarnish my soul, I only feel sadness for the hearts who have taken the toll<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pray that this world will learn to have peace, not peace won by war or politics or fake George Bush, but peace won by the hearts of innocent man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is peace to you and I, this should be peace between you and I, all that I ask is that you let me die in peace, oh please oh please let us have peace</td>
