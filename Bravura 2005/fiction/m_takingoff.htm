He was enchanted by the idea of a real big city, the romanticism of the entire eastern sea board. The intrigue of the west coast was completely gone for him, taken away by the beats and hippies, leaving in their wake the exposed bones of California's spiritual carcass. But he was going to New York. New York meant endless possibilities. He spent the night before the trip packing and getting everything ready. It had been raining for four days. Not real rain, just the windy California mist. The kind that dries before it hits the ground except for the few stray drops that create dusty marbles on dirt roads. The kind that leaves your car dirty, because it gets just wet enough for all the dirt swirling around to latch on to it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't forget your journal, and pack plenty of warm clothes. It's going to be cold,&quot; his mother yelled to him from the bottom of the stairs. He poked his head out the door and waved at her. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I want to take a look at your journal when you get back.&quot; He didn't understand why she wanted him to bring the journal so bad. Most of it was incoherent notes; things that sparked thoughts within him. But he was uninhibited in the journal. Showing his journal to his mother would be the same as selling drugs to a cop. Who wants their child to believe they're a writer anyway? Besides, no one else could understand it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank Hemingway pulled up in Joyce's driveway, coming to a screeching halt inches from the garage door. He bounded up the walk and rang the doorbell. Frank and Joyce had been friends for a few years by this point. They had a lot of friends. Friends from different circles they didn't really fit into. They preferred each other's company, being best friends and all that jazz. Frank didn't read much. But he drew and painted. He thought he was the greatest. No one could compare to him. Because Frank thought this, he tatooed his skin himself. Frank had just painted his left shoulder in dark permanent ink. The tattoo depicted an angel driving a javelin through a demon. He took every chance he could to take his shirt off. In his head girls swooned and men cowered. Mostly, people just asked how long it took and where he got it done. It really was beautiful work. Joyce thought the tattoo was ridiculous. Frank was no evangelist. He didn't even think Frank believed in God. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyce's dad answered the door. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ya know Frank. You don't need to ring the doorbell anymore. You're practically family,&quot; he said, throwing his arm around Frank's shoulder and bringing him into the living room where the rest of Joyce's family waited. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyce's little sister sat Indian style on the floor. His brother sat on the couch leaning over with his head in his hand, breathing prolonged sighs, just wanting for everyone to leave so he could get back to the girls and parties of his senior year in high school. Joyce's mother stood up and gave a Frank a hug. Joyce sat on top of his bag. He was ready to go.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You two are going to have so much fun in New York. I wish I could drive you to the airport, but I have work in an hour,&quot; said Joyce's mother.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's fine, Mrs. Lawler. Mr. Lawler will take good care of us,&quot; Frank assured her.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You two are going to visit your friend Cassondra, right?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, mom,&quot; Joyce chimed in.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And she's that black girl right?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;African American, Mom.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She's very pretty isn't she, Joyce?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She's beautiful, Mom. But I'd be talking to Frank about that kind of stuff, okay?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh really?&quot; Joyce saw his mom start to smile. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, really.&quot;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cassondra Bird was a different bird all together. The kind of person Joyce could only love subconsciously. She stood about 5' 11&quot;. She had deep brown eyes, oak colored skin and a hip, shoulder length layered haircut. Walking, talking pop culture. She knew more about 80s pop music, 70s sitcoms and mainstream rap than anyone. She was beautiful and used it to her advantage. She was friends with everyone. This made Joyce jealous. They weren't entirely close, but their brother and sister relationship might have grown into something more if they liked each other enough. They fought over the direction of each other&rsquo;s lives, new music, books and what to do on any given night. Their fights ended in either confessions or hysterical laughter and never lasted long. Cassondra and Frank got along quite well. Frank was everyone's man and she was everyone's girl. When together, they could only see each other. Joyce and Frank met her at a party thrown by Sippy Hesse, the self-proclaimed king of rock &lsquo;n roll in their small town. They all sat in Hesse's backyard and smoked cigarettes and sipped off plastic cups of whiskey and coke. Cassondra had been blown away by the scene. She flew around following hipsters up and down stairs on wings of drunken ecstasy. Since then she had been inducted into the group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyce's mother winked at Frank. Frank blushed and ducked his head toward the tile floor. Joyce's mother was the only person who could make Frank blush. Joyce and Frank both picked up their bags and brought them to the car. They went back inside and said their final goodbyes to the rest of the family then piled into Joyce's dad&rsquo;s new FT150 pickup. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truck was only about a month old. It still had that new car smell. The seats were leather and sticky. They made an obnoxious creak whenever you moved on them. Joyce's dad constantly screamed at Joyce's little sister who slid back and forth on the seat giggling. The seats tickled her legs and the noise they made brought a smile to her face. Joyce thought it was beautiful that even though she was twelve she still maintained that incredibly innocent and childish view of life. He wished that he could have held on to his innocence a little longer. He tried to pinpoint the exact time or memory that changed him; the first time he became a horny little teenager. He didn't trust his memory.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They drove down the freeway just over the speed limit. Joyce's father drove like this everywhere. He was always either the fastest man in the slow lane or the slowest in the fast lane. He always complained about how people drove like assholes. When they reached the drop-off curb, he stretched across the seat to give Joyce a forceful hug. His father was affectionate, but only in dire situations. He kept his composure under all circumstances. Joyce thought it funny that he'd never seen him cry. Joyce cried all the time. He wondered who he got it from. Joyce and Frank stepped from the car and stood in the road, waving goodbye silently like parade princesses. Waving goodbye as their only fan drifted away from them. Joyce stood there nervous and shaking, suddenly feeling the urge to have a cigarette. He pulled two from the pack, gave one to Frank, then stuck the other in his mouth. The air was cold and windy and added to his shaking. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Geez, Joyce, give it up,&quot; Frank said dragging on his cigarette, inhaling deeply then letting the smoke drift out of nose. Frank's father was in the Navy. He'd been born in Manila and had been back and forth across the nation more than a few times. He kept telling Joyce the plane ride wasn't scary but still, Joyce's hands trembled as he tried to raise a match to his cigarette. It took him several tries but he eventually lit it. Frank stood in front of him to block the wind.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's really not that scary,&quot; Frank said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, well, I've only been on one flight before. And the whole time I held my mother&rsquo;s hand.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My first flight alone was when I was twelve.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So?&quot; Joyce said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Toughen up.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Shut the hell up,&quot; Joyce said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank laughed heartily at Joyce, and then started walking towards the endless grey terminal. &quot;Ha ha ha. All right, I guess there's no convincing you. We part ways from here. Have a nice flight.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank's last minute decision to got to New York with Joyce resulted in flights on two different airlines, so they were stuck in their prospective terminals waiting solemnly for the flight to be called. Joyce sprawled out uncomfortably in a stiff blue chair for what felt like hours. The clock said he had forty five minutes left. He had to get up. He paced back and forth, sliding his feet across the smooth carpet. He then ventured through the terminal watching faces and checking the times and places of different flights. He looked like a gypsy dragging his carry-on luggage. He watched a Mexican family heading to Chicago. He stood far off from them hiding behind the small airport chairs. He imagined he was watching a herd of lions and listened to them speak in a language he didn't understand. He smiled as the two younger children fumbled with a pi&ntilde;ata that resembled Spiderman. He thought it beautiful how they skipped through airport, their little brown hands clutching the confettied icon. He kept walking around. He saw a 9:50 PM flight headed for Quebec. He thought how funny it would be if he just transferred his ticket for Canada then boarded the flight with just what he had in his carry-on. He dreamed of getting off the plane and wrapping his face in his scarf and using the French he had learned in high school; the French everyone told him he would never use. He would get lost for ten years and come back home with stories and knowledge he wouldn't have dreamed of learning. He stood there daydreaming. Suddenly, a calm soothing voice filled the air with drowsy euphoria as it came over the loud speaker, &quot;Flight 105 non stop service to New York is now boarding.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rushed back towards his terminal. His stomach began to tie itself in knots. He'd been on a plane once, a forty-five minute flight to Santa Cruz. He felt the same way before that flight. Now he strolled slowly up to the ticket booth dragging his feet in baby steps. He hoped that if he walked slow enough the plane might just leave and he'd be left there inching toward the entrance with the eyes of the airport employees boring into him with frustration. He handed off his ticket to a machine, squeezed his way into the plane and was greeted by three smiling blonde flight attendants. One of them looked him in the eyes and said, &quot;Welcome to South West Airlines.&quot; Joyce nodded and made his way to his seat. He ended up having a whole row to himself. He took the window seat and stretched out towards the walkway. Looking out the window he was in awe as the baggage carts rushed by and the strange men in the orange jumpsuits orchestrated planes in every direction with lit up batons, composing grandiose symphonies of aeronautical miracles. He threw on his head phones; pulled out a bag of medicine his mom had given him for his cold and popped three Nyquil. The plane stood still, resting on its rubber haunches prepared for takeoff. The plane soon crawled down the runway and Joyce's heart felt like it was clenched in his teeth. He stared out the window, wide-eyed as the hulking piece of metal ascended. The city grew smaller and smaller. He became lost in the street lamps and homes as they became blood cells within the veins of the city, this gigantic living breathing entity with some great exposed circulatory system, not covered until the clouds became its thin layer of skin. He thought &quot;This is how blood must feel as it leaves the body.&quot; then the plane broke through the cloud coverage into a different atmosphere and he felt his eyes become heavy. Joyce was asleep before the flight left California. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shaken awake as the plane began to descend. Startled by the jolt, he looked down at his hands, touched his face and made sure he was alive. He was in a new time zone, a new dimension. He gripped the arm rests firmly. The plane descended. And there were no problems.<br>
