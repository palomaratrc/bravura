      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I used to come here with my babysitter when I was little,&quot; he said as he pulled his lime green Volkswagen into the parking lot of a tiny playground. The clock's purple digital numbers changed from 10:50 to 10:51. I wondered if they would turn to blinking eight&rsquo;s if the car&rsquo;s battery died. &quot;I think I&rsquo;ll just sit here awhile. Maybe I will remember how it felt.&quot; I stared at him wondering what went on in his head and how his disorder could distort the way he saw himself so greatly. He touched his dark brown hair, getting used to the new cut. I quickly looked away, not wanting to cause him discomfort. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why do you think they make playgrounds so colorful?&quot; I asked, studying the yellow and red hues in the metal rods welded together to make fun play fixtures. He pondered the question for a few short seconds and looked me in the eye, something he didn&rsquo;t do often.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I guess because little kids like bright colors.&quot; An answer anyone but me could have easily come up with. I wondered why I didn&rsquo;t think like most people, why every simple concept had to be made so complex in my mind. I leaned forward and looked up at the sky from the windshield, hoping to see the perforated stars pasted from my perfect empyrean into the black night sky. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No stars,&quot; I sighed in discontent. He reached his right arm up and twisted a small tan knob that opened the sunroof. I envied the veins in his hands and the way they were allowed to be a part of his every day life. He casually looked up to the clouded heavens. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No stars,&quot; he confirmed. He reclined his seat and I felt his eyes burning holes in my side, but I didn't look at him. I couldn&rsquo;t look at him. A simple crush turned into another complex situation for me, a wounded bird syndrome of sorts. When someone sees a wounded bird lying in its nest, they feel compelled to pick it up and help it, mend its wing, feed it worms, whatever will make them healthy again. Whatever will set them free. I had the same feelings for him as I did a wounded bird. I wanted to help him. I wanted to set him free. &quot;I&rsquo;m tired,&quot; he whispered. I turned to him, placed my cold hands on his shoulders and shook him delicately. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;WAKE UP!&quot; I teased. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I&rsquo;m awake, I&rsquo;m awake,&quot; he assured me. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&rdquo; I tried to think of something to save us from the silence that was holding us both hostage, &ldquo;Tell me a story,&quot; I laughed. He thought for a moment and closed his eyes. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don&rsquo;t have stories. I don&rsquo;t do anything.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My voice turned serious and I wondered if he truly believed that he had nothing of importance to say, &quot;You have stories. Tell me anything.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment, &quot;when I was four or five my step-brothers and I would ride our bikes everywhere. And I loved riding a bike, but there was this one hill that we were so afraid of. I mean, it was just a street but it was really scary to us. I don&rsquo;t know why. Well, one day we decided we'd attempt it. And everyone made it but me. I crashed and got hurt and it made a big scar above my lip.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Can you still see it?&quot; I asked. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; he rubbed the scar with this pointer finger, &quot;right here.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A scar story,&quot; I whispered while reclining my seat to the same spot as his. He closed his eyes and I studied his face, something I couldn&rsquo;t do when he was looking. The shininess of his distinguished nose and chiseled chin. The smoothness of his lips, the bottom bigger than the top, opposite of mine. I heard the solitude of his spirit in his breaths. &quot;He remembers how it felt,&quot; I said in my mind. He opened his eyes, staring me straight back in the face. If we were in a movie, this would be the perfect time to kiss, our faces just three inches apart. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don&rsquo;t stare at me,&quot; he said. I jokingly opened my eyes wider and inched in closer. &quot;Please don't,&quot; he begged in the same tone of voice he used when he was pleading with me to not take his picture. I wondered if he believed like ancient people, that pictures took part of your soul. I quickly turned my head and sat up, shielding my eyes from his view.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fine,&quot; I huffed, cursing filmmakers and their distorted view of reality. We sat in silence, the clocks numbers the only moving things in the car. 11:23.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What are you thinking about?&quot; he asked me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to tell him. I wanted to tell him that I was thinking about his anxiety. His fear of people. His fear of being looked at. I wanted to tell him that I was thinking about kissing him and wondering what his reaction would be if I did it. I wanted to tell him that I didn't want him to leave and go back to New York, where he had moved to just a few short months ago. That I wanted him to stay here and be with me and make me feel special and confused all at once, which he had a unique way of doing. I wanted to tell him that I could cure him. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at him again and took a deep breath, &quot;I&rsquo;m not thinking about anything...&quot;<strong></strong></p></td>
