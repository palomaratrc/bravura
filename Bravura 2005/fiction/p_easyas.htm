      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know those people that say they just sort of &ldquo;fell&rdquo; into their profession? Yeah, you know whom I&rsquo;m talking about. <em>Those</em> people, the ones that litter the late-night television shows while you sit on your couch with potato chip crumbs on your shirt that was once white&hellip;hmmm&hellip;I should do my laundry. The people you stare vacantly at, your eyes just seem to fixate on them and you can still hear the faucet dripping. I&rsquo;ll have to get that fixed. Those people make me angry. I get so angry at them because they sit there in their fancy clothes with their hair glistening and teeth white as the God-given snow (quite unlike that of my shirt) and they tell us that their current project is so great and it&rsquo;s the best they&rsquo;ve ever seen. Funny&hellip;they said that the last thirteen times they were on the show. I remember because once she wore a pink blouse&hellip;it was her first time on the show, a nobody at the time&hellip;now she&rsquo;s being paid a hell of a lot just to flaunt those breasts on camera. I think she&rsquo;s a chicken just for doing it. Fantastic. We watch these people and have that love-hate relationship with them. They capture you and draw you so close to them that you can see that mole on his chin. Yuck, I&rsquo; m not a fan of moles. He&rsquo;s got some makeup on it at least. It&rsquo;s like a flesh colored bump now &ndash; flesh colored bumps &ndash; this is what fascinates us? I don&rsquo;t understand our society sometimes. Why do I sit here night after night after night&hellip;I&rsquo;m just looking at these people, listening to them market this current thing that they&rsquo;re doing to me so that I&rsquo;ll rush out and support them. Not this time! No sir-ee! It&rsquo;s just not going to happen. They&rsquo;ve suckered me in so many times and every time I&rsquo;m disappointed with them. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think that maybe it hurts to smile so much? Ooo&hellip;she&rsquo;s got a lump of Vaseline on her teeth. Ha-ha. She deserves it&hellip;maybe that&rsquo;ll teach the m not to do close-ups. If they&rsquo;re trying to make these people seem appealing, they&rsquo;re not roping me on in. Whatever happened to test patterns? Maybe I could actually fall asleep that way and not be glued to this drivel. Trash!!!! It&rsquo;s all trash! Just look at me, a dreamy-eyed moron with my eyes glossed over. Oh they hurt. I&rsquo;ll bet they&rsquo;re all red now. Where&rsquo;s my Visine? Forget it, I&rsquo; m not getting up. How can I miss a single second of this? This garbage that I constantly need and crave&hellip;I blame my insomnia really. Seventeen months&hellip;that&rsquo;s a long time for no sleep. Well, lets be honest &ndash; I do get sleep. An hour and a half average every forty-eight hours is about it. Look at them prancing about. Ugh, how degrading. They are a spectacle of gargantuan proportions &ndash; what a life. I should have such a life! If they can do it, anyone can! That&rsquo;s what they claim anyway &ndash; of course I don&rsquo;t quite believe it myself. But who knows? Maybe I&rsquo;m wrong. No, of course not. I&rsquo;m right, they&rsquo;re wrong. It&rsquo;s never as easy as it looks, if it were, everyone <em>could</em> do it! What about the people like me? I know I can&rsquo;t do it, and every time they make it seem so easy &ndash; it&rsquo;s all a damn lie. There are five things I can do well: 1. Brush crumbs onto the floor, 2. Breathe, 3. Sit, 4. Eat potato chips and 5. Watch the T.V. An exciting life I do lead! Not as exciting as theirs I&rsquo;m sure. Is it jealousy that ravages over me? I suppose I could help them make a buck by spending one of mine. But why?! Why should I?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fabulous, now my stomach is upset. My potato chips foil me yet again! Make that four things I can do well. Where&rsquo;s my Pepto? Sweet, sweet delicious liquid that soothes &ndash; come to me my lovely! There it is. Take a swig and feel better. All well again. I think that I love these people because they entertain &ndash; the enthusiasm, the fact that they lead a better life than I do &ndash; it makes me feel that there&rsquo;s hope for me too. But I loathe them as well &ndash; because they made something of their life and I did not! I&rsquo;m wrecked with grief. Torn between two feelings like a star-crossed lover&hellip;our relationship being this box comprised of liquid crystals and plastic and&hellip;not like lovers at all. Friends I suppose is what we really are. We&rsquo;re not friends&hellip;we&rsquo;re enemies! No&hellip;frenemies. That&rsquo;s the word! Where&rsquo;s my dictionary? Right, I don&rsquo;t own one. Oh well. Look at her eyes&hellip;they&rsquo;re as vacant as mine are. No they&rsquo;re not &ndash; quit lying to yourself. I really should get some sleep &ndash; but wait! It&rsquo;s only three payments of $39.95? How can I lose?! I mean, even someone like me can use it &ndash; after all, they did say it was as easy as 1&hellip;2&hellip;3.</p>
