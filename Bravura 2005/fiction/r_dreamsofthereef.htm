      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Gold-striped Maroon Clown nestles down into the long tentacles of the Bubble-Tipped Rose. Playful symbiosis between the two until he eagerly buries himself inside her as I watch. And she responds with arms that flow around him, through gentle tidal currents that smother him with lubricious poison. His immunity clouds his consciousness like slow, encrusting, coralline algae. Their colors drip together before resting. And they ignore me. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I inhale. What brings them together? I wonder as I silently watch and feel a million years of rain press against my body. And then I exhale. Unnatural, but too perfect; like we were before you left. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once rising vapors, we danced along the edge of the ocean, tickling sunsets, until Neptune lured you away. You left me drifting in this sea of unfrozen ice. Our laughs, dreams, and passion; drowned and then washed ashore. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, her fluorescent zooxanthella crawls and flickers along his skin, into his gaping mouth as he sleeps, and passes through his eyes and enters into his fluid-filled dreams of vast blue Acropora and dissolving Xenia. He rests peacefully with her. Below, hoards of Lysmata scavenge and pick at decaying corpses (I hope they find you). Anglers wait silently on rocks; patiently casting their lures (I hope they catch you). Stars sift through the night until dawn. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reaches skyward at sunrise and gathers her floating thoughts, searching for him. He returns to her with food they both devour. She embraces him once more and tastes his skin and he responds by gently nestling against her. Waves crash above them as they court above the sea floor. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I inhale. I reach inside the net I carry and my fingers tangle, like once my feelings in your heart. I reach farther and find a bottle of cyanide. I gaze at them together and then stare at her as I slowly raise the bottle over them, and search for you once more (it would make it easier). But you're not inside her (I don&rsquo;t see you). I exhale. She's too beautiful. They're too perfect. I lower the bottle and watch us more as we were, staring up at the flickering ripples of the sea above and then down inside into the cavernous rocks below. Gliding along each other, they never notice me. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I slip away. </p>
