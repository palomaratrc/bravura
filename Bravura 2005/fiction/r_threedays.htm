      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days. That's how long I've been tied to this chair. Three fucking days. There are no clocks up here, the only indication of time I have are thin strands of sunlight peeking through cracks in the roof, before eventually disappearing into the dead silence of night. Occasional drops of blood spill from the pipe sized open chasm in the back of my head. A painful reminder of how I ended up in this attic. I don't know why I keep straining my eyes to see; I know every inch of this hellhole by heart. Sitting in the rocking chair across from me staring blankly is a Raggedy Andy doll with a switchblade through his throat. He sits there unrestrained, mocking me with a sewn on smile that makes my blood run cold. Annie is suspended from a beam above him in a crudely tied noose, shorn of her precious red locks. Newspaper clippings of all the local missing person cases litter the walls in some sort of morbid wallpaper homage to kidnapping and murder. Males and females around my age are all missing or presumed dead. Corpses of rats lie in the adjacent corner next to chunks of rotting cheese. The most recent victim still twitching from nerve synapses firing post mortem. I couldn't help but feel like I had lost a pet. Normally I hate rats, but I'd developed a strange attachment to them. They were the only other living thing in this attic besides me. Their presence slightly eased the overwhelming sense of loneliness. I remember watching each one of them thrash violently while gasping for their last breath as the pellets in the cheese took hold. I couldn't help but feel utterly deserted as the last of my little companions finally expired before my eyes. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn't long before the room's sweltering heat made the presence of death all the more obvious to my senses. I've lost count of how many times I've dry heaved from the smell of rotting animal flesh. It takes every ounce of my willpower not to succumb to my gag reflex. The duct tape stretching over my mouth would ensure that if I did throw up, I would choke to death in the most humiliating way possible. I feel light headed. The taut ropes digging into my wrists and ankles drench themselves with a fresh coat of grisly red every time I find the strength to struggle. The blood oozing from my untreated wounds stains the brittle floorboards beneath my bare feet. My throat feels numb from all the muffled attempts at screaming for help.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streaks of sunlight filtering down into the room begin to turn bright amber- orange. The sun will be setting soon, bringing my third day in the chair of torture to a close. I'm so hungry and my tongue feels like tough shoe leather. Even the remains of my furry friends start to look appetizing. The dizziness in my head begins to take hold and I feel the overwhelming urge to sleep. It doesn't worry me that my attacker may burst through the door and finish me off while I'm sleeping; I don't care. Death would be a welcome release from the painful purgatory of this chair. The strands of sunlight fade and the bitter cold of night sets in. Despite the fact that it's freezing in this god-forsaken attic, I'm too tired to even shiver. My eyelids begin to weigh me down as I muster the last bit of strength I have into a half muted cry of anguish and desperation. The painful straining of my muscles causes the gash in my head to bleed anew. I have a sinking feeling that no one will ever hear me or that my cries will be mistaken for a wounded animal. I AM a wounded animal. As the last note of my shrill symphony echoes off the decaying walls and gradually fades into the darkness, I finally give in to the will of my body. My ten ton eyelids fall over my eyes and there is nothing but black.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am awakened by the bitter taste of vomit. I snap awake and thrash in a fit of temporary panic, causing the ropes that bind me to dig in a little deeper. After regaining what is left of my composure, I tilt my scathed head backward as far as the chair will permit to help choke down the burning stomach acid that found its way into my esophagus. Fortunately, the hot liquid coated my tongue and the back of my throat, temporarily relieving my terminal thirst. With traces of adrenaline still dancing around in my bloodstream, I begin to flail my arms and legs as fast as I can. The ropes sink their fiber talons into my wounds deeper than ever. Blood seethes from my wrists in small amounts at first, then the flow increases enough to spill some on the antiquated arms of the chair. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of all my thrashing and seizure like movements, I do not make a sound. I know that I have blood to spare, but in this situation my voice is a precious commodity that cannot go to waste. The wound in the back of my head pulsates in perfect harmony with my racing heart. In some sort of miraculous occurrence, or some sort of fluke, I can feel the rope around my left ankle loosening. I cease all other movement save for my left leg. Sweat beads on my forehead and runs down my face, a drop coming off the tip of my nose while the others invade and sting my eyes. A small pool of blood forms under my left foot. The pain seething around my ankle is meaningless to me. I move and jerk my left leg until I thought the rope would saw right through to the bone. The pain is absolutely maddening. My body is screaming for me to give in, but I refuse. I change tactics and begin to kick forward slow and hard with my left leg. I look for anything as a source of help. I stare at mocking Raggedy Andy; pan down to the corpses of my furry companions, anything to get me enraged enough to dig down for that extra bit of strength that all creatures have in dire straits. A wave of heat rushes over my body and I feel the binding around my left ankle break. I look down at it in triumph and surprise. The rope has wedged itself into the wound in my ankle. I don't have the energy to power out of any other bindings. I bask in this temporary victory however short lived it may be. If my end is to be here, at least I went down with a fight. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatigue washes over me in large doses. I know I will not have another burst of energy like that in my present condition. I have not eaten nor have I had anything to drink, save my own bile, for over three days. My only option now is to rest. To pass the time, I begin reading some of the newspaper clippings pasted on the walls. I wondered if they would have anything on the killer/kidnapper that I obviously was in the clutches of. After straining to read the small print for an hour or so, I managed to piece together police speculations and conceptual profiles of this butcher: &quot;Based on the choice of victims, and the nature and circumstances of the kidnappings, it is assumed that the attacker is a white male in his mid to late thirties. His motives are unclear, but it may be true that he keeps mementos of each victim. This man is obviously highly intelligent, due to the fact that he has successfully eluded police for several months. There seems to be no apparent pattern as to the choosing of his victims with the exception of them all being Caucasian...&quot; I couldn't read any more, my eyesight was getting blurry, no doubt due to the amount of blood I have lost. I don't know about all their speculations, but as far as keeping mementos go.... isn't that the truth. I can feel a heat source radiating directly above me. It must be noon or close to it. It feels hot as an oven in this attic, the unmistakable odor of death snakes around the room polluting the air with its vile perfume.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't take it anymore. I HAVE to get out of here. I don't know if my little rest was enough to give me the strength I needed, but I need to find out. Ignoring the pain and the rope cinched between the wilting skin flaps of my left ankle, I start stomping on the brittle floorboards and crying out with what voice I have left. The pain surges through my left leg all the way to the gash in my head. I don't care. My throat feels like it's on fire, yet I continue to scream as best I can with this tape over my mouth. I can feel the board underneath my foot starting to give out. STOMP...STOMP...STOMP...blood starts to siphon from my wounds onto the floor once again; the flow is strong and nearly constant. I can feel the familiar dizziness about to overtake me. I can't stop now. STOMP...STOMP...STOMP...I can't stop now.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My voice fails me; my throat has become too dry to allow me to cry out. I know that soon my body will give out and I will either pass out from exhaustion or crossing my threshold of pain. My head is swimming and I can feel the urge to gag once again. STOMP...STOMP...STO.... I stop. I swear I heard something. I hear the distant squeaking of what must be an old screen door miles away, or so it seems. THUMP.... THUMP...THUMP...someone else is in the house. My heart skyrockets into my throat and a fresh rush of anxiety hits my veins. I can't scream, and I'm not sure how many stomps I have left in me. I don't care who it is. I just want to get out of this chair, out of this attic, by rescue or otherwise. STOMP.... STOMP...STOMP...that's it. I have no more left in me. Tired. Hungry. Thirsty. THUMP.... THUMP...THUMP...it was getting louder.... closer.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THUMP.... THUMP...THUMP...I could hear it coming up the stairs, the noises getting faster, closer together. THUMPTHUMPTHUMPTHUMPTHUMP...I held my breath as I felt my wounds pulsate and my heart race. Slowly the doorknob began to turn back and forth, back and forth. Locked. On the other side of the door I could make out a man's voice.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hello? Is anyone in there? I heard some racket up here. I'm awfully sorry if I'm intruding.&quot; Music to my ears.... I have to let him know that I'm in here.... but I'm so tired.... NO. I have to let him KNOW! <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hello?&quot; He repeated in a louder tone. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ST...O...M...P! <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;OK I hear you! I'm going to go find something to break the door down!&quot; The man screamed, a tinge of excitement in his voice. THUMPTHUMPTHUMPTHUMPTHUMPTHUMP...He bolts down the stairs. Minutes pass. It feels like an eternity.... what could be taking him so long? Did he have second thoughts and decide to abandon me in a fit of cowardice? My heart sank and I began to feel sick. I started to think that if the urge to throw up came, why fight it. I want to get out of this chair. THUMP.... THUMP...THUMP...THUMP...the noise grew louder. I can hear little grunts and panting. He must have found something appropriate to break down the door. I made out his familiar voice on the other side of the door: &quot;Hey in there! I'm coming in!&quot; Instantly I heard the loud cracking of old wood. The door was giving way quickly and I could see the object that was causing the racket: a log. Maybe he found it in the fireplace or outside. CRACK...CRACK.... CRAAAAACK!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door bursts open and a tall man rushes in, log in hand ready to crack any skull that gets in his way. He reflexively cups his hand over his nose and mouth. &quot;Oh my God!&quot; He says in a sick tone. I had nearly forgotten about the overwhelming stench of death and decay in here. I guess in a sad way I had gotten used to it. Dropping his newfound weapon, he rushes over to me. He cuts my bindings loose with a buck knife he has in his pocket. Very carefully, he slides the rope out from between the two bloody skin flaps of my left ankle. He slowly removes the duct tape from the mouth I forgot I had. I took a deep breath through my mouth and relished it as though it were the first. Before making eye contact with my rescuer, I quickly turned my head and threw up next to the chair that had served as my own personal hell for almost four days. Embarrassed, I finally managed to look at my rescuer. He was tall, taller than me by a little bit, maybe in his forties at best. I open my mouth and manage to eek out one word.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wa....ter.&quot; I screech. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You must be parched, boy.&quot; he responded, promptly rushing down the stairs. It feels so good to stand up, although my legs are a bit shaky and a little numb. I finally get the chance to stretch my muscles and walk around after three days in that god-awful chair. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THUMPTHUMPTHUMPTHUMPTHUMPTHUMP.... In rushes my knight in shining armor with a tall glass of water. I snatch it from him with such speed that it causes him to jump. I gulp the contents of the glass down greedily. Water.... I can't believe I'm actually drinking water. Instantly my senses feel reinvigorated, my tongue reverts to the soft moist mass in my mouth. My dry, cracked lips soak up the liquid like a sponge. &quot;What in the hell happened to you, son?&quot; he said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I've been stuck up here for three days. I'm so hungry...so hungry....&quot; I respond. He looks at me and smiles one of those smiles that go from ear to ear, like the Cheshire cat. He puts one hand on my shoulder and belts out in a proud voice:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, don't you worry none, son. I got plenty of things you can eat...ole Jim here'll stuff you to the gills.&quot; I look straight into his eyes and return that Cheshire cat smile.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes.... I know you will, Jim.&quot; I beam. The next look on Jim's face wasn't so comical, it was one of pure horror. They always get the same look when sharp metal pierces soft flesh and punctures the internal organs. It's not a look of pain, it's a look of.... disbelief. Their eyes widen to a point where it looks like they're going to explode out of the skull, their mouths always drop open, and they always struggle to say something but they never can. While good ole Jim was downstairs so kindly getting me my refreshing glass of water, I managed to pocket the switchblade I stuffed into Raggedy Andy's throat. This is what happens when you don't pay attention to your environment. Me, on the other hand, I know every inch of this hellhole by heart. This is MY attic. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don't know what a thrill it is to play the wounded animal. Because in playing the wounded animal, you play on the weaknesses of other people. They always want to be good Samaritans. Though I must say I had never been stuck in that chair for this long. Even I was starting to have my doubts. My wounds? Self inflicted. A bit extreme? Well, the extreme always seems to make an impression. Besides, if a member of our illustrious law enforcement were to find his (or her, I'm not prejudiced) way up here, I would look like the unfortunate victim of a madman. That's what they all think. That's how I've gotten to them all. No one expects someone to hit themselves over the head with a pipe, and then half consciously tie themselves to a chair and then yell for help to draw his victims in. This routine has been going on for several months. Though usually I'm not tied up for three days, more like one at the most. Someone always comes to rescue me. The walls in this house are purposely thin, especially in the attic. Sound travels very well here. Eventually, people like good ole Jim wander in here, and see me in a very pitiful state. But as soon as I get enough strength back, the tide turns and I go from wounded animal to predator. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't fear dying. I fear being forgotten. If I were to die during one of my routines, at least I have all the newspaper clippings and mementos of the good Samaritans that find their way up here. The papers were right on that account at least. I always keep something. As long as people keep talking about me, I'll never die. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every good predator is swift and precise when pitted against his prey. I am not wholly without heart; I always aim for the same spot right under the lungs. That way my prey goes into shock and feels no pain at all. After all, they were kind enough to set me free. Also, every good predator knows to never let a kill go to waste. I have never let anything go to waste. Speaking of which, I'm famished. I'm looking forward to having ole Jim over for dinner. I hope he keeps his word and stuffs me to the gills.</td>
