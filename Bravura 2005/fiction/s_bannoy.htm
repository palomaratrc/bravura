      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadie always hated feeding Bannoy. Out of all her chores it was definitely her least favorite. She&rsquo;d rather clean the outhouse than feed him, and that was one of the most disgusting jobs she could think of. She hated everything about him&mdash;his appearance&mdash;his behavior&mdash;his mere existence was an insult to her intelligence. Knowing he lived made her ashamed of being alive herself; just the thought of him was nauseating.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a lump of nerves caught in her throat she walked to the thick oak door that lead to the cellar. In her left hand Sadie held a platter of rancid meat and moldy vegetables; in her right she gripped the key to the door. Her hand trembled with anticipation as she inserted the key. She twitched at the sound of the lock disengaging. Nerves squirmed in her belly like slugs, as she turned the knob and entered.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness was intimidating at first, because she could only hear him grunting and struggling with his restraints at the foot of the stairs. She set down the food and lit a match. After retrieving the platter she descended the stairs, lighting the wall lamps as she went down. Like always, her nerves eased up as the basement began to slowly illuminate. At least he couldn&rsquo;t lurk in the shadows any longer. The thought of being down in the dark with him was unbearable. As much as it pained her to set eyes on him, she felt safer once the room was brightened. At least then she could see the terror face to face, and shield herself from it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bannoy began to howl like a coyote as she turned the corner at the bottom of the stairs. He always got excited when he saw her. He jumped up and down, sniffing at the air as Sadie made her entrance. He choked as he struggled to exceed the boundaries of his collar. The chain holding him to the wall had run its length, yet he still pressed forward. He reached out to Sadie clawing and snarling like a mad dog.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She kept her distance and tried not to look at him, but looking away was impossible. How could you not stare at such a monstrosity? After sixteen years of dealing with him it never got any easier. Bannoy watched her intently, squatting close to the ground as if ready to pounce. Bearing his teeth he began to growl. He was a most hideous creature&mdash;a thing torn from the pages of a horror tale. It was hard to believe he was real, and harder still for Sadie to except him as her reality.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bannoy&rsquo;s head was large and disproportionate to his skeletal frame. His skull was an enormous misshapen sphere of peaks and valleys. His head&mdash; like a beached fish&mdash; constantly flopped back and forth from his neck&rsquo;s lack of support. His body was twisted and mangled in heinous deformity as well. His right arm was short and stumpy with only three claw-like fingers sprouting out from the palm. His right arm was much longer&mdash; too long in fact&mdash;but at least it resembled that of human being. His face was the worst. The left eye was too low, and it always swam around lazily in its socket. His nose was pushed back in a grotesque snout, and his mouth and cheeks drooped over his jawbone. Bannoy&rsquo;s features always reminded Sadie of an ugly St. Bernard, so she dubbed him, <em>&ldquo;St. Bannoy&mdash;the Dog-Faced Boy.&rdquo;</em> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bannoy stood filthy and naked taking in Sadie with his good eye. He barked in excitement, and Sadie was repulsed to find him fully aroused. She set his food on the floor, and gave the tray a swift kick, sliding the platter across the room. He hunched down quickly, grabbing at a piece of meat. He tore into it with his crooked pointy teeth, like a savage beast ripping into prey. Sadie watched him eat for a moment longer, and then turned abruptly, making her way back up the stairs. She blew out the wall lamps as she went, once again leaving the room in a blanket of shadows. She quietly locked the door behind her, leaving her brother to enjoy his meal<em>.<br>
