      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was 18 I discovered Ayn Rand. Atlas Shrugged came to me as a gift, an unexpected surprise, from a friend of mine. I happily accepted the book, but then put it off to the side for many weeks, as teenagers so often do. When I finally did get around to reading it, it was like a religious experience as William James likes to call them. It was like seeing the face of God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I finished the 1168 page book two weeks later. The first few pages were like an addicts first exposure to crack or heroin; I read voraciously, as though &ldquo;the future&rdquo; was a concept I had never heard of. After Atlas, I read The Fountainhead, then Atlas again, then The Fountainhead again and then all of her non-fiction.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Rand says that the act of writing is a &ldquo;re-creation of reality according to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments.&rdquo; In other words, by writing this down and showing it to you, I'm inviting you to step into my brain and see the world, if only for a moment, through my eyes. For egotists like myself, it is difficult to think of a more solemn offering of tribute. So, gentle reader, here's to you.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two types of mornings for me: good mornings and bad mornings.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On good mornings I wake up and can hardly contain my exuberance for life. I hastily get out of bed and go about my morning routine with a sense of purpose and joy: flossing isn't just dragging a piece of string between my teeth, it's an act of cleansing my temple; taking a shower isn't just getting the dirt and groggy morning feelings out of me, it's an act of self reverence&mdash;I shower because I am beautiful and I deserve it; and when I dress, it's not just covering my naked body for the sake of modesty, it's like preparing myself for war. The world is mine to conquer.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then there are the bad mornings. I wake up, open my eyes just a crack as I roll over to look at the rising sun shining its golden rays through the blinds of my bedroom window. And despite its beauty, I can feel nothing but contempt for this wonderful ball of fire, without which life on earth would not be possible. Precisely for that reason too&mdash;I am alive, and you, Mr. Sunshine, you made it all possible. Then, being to much of a coward to end my own life, I roll over and go back to sleep for another hour, which is the next best thing to death.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I finally do wake up, I don't head straight for the bathroom; I head for the computer, and piddle around on it for an hour. I get lost in the headlines: &ldquo;The President is at Camp David...&rdquo;, &ldquo;10 Killed in Iraqi Suicide Attack...,&rdquo; &ldquo;Michael Jackson Wears Stunning Outfit to Child Molestation Case.&rdquo; Reading the headlines is not so much about finding out the latest Michael Jackson pedophilia updates as it is about gaining a sense of control. Because that's what makes depression so utterly terrifying: it's like seeing the world through the darkest and most pessimistic set of eyes, and knowing that there is nothing you can do about it. Well, now that's not entirely true. Exercise, diet, friends, loved ones, and pills can all help to even out the dips and peaks of depression, but it's very difficult to get into the habit of such things if you can find no motivation to do anything.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet despite it all, we go on and that's what makes us so heroic. The strength of mind it takes to see past the fog of depression, to see that wonderful light at the end of the tunnel; it is an act of sheer individualistic defiance. I think the fact that I manage to get up every morning would make Ayn Rand proud.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're still confused and have no idea what the heck I am talking about, I have one last offering. Go to your local music store and pick up a copy of Rachmaninoff's 2 nd Concerto and skip to the second movement. I have never heard a more eloquent statement of what it feels like to have depression.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It starts with violins, soft at first, then gaining momentum, as the challenge of getting up in the morning does when the eyes begin to take focus. Then a single flute takes over, complemented by the emotional undertones of a piano, and espouses it's loneliness, a loneliness that all people with depression know too well. The flute has a poetic quality to its sound; it is the poetry of melancholy.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the piano takes over; this is the mind struggling to make sense of the situation. I am depressed&mdash;but why? How? What should I do? The music begins to get more and more intense, steadily climaxing as one does when finally asking the question: to live or die? Again, the music becomes contemplative; it's rhythms flowing up and down spastically, unsure of the answer which is to come.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the answer comes. The music explodes into celebration. Now, quite sure of itself, the music dances and frolics about, seemingly ignorant of it's own innocent glee. But things then come back into context; the knowledge that depression is here to stay sinks in. The music returns to self doubt and contemplation: can I make it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, at the very end, the music creates its final answer with piano, violin, and flute all melding into a single instrument that soars into the air like a butterfly flapping its wings about on a summer day in the park, finally forgiving itself for existing and just enjoying the quality of aliveness.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shivers go down my spine every time I hear those final seconds. It's like meeting an old friend for the first time all over again.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you still have no idea what I'm talking about then it means one of two things; either I am a terrible writer and have failed miserably at completing this assignment, or you are one of the blessed many that does not have depression. I am envious. But I would never trade places. Because if I can conquer depression, maybe I can conquer life too.
