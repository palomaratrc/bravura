      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is nothing but a series of actions you take for granted each moment after the next. You do these commands given from your brain; you have no idea why, but that's life; you're a rerun, 35mm film. You look, you smell, you hear, you taste, you think, you feel. The same thing repeated over and over again. <br>
        Five. Repeat steps two through six.
          <p>You check your watch:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You walk in the building and you already feel it. You feel the painstakingly cheerful attitude you have to put on for each customer you're required to greet.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hi, Welcome to Galaxy 6; How are you today?&quot; you say to a pleasant looking man with his children. They all have blond hair and blue eyes, Nazis. Then again, to an elderly lady, who smells the way a week old road-kill skunk, intestines pan caked to the road, would. She's going to see The Passion. You tear their tickets, slipping one after another into the pedestal, as if you have the power to let anyone in at your pleasing. But, you greet them. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's what you do when you're the door man; greet, tear tickets, and slip into the pedestal. Greet, tear tickets, and slip into the pedestal. You greet, &quot;Hi, welcome to Galaxy 6, your state of the art hometown theater,&quot; those words haunt you when you rarely do sleep. You tear their tickets, and shove them into the pedestal. </p>
          <p><em>Charlie tells you, &quot;A conscience is a terrible curse. I think, I feel, I suffer.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You stare at your wall above your computer because nothing else seems constructive, and see all your idols, hero's, role models, and life goals, over lapping each other in a magnificent collage of accomplishment, staring right back at you. There's Chuck Palahniuk who asks you, &quot;If you were to die right now, how would you feel about your life?&quot; Charlie Kaufman gets it through you're head, &quot;Today is the first day of the rest of my life&quot;. Will Christopher Baer tell you, &quot;Every time I close my eyes I'm dreaming.&quot; These are your friends. They're the only ones who understand you, accomplished writers. They're reminding you that you're a failure by quoting their own works. Envy&hellip; one of the seven deadly sins.</em><br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You check your watch:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You make your ways through the back, and start to climb the stairs stained with piss colored &quot;Do the Dew&quot;; step by step by step. You're bothered with the same old clich&eacute; dialogue from a horribly written screenplay by fellow slave, not working. The one reason they even want to talk is so you feel obligated to respond, so they can talk about themselves. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How was your weekend?&quot; You didn't even know it was the weekend. What day is it anyhow? You fall into the typical dialogue that plagues mankind. You always think to reply with &quot;I hate you&quot;, but don't. </p>
          <p><em>Chuck tells you, &quot;Everything is so far away, a copy of a copy of a copy.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You sit up at night worrying, not sleeping, not eating, and you have no idea why. Well, you do know why, but you refuse to allow yourself to believe it's the reason. The reason being you realize you can't write, you don't know how to write, and you have absolutely no inspiration because life is boring and meaningless, going nowhere. Nothing ever happens to you.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You stay up total nights, for days at a time just sitting there, staring at your blank computer screen. You wouldn't think It's so bad; time passing by, nothing else to do. So why is it so bad? Because! You sit in your grey monotone room every goddamned night staring at the computer screen waiting for a breakthrough you've been told would come. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons you can't sleep can't be so easily categorized into being called insomnia. You know this because you do sleep, but just enough to barely get by; a couple hours a week. You choose not to sleep because you desperately want to write &quot;the great American novel&quot; and your life does get shorter each day.</em><br>
  <br>
You check your watch:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where you work is this old run-down six-plex movie theater in which the outcome of the day's total is always four digits with a negative leading the party,because nobody comes to see a movie just so the projector can either:<br>
  A. Lose power, causing complete blackness surrounding the tightly congested seating?<br>
  B. Have the film knot itself up, stopping the film in exactly one place, while the lighthouse melts the film, completely ruining the climax of the moment?<br>
  C. Project a shitty remake of a blockbuster clone. Done over and over and over and over and over and over again. The same old shit. Your life.</p>
          <p>You check your watch:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're up in this booth, the entire perimeter of the building, alone. There's projector one, two, three, four, five, and six, your only friends for the next nine hours. You hate the people you work with and you hate being alone, a deadly combination. You make your way to the desk in the corner, positioned just right so you can hear all the inner workings, like six machine guns from every which angle, firing down on you.</p>
          <p><em>Baer tells you, &quot;...I am fast coming to the conclusion that, like cab drivers who secretly want to be writers, lawyers who want to be filmmakers are often dangerous assholes.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You look down. You see the gun next to your keyboard with the spacebar that fails every so often. You grip it and slowly pull it up towards your chin just letting it skim the nerve wrenching skin along the neck. So, what now? Do you pull the trigger? Sure, why not&hellip;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click! The sound of a ruse, like smashing action figures together in a cunning fight.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Damn, its plastic&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where it gets really sad; You do this every night. You pretend to kill yourself with a fake gun because you're too timid to go out and get a real gun and paint the walls from midnight mist to crimson. You're home alone; it's okay to be out of mind, still in body.</em></p>
          <p>You check your watch:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only people that come to your theater are pedophiles and the elderly. The only reason the Theater, which you're a slave for, is still open is because it's a tax write off. So, in the long run, you do make the corporation some money, while still remaining penniless yourself. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a little extra income, you steal old movie trailers and sell them for ten bucks a pop to their fanatics online. If it's a popular movie, like Lord of the Rings, the fanatics go crazy and pay up to fifty for one. One mans trash is another's shelf space; another reason why you despise the world. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of cut-backs, you're not only the projectionist, but you're also doorman, the usher, and sometimes even the concessions, all while having to put of with the manager's bullshit. You could run the building by yourself, but still make minimum wage.</p>
          <p><em>Chuck asks you, &quot;What would you have wished you done before you die?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More time passes, it's almost dawn, and still your screen is nothing but hopelessly empty. Most like to call it love. You decide to just look around your desk because it seemed like a good idea at the time. All you see is rubble of papers full of notes, false starts, shitty characters, bullshit story lines that go nowhere, your pitiful excuse of an attempt to draw a story board without a beginning or an end to your stories.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you nail your own casket closed forever, never to see the eternal sunshine again, your going to write a great story. A story that will someday be analyzed in college literature classes. A story that would make the reader feel what the writer felt. Then, you can end it all. For some reason you feel uplifted, a sense of completeness when you think this. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, you look back at your computer and you're pulled down again. Time passes&hellip;</em></p>
          <p>You check your watch:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine you're that elderly woman, and you come to see The Passion of &hellip;whoever. The kind of catholic you want to slap some sense into. And right when the matchstick man is getting impaled to the cross, all the intermittents start ripping through the holes in the film so the projector is only running sixteen frames a second instead of twenty-four normal. Imagine you see this and your heart fails because you're seeing your lord and savior go up in smoke of light and chemicals as the poisonous xenon bulb burns a hole through the film. You're the projectionist; it's your wrong doing, the villain. You're the projectionist. You're both the hero and the villain when a machine breaks down. You purposely destroy the moment, you're the villain. You fix it, you're the hero. </p>
          <p><em>Baer tells you, &quot;I wanted to tell him how fucking pitiful it was, how tiresome, this irrational urge to confirm my existence in one mirror after another.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You've been staring at your computer screen, entitled Document 1 - Microsoft Word, with the dazed look of a catatonic, for what seems to be millennia more and you suddenly notice the lower right side of your screen, its 9:00AM. You have been staring for past the ten hours. You have to be at work in thirty.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While getting dressed you look at yourself in a mirror; another dimension, another disappointment. You don't know why you look into the mirror because it just depresses you more. You live in a world where appearance is everything. </em></p>
          <p>You check your watch:<br>
            Being a projectionist is like reading an instruction booklet: <br>
            1. Arrive to work on time; you don't want to miss a start, or make the other projectionist late. 2. Sit down at desk, check/sign/update logbook<br>
            3. Wait patiently smiling, because you never know when corporate is going to come and visit, for your next thread and/or start <br>
            4. Thread and/or start a movie<br>
            5. Don't forget to check your watch every five minutes, and walk your booth every ten minutes. <br>
            6. Repeat steps two through five, until shift is done. See you at the movies&hellip;</p>
          <p><em>Baer says, &quot;Sometimes there is nothing so horrible as a familiar face.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see yourself staring back, and you're morbidly disgusted. You're six feet and you weigh 135 because people are stupid and believe you when you tell them that; you only weigh 115 pounds. You must be dying of cancer, think of those postcards featuring fragile children dieing of AIDS you always get in the mail; saying, &quot;We know you meant to donate to save this poverty stricken infant&quot;. You look like they look, feel like they feel, have the same saddest eyes of the world as they do, but when it comes down to it all, you could beat the crap out of them. You're going to go find what you can out of that empty refrigerator.</em></p>
          <p>You check your watch:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's thirty minutes before your next thread, so what do you do? You sit there, lean back to the point at which it feels your going to fall backwards off balance, and stare at your watch every five or so minutes, because even though its only been a couple seconds, it feels like eternity, like you could count each flap of a hummingbirds wing.</p>
          <p>You check your watch:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I an NPC, a non-playing-character, in a role playing game? A game of life? Someone who just walks around, does what they are programmed to do? Say what they are programmed to say? You're certainly not the hero, the free action player, going where ever he feels he must to save the day.&quot; You say this to yourself in the private bathroom, the one upside to this job.</p>
          <p><em>Chuck tells you, &quot;Shot-gunning anybody in this room would be the moral equivalent of killing a car, a vacuum cleaner, a Barbie doll.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're back in the bathroom getting ready for work. You do societies expectations for presentability. Remember, it's all about projecting an image. You comb; you brush; you spray; you clean; you hurl; you brush again, and you're off.</em></p>
          <p>You check your watch:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's time to thread [step four]. You walk to number one. You take the brain out of the middle platter, and the ring out of the top platter, and you switch them. Put the top platter on payout. You guide the leader through the brain. Next comes the triangle. You guide the film above, below, above, across, below, above, below, above, below, above, below, through the all the rollers on the exterior of the platters and projector, and back onto the ring. Sounds easy right?<br>
  <br>
  You check your watch:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You pull the leader into a large pile on the ground, until you get to near the end of it, and the beginning of the feature presentation. </p>
          <p>You check your watch:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you have to do the managers expectancy of cleaning the machine. You open the projector door. You unlock all four of the intermittents. Turn on the projector motor, and clean the teeth on the intermittents with a tooth brush. You unscrew, and remove the film gate trap, and comb the surfaces that the film touches with alcohol. You take the projector completely apart, and put it back together again.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are the soldier who digs the hole, and refills it.</p>
          <p>You check you watch:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You pull the top film in front and behind the two rollers on the top of the projector. You fit the film on the sprockets around the top intermittent. You lock it. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This job is self mutilating. You should just quit. You go downstairs, movie half threaded, and knock as hard as possible on the managers door, gun ready and pointed. Make them piss themselves. The door swings open and suddenly you're back inthe booth. Did you just imagine that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You open the film gate trap. Holding the film between the middle finger and index finger of your left hand, and the pinky and ring finger on your right hand, you position the film just right so it starts on frame. One sprocket hole, a fourth of an inch in either direction or you ruin the pedophiles movie. Holding the film perfectly in place you have to reach your thumb around, not moving your hand, and release the film gate trap, snapping the film in place. You unlock the top intermittent and pull it tight, then count three sprockets back. Unlock the shoe intermittent and count four sprockets up, and then relock it. Slide the film, in front of one roller, around the sound drum, and around another roller. You unlock the bottom intermittent and pull the film right stretching the distance between the sound drum and its rollers, as tight as it can go. You count three fourths of an inch back and lock the intermittent. You place the film under the safety release and around and between two rollers. You flip the platter with the ring on it to rewind, and it pulls the film tight. Viola, it's back to where it was an hour and a half ago.</p>
          <p>You check your watch:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody downstairs, being the mindless drones, actually knows how the projectors work, but that's life, right? You're downstairs cleaning the theater to Saint Gibson's so called masterpiece, and the same old woman approaches you. &quot;Can you rewind the movie so I can see the couple minutes I missed when it went black?&quot; You smile at her and drop your butler, grip the broom with both fists and you swing into the side of her head as hard as you can imagine. &quot;Excuse me, can you rewind the movie?&quot; &quot;No. You can't rewind a projector.&quot; As soon as they step foot out of the car, people just turn their brains off. It's what you would call a &quot;Blockbuster Movie&quot;. A movie that gets the top grossing numbers, horribly written, full of plot holes, and is the most intellectually devoid movie known to man, Pirates of the Caribbean. </p>
          <p>You check your watch:<br>
            Someone once said, &quot;History has a way of repeating itself.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You take one last look over your art. &quot;Shit!&quot; You forgot to check the direction the sound bar was facing, it's backwards. The guest's movies will be the muted deaf life of a communist.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only actually good movies out there are movies about life, and how miserable and how much suffering one goes through. That's why you like Charlie. He portrays your suffering perfectly.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After you're done completely redoing your art [end of step 4], you wonder if the people waiting for their movie heard you through the &quot;sound proof&quot; glass. You look down through the porthole of the theater like a god, it's empty. Your vote does matter.</p>
          <p>You check your watch:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step six. Repeat steps two through five.</p>
          <p>You check your watch:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step six. Repeat steps two through five.</p>
          <p>You check your watch:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step six, an endless storyline in which every time you go through it, you dig yourself deeper and deeper into it, only being redeemed by the ticking of a watch. You make $6.75 and hour. This goes on for another seven hours.</p>
          <p>You check your watch:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's almost time for the other projectionist to come and relieve you of your duties, for another couple of hours at least. You wonder how many problems will be caused, on his account, for you to fix tomorrow morning, furthermore feeding your isolation and sanity.</p>
          <p><em>Baer tells you, &quot;She said her name was Jude.&quot;</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're off work, what are you going to do?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You decide it would be best to drive home and stare blankly at your computer screen, waiting for tomorrow to come. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a woman in the parking lot around the corner. She's stealing your stereo from the truck. She looks like she would be into strange sexual fetishes, wearing a weather tight biker jacket, ripped jeans, and spiked heels. Not caring, you approach her. She looks like the kind that would cut your throat if provoked without second thought. Hands like knives. You pull out your plastic gun and hold it up to her, the way detectives do in the movies. She laughs and walks right up and kisses you. Poison Ivy comes to mind, a kiss of death. Next thing you know, you're on the ground, and all you can feel are your balls.<br>
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baer tells you, &quot;I think she fell for me.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie asks, &quot;Why is it that I fall in love with the first woman who pays the slightest attention to me?&quot; </em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With intense, pulsating pain attacking from the south, you gasp for air to come out with &quot;Thank you&quot;. Serenity achieved at last.</p>
          <p>You check your watch: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You decide it's best to drive home, dodging as many horrific drivers as possible, and stare at your blank computer screen waiting for tomorrow to come. [Step six. Repeat steps one through five.]</p>
          <p><em>Baer tells you, &quot;My name is Phineas Poe, and this is how it begins&quot;.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You look down from your wall and your computer is inadvertently telling you you're a failure. Not this time. You've been staring at your blank computer screen for the past six hours, afraid to start. You get up, anger flaring in your eyes, and you rip the collage from your wall. You look down at your watch, and it's stopped. You start to write.</em></p>
          <p>Chuck tells you,&quot; This is your life and it's passing you by one moment at a time&quot;.<br>
      six. Repeat steps beginning to end.</p></td>
