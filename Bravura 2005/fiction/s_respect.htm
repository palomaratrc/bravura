      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walks with steps less sure these days; and though he tries to keep his eyes up and aware of life around him as has been his habit of so many years, he finds he must take care to watch the ground beneath more often. He still finds it hard to see the years with his mind; time has not moved within the space of thought. His mind still sees itself as that twenty something and is almost surprised each morning with the image before him in the mirror. It seems the mirror has aged and no longer can give a true and clear image. Mirrors are like that, they seem to grow old; maybe it has something to do with the corrosive elements in the air.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He forgets things from time to time, or maybe it's just that he doesn't remember them. What with all the many things he has learned and stored away over the years, it's no wonder he sometimes can't find the word immediately. He relies more heavily on his old friend subconscious these days. He has developed a close relationship with him over the years; their practiced and knowing reliance and friendship has been finely tuned. Each has his own job, but they keep a close touch on one another, instinctively knowing the other's weaknesses and limits. Yet there is no condemnation in that knowledge - only a respected acknowledgment of their codependence. When he consciously cannot find the memory, he merely leaves the note on the desk and goes on with what he was doing, knowing that subconscious will pick up the note and go looking a little more deeply. After all, it is &quot;his&quot; filing system. Subconscious will eventually find it and remind him gently without accusation. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't see quite as well these days either. Some days the glasses weigh heavy on his nose. He notes with interest that he now recognizes people differently. Where once he would see their face far off; now he relies, more often than not, on their movement. It's interesting to realize that many people have very unique ways of walking or moving their body. He was once very good with faces; he could recognize someone quite easily from years before, but he was never that good with names. He has made an effort over the years to learn and remember more names, but that too comes with a cost&hellip; after all, there are an awful lot of names. People like it though, when someone remembers their name; there is a certain respect in that process, so he tries a little harder to learn and remember names.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is at war with his body from time to time; his body, like the mirror, seems to have handled the years less gracefully. It's very discouraging, and he feels greatly restricted by his body's complaints about the activities he continues to want to perform. It seems so unfair that the world has gone on aging so much faster than he. He just doesn't seem to be able to understand why there is such a disparaging difference in their years. It doesn't make sense.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He keeps himself active with new ideas, learning new things, taking classes&hellip; the thought in the back of his mind, like one of those inspirational picture posters you find everywhere, &quot;If you stop learning, you die.&quot; That seems to have been translated into his very being and modified to become his source of life and transforms into his daily goal, &quot;If you stop teaching&hellip;&quot; It is a bane and a benefactor; it is a desperation when he sees people who don't want to learn or don't care; or when the system that claims its purpose to be education, fails to really care and falls into the rhetoric of repetitious and meaningless criteria in lieu of understanding. It becomes a crusade-like charge at times, but it gives him a sense of purpose and satisfaction. He is inspired by those with so little who struggle to overcome their encumbrances to learning. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has never had many close friends, and over the years the few he had, have moved on. He brings them to mind from time to time, wondering what they are doing, if they ever think of him. He has never felt the need to be liked by everyone and is not hurt by the fact that someone does not like him for some reason. This may be why having a lot of friends was not all that important. He never understood how someone could have a lot of friends, but then maybe there is a definitional difference. To him a friend is someone he does not have to impress, someone with whom he can be himself, someone with whom he can have disagreements and yet not break the bond between them. Friends have always been hard to find, but once they are found, it is worth the effort. He doesn't make a big show of his friends; they are just people with whom he can find and give respect. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not so impressed by titles that people wear as much as his is the effort they put into their life. He feels that if someone is fortunate enough to gain a lot in life, that person should be willing to give far more to those less fortunate. He struggles to understand the need of some to amass great fortunes, to live so far beyond what is needed for comfort. His greatest life long concern is for the injustices of life; it is almost overwhelming at times and has the potential to spur him to great outrage if he is not cautious. Many people just do not understand the outrage and it is bewildering to him that they have somehow succumbed to the lack of sensitivity that is rampant in the world. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he were to have to pick a single philosophy to live by and pass on to the world, it would be to respect everyone's differences. Respect their uniqueness even though you cannot understand them, requiring of them only that they respect others in a like manner. We don't need a complex religion or legal system - just respect.</td>
