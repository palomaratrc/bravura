        Fall, 1987 </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;California &hellip; I hated the place the moment I arrived. I didn&rsquo;t hate the state so much, just the attitude that came along with it. I came to San Diego from a small mountain community in Colorado, and I couldn&rsquo;t have felt more like an outsider if I had crash-landed from another planet. I just didn&rsquo;t fit in; it was as simple as that. I lacked the pseudo-superior confidence every other kid seemed to be wearing like a cheap paper mask.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was used to living in a town where everyone knew one another. I came from a place where you could walk down the street and always see friendly people passing by with a wave or smile. California was not like this, in fact, I wasn&rsquo;t even sure if many of its inhabitants were human at all. Most of the adults in my new neighborhood seemed less like living beings and more like cold, indifferent machines. All they seemed to care about was the preservation of their vanity, and they kept up the maintenance on that like their ego was a large tapeworm that needed to be constantly nourished. The parasites of greed that lived in their bellies fed off a fancy life style that seemed to give its host a false sense of power and prestige. All of them were just preoccupied with out fancying one another, and their children paid the price for that compulsion. While these idiots were out showing off their expensive new shit, going out for brunch, and cruising around in their flashy new cars their children were turning into monsters right under their up turned noses. I had nothing in common with this strange and ugly place and blending in would be difficult.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the first day of high school, and I wasn&rsquo;t feeling too confident about it. My house was only about a half mile from campus, and as I walked down the sidewalk, I felt less like a schoolboy and more like a condemned prisoner making his long haul toward the gallows. Other kids crowded the streets in small packs headed in the same direction&mdash; some gave me cursory glances while others grinned like hungry wolves. They could tell I didn&rsquo;t belong&mdash;they could smell it on me like fresh meat. A large cushion of space surrounded me; no one wanted to get too close to the new kid in case his awkwardness was contagious. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I crept though the gates of Oak Hill, I was filled with a sickening sense of dread&hellip;<em>this was gonna be a bad day. </em>To my left, a group of jocks were huddled in conversation joking and laughing with one another. As I entered through the gates, their laughter ceased, and they all turned to meet my gaze. They looked like human advertisements. They were all wearing Nike baseball caps, and each had on different sports jerseys with their favorite logo printed across the chest. <em>If they wore black suits and swastika armbands they wouldn&rsquo;t have looked much different.</em> Each one gave me an icy stare as they scanned me from head to toe, then in unison they let out a distasteful grunt and went about their business. As I began to move on, one of them flashed me a shark-like smile and gave me a wink, letting me know we&rsquo;d see each other again real soon. <em>Dead man walking&hellip;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The locker compound was confined to say the least. Kids were packed in like sardines, pushing and clawing their way through walls of bodies like savage animals. I didn&rsquo;t feel up to lugging my backpack around all day, so I pushed myself through a wave of flesh trying to find my locker. Kids shoved me this way and that as I struggled to keep my footing in the midst of the stampede. I franticly scanned the lockers looking for number 1138, but it was hard to keep focus with people slamming into me from every possible direction. My eyes finally rested on the numbers as I saw a short kid with sandy blond hair loading books into my locker. This came as no surprise, because I knew I&rsquo;d be sharing a locker with someone, it said so in the orientation letter I&rsquo;d received a few weeks earlier. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hi&hellip; um, I guess I&rsquo;m sharing a locker with you,&rdquo; I said meekly as I began to remove my backpack.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kid ceased his rummaging, and stared at me blankly. Unlike most the looks I&rsquo;d gotten that morning, his stare seemed to be one of indifference rather than malice, and for this I was thankful. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo; I&rsquo;m Christian.&rdquo; I said quietly, trying to fill the void of uncomfortable silence. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>So?</em>&rdquo; He replied bitterly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a fuck if you&rsquo;re Christian. <em>What has that got to do with anything?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>&ldquo;No&hellip; um, you don&rsquo;t understand. That&rsquo;s my name. My name is Christian.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he squinted his eyes to inspect me closer. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not your fault then. I guess we should blame your parents for giving you a fucked up name, huh?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the most amazing thing happened&mdash;<em>I laughed</em>. An actual real laugh too, not a forced one. For the first time that morning I didn&rsquo;t feel miserable and trapped. As if the first miracle wasn&rsquo;t enough, the boy extended his hand and introduced himself. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How ya doing?&rdquo; He asked, gripping my hand. &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Kelly.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had to hold back the urge to make a comment, because his name seemed a lot more fucked up than mine&mdash;at least I didn&rsquo;t have a girl&rsquo;s name.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re my new locker partner, huh?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, it looks that way.&rdquo; I responded dumbly as I fumbled with the zipper on my backpack. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t take up much space. I don&rsquo;t have a lot of stuff.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelly was short, but thick with an athletic build. He had straggly sun-bleached hair, and cool blue eyes. His face was perfectly chiseled around the cheeks and nose; he had that typical Californian look I was becoming familiar with. His skin was darkly toasted with a tan and he smelled of salt water, as if he&rsquo;d been to the beach earlier that morning. &ldquo;Surfer boy&rdquo; was definitely written all over his face. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stuffed my belongings into the locker, I could see him sizing me up out of the corner of my eye.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You surf?&rdquo; He asked, as he looked me over. &ldquo;Cuz I ain&rsquo;t never seen you around here, and you sure as fuck don&rsquo;t look like you surf.&rdquo; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;N-no&hellip; I don&rsquo;t. Why do you ask?&rdquo; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelly gave me a cynical smirk and shook his head slowly from side to side.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re a poser then, <em>is that it?</em>&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was baffled. I had no idea what he was talking about. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo; </em>I stupidly replied. &ldquo;No&hellip; um, I&rsquo; m not sure what you mean.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A poser&hellip; <em>that&rsquo;s what ya are right?</em> I mean you&rsquo;re wearing a T&amp;C surf shirt, and you don&rsquo;t surf. So that means you&rsquo;re a fuckin&rsquo; poser, <em>right?</em>&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I absently looked down at the front of my T-shirt&mdash;it was one of the many new shirts my mother had bought me for school. The shirt was red with a small yin-yang symbol stitched on the left breast. I&rsquo;d picked a few of these shirts when I went clothes shopping, because I liked the symbol on them. The yin-yang reminded me of all the cheesy ninja movies I loved to watch as a kid. I was clueless to the fact that they were surf clothes, and I sure as hell didn&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;d be branded a &ldquo;poser&rdquo; if I wore them. I didn&rsquo;t even know what a goddamn poser was for Christ&rsquo;s sakes!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know this was a surf shirt.&rdquo; I replied as I felt my cheeks flush with embarrassment. &ldquo;And no&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a poser either.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This last statement must have tickled him, because Kelly burst out with hysterical laughter. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t from around here, are ya?&rdquo; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What gave me away?&rdquo; I responded sarcastically.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Awright, if you can pass this test there may be hope for you yet. What do ya think of Inxs?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He watched me with excited anticipation. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s <em>in excess</em>?&rdquo; I replied, with my palms to the sky.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s <em>Inxs</em>?&rdquo; Kelly barked, drawing attention from all sides. &ldquo;Inxs is only the greatest fuckin&rsquo; rock band in the world! Haven&rsquo;t you heard the album <em>Kick</em>? It&rsquo;s all over the charts right now.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just shook my head from side to side.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where ya from man, <em>Mars</em>?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo; Colorado, actually,&rdquo; I replied as a burst of giggles erupted in my right ear.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned, finding a small cluster of Madonna clones huddled nearby watching me. They were all wearing lacey, elbow length gloves with dozens of cheap bracelets running up their arms. They even had penciled in beauty marks over their upper lips. They looked like fuckin&rsquo; clowns&hellip; <em>and they had the nerve to laugh at me?</em> I swallowed the rage that rose in my throat like bile, and turned back around to face Kelly. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey man, you&rsquo;re kind of a barn dude.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Was this guy speaking English, or what?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>&ldquo;Ya better get with the program, or ya ain&rsquo;t gonna last too long around here. I gotta get ta class&mdash;<em>later man</em>.&rdquo; And on that note, Kelly was gone. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I closed up my locker, and folded my notebook under my arm. Suddenly, the first bell sounded. I flinched in surprise, dropping my notebook. The Madonna clones broke into a fresh burst of giggles as they watched me stoop down to retrieve my belongings. The bile of repression I was holding in my guts began to rise up in my throat again. I was angry with my mother for making me come here. I was angry at being born. But most of all, I was angry with myself for not fitting in, and these girls snickering at me didn&rsquo;t help at all. It was like they were rubbing my nose in my own awkwardness, much like you&rsquo;d rub a puppy&rsquo;s nose in a pile of fresh dog shit. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My stomach tightened as something primal snapped inside my skull.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Hey! Material girls!&rdquo;</em> I shouted, spinning around to face them. They immediately ceased their cackling, staring at me like a pack of startled mongrels. <em>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go choke on a dick? Join the fuckin&rsquo; circus or something?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Two of them stood gawking with their mouths hanging open, while the other two cursed quietly under their breath. I sulked off to my first period class. I was exhausted, beaten down, broken, and it was only the beginning of the day.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students had a five-minute gap between first bell and second, thus giving them enough time to get where they needed to be. When the first bell rang you knew you had five minutes to get to class, and by second bell your ass was supposed to be in a desk. The campus was so huge and foreign to me that five minutes wasn&rsquo;t enough time to find my destination. I strolled into math class a few minutes after the second bell sounded&mdash;that just seemed to be the way my luck was going. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I opened the door in the middle of roll call, and the whole class swiveled around to pierce me with their eyes. With the door ajar, I stood frozen for a moment, staring back at the nameless faces in front of me. The teacher lifted his eyes from the attendance sheet in his hand and frowned at me from across the room. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you gonna stand in the doorway all day, or are you gonna join the rest of us?&rdquo; He asked bitterly.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class rippled quietly with laughter as I hopped over to an empty desk. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;As you can see, we&rsquo;re in the middle of checking attendance. Since you were incapable of being on time, I may have already called your name.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher spoke to me slowly and clearly like I was retarded.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So if you would be so kind as to give me your name, I could check you off my list here. Unless of course, you don&rsquo;t mind being absent today.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class once again rippled with laughter, and the teacher smiled proudly, happy with himself for embarrassing me. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Christian Smock, sir.&rdquo; I replied in a deflated tone.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Christian <em>Shmock, </em>huh?&rdquo; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Smock actually, sir&hellip; there&rsquo;s no &lsquo;H&rsquo; in my last name.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well&hellip; forgive me, I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; he said as he batted his eyelashes in mock sincerity. &ldquo;My humblest apologies, it won&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay, sir. You don&rsquo;t have to make a big deal out of it.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again a ripple of giggles spread throughout the room, but this time they weren&rsquo;t laughing at me, and this time the teacher wasn&rsquo;t smiling like the village idiot either. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>QUIET!</em>&rdquo; He shouted. The veins bulged out on the side of his head, and at that moment he looked like a giant engorged penis.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The classroom fell instantly silent as kids shifted uneasily in their seats.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So&hellip; Mr. <em>Shmock </em>seems to be the new class comedian. There&rsquo;s always at least one. I&rsquo;ve discovered you early this year&mdash;it being the first day and all.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He eyeballed me sternly as I slid down in my seat trying to hide. I was making friends all over the place today. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, Mr. <em>Shmock</em>, my name&rsquo;s Mr. <em>Myers</em>.&rdquo; He said as he stood up and walked to the head of the class. &ldquo;In case you haven&rsquo;t noticed, this is <em>my</em> classroom, and I&rsquo; m not about to take any crap from some punk kid. <em>Do you understand me?</em>&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;yes, sir&hellip;&rdquo; I mumbled, intently studying my desktop.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Excuse me?</em> I didn&rsquo;t quite get that. Could you speak up?&rdquo; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lifted my head from the desk, and locked eyes with him. I tried to keep a cold look on my face, but I&rsquo; m not sure if it worked. It was tough keeping eye contact with the beady-eyed son of a bitch.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, sir. I understand you perfectly clear, sir.&rdquo; I could tell I managed to speak with an undercurrent of venom, and that made me proud. I knew he heard it in my voice too, because his face twisted up like he had something sour in his mouth. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Good&hellip; since it&rsquo;s the first day of school I&rsquo;ll let you slide on your tardiness. I&rsquo;m being merciful mind you&mdash;<em>so don&rsquo;t let it happen again. </em>You&rsquo;re already on my list Mr. <em>Shmock&mdash;</em>you may want to keep that in mind as well.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Myers paused, waiting for me to respond.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you, sir. I will be sure to keep that in mind, sir.&rdquo; I&rsquo; m not sure it was the kind of reply he was after, because I could see his lips moving slightly as I spoke, but no words were coming out. I think he was cursing me under his breath, much like the Madonna clones before him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy we understand each other.&rdquo; He looked anything but happy. &ldquo;This situation has brought about a perfect opportunity for me to address all of you on the way in which I run my class.&rdquo; As he spoke he scanned the whole room, making everyone cringe back from his gaze. &ldquo;I was a Marine sergeant for many years before I became a teacher, and I run my classroom just like I ran my platoon. I went two tours in Vietnam&mdash;<em>so believe me</em>&mdash;I&rsquo; m not intimidated by a bunch of ninth-graders.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked around the room as he spoke, and saw old photographs pinned all over the walls. Pictures of Mr. Myers posing with his M-16, as other soldiers milled around, all of them grinning from ear to ear. Speaking of ears, he probably had an ear necklace tucked under his jacket to remind him of the good ol&rsquo; days&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t have put it passed him. There were other pictures too, of him hanging out the top of a tank, and others with his arms wrapped around young pretty Asian girls. There was also a huge lamented quote on the wall, which read, <strong>&ldquo;IT IS FAR BETTER TO BE FEARED THAN LOVED.&rdquo;</strong> I knew then that we were all in a lot of trouble&mdash;<em>this guy was definitely a fruitcake.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m gonna write down the five main rules of my class on the blackboard, and I want all of you to copy them in your notebooks for future reference.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Myers turned to the chalkboard and began to write.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could see the angry frustrated soldier in hi m now. I&rsquo;m surprised I didn&rsquo;t catch it before. He had the stereotypical crewcut, and his suit was immaculate&mdash;as if he had spent all morning ironing it like an obsessive-compulsive freak. His shoes were polished to perfection too&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure he could see his fuckin&rsquo; reflection in them. He was dressed like a cadet waiting for the goddamn general to come in and do an inspection. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suddenly had the feeling of being watched. I looked directly across from me to the left, and sure enough some kid was sitting there grinning at me. He had short black hair, and his face was covered in greasy acne. His eyes were glazed and bright red; he was definitely on something. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey&hellip; watch this&hellip;&rdquo; The pizza-faced freak whispered with a sloppy grin. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Rule number one,&rdquo; Mr. Myers called out as he wrote on the blackboard. &ldquo;Tardiness will not be tolerated!&rdquo; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>FUCK YOUR RULES!</em>&rdquo; The pizza-faced freak spat venomously.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was completely shocked; my mouth hung agape in disbelief. The rest of the class began to murmur amongst themselves. Mr. Myers still had his back to us, and everyone tensed up as we watched his shoulders hunch over in rage. Without warning, he spun on his heels and lashed out with his right hand, flinging his chalk across the room. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>YOU!</em>&rdquo; He shouted, pointing his finger at me like a loaded gun.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt a tremor begin to spread out from my chest into the rest of my limbs. <em>Oh God, he&rsquo;s gonna kill me</em>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Out of my classroo m now, Shmock!&rdquo;</em> He yelled as his beady eyes bulged from their sockets. <em>&ldquo;Go to the office, and don&rsquo;t bother ever coming back!&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>No problem, I thought as I jumped to my feet and scooped up my notebook. I glanced over to the pizza-faced kid and he shrugged his shoulders, mouthing the word &ldquo;sorry.&rdquo; He had nothing to apologize for; in retrospect he did me a favor. At least I didn&rsquo;t have to be in Sgt. Rock&rsquo;s class anymore. All these other kids were trapped&mdash;<em>the</em><em>poor bastards</em>. I bolted for the door, and as I made my escape, I could hear Mr. Myers shout after me. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Good riddance, to ya! You little creep!&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>On my way to the office I decided I&rsquo;d had enough of school. It was only 8:00 am, but I was wiped out. I decided to leave, and I didn&rsquo;t give two shits about the repercussions. I exited through the same gates I&rsquo;d just entered a little under an hour ago. As I slipped away I felt a spasm of relief shake through me&mdash;<em>I was free.</em> I walked in the opposite direction from my house; I couldn&rsquo;t go back there until school was out, and I didn&rsquo;t really want to anyway. I felt just as lost at home as I did at school&mdash;there was truly no sanctuary. I just studied the sidewalk as I walked aimlessly with no destination. I didn&rsquo;t want to think anymore. I was tried of existing.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, man!&rdquo; Someone suddenly shouted.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I snapped my head up to find a kid with straggly dark hair, sitting partially hidden in some nearby bushes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Wanna get Irie?&rdquo; He asked with a wide grin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t get what he was saying, but he held up his hand and I saw a joint burning between his fingers. I think I was beginning to understand him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ya wanna get high, or what?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pondered the invite a moment, and then decided, &ldquo;What the fuck?&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I crawled into the bushes I knew I was crossing some boundary. I knew this was the first step into becoming a monster like the rest of them, but I didn&rsquo;t care. The joint may as well have been the elixir that transformed Jekyll into Hyde&mdash;it was going to change me, and I knew it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put the joint between my lips as butterfly wings fluttered against the lining of my belly. I inhaled deeply, and felt the evils of California rush through my lungs and possess my brain. That shy innocent mountain boy slowly began to fade into a dull blur. I was already becoming one of them. I blew out the hit, and felt all my tension leave with it. I was reborn&mdash;<em>blank.</em> I knew in time I&rsquo;d blend in with the rest.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew soon enough, I&rsquo;d belong.</p>
