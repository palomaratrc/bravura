&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just tell me,&quot; I said. &quot;I'm not going to be angry. I need to know. It's OK. Don't worry about me getting angry or hurting my feelings.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was lying on her side, her back to me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It wasn't bad,&quot; she said. &quot;It's never bad.&quot; Her voice was low: only partially because she wasn't facing me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; I said. My fingers continued crumpling the sheets. She turned to face me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm going to ask you something now,&quot; she said, taking one of my hands into hers and squeezing it before letting it drop. &quot;And I don't want you to tell me what you think I want to hear. Just say the truth.&quot; She talked without any edge in her voice. She was calm and in control. &quot;Is it me?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's me.&quot; I squeezed the sheets, making a fist.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So what's going on then?&quot; she said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tension began to build inside me: there was a tightness in my throat.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I've told you before,&quot; I said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before she spoke, she propped her head up on her hand. Her fingertips were moving back and forth over the sheets. &quot;You told me you were married. You were in the army. It ended badly. That doesn't tell me much,&quot; she said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What more do you want to know?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I want to know why you're so expressionless when we make love,&quot; she said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You want more than I can give. Listen, my brother will be in town all next week. Why don't we take some time apart then?&quot;<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About a year ago when I was still in the military, I was on my lunch break and instead of eating, I went outside and into this forest that surrounded where I worked. The leaves on the trees were green and budding out in anticipation of summer. The sounds of birds mingled with the low whisper of the wind. The wind blew through the leaves of the trees and the hair on my head.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came upon a clearing and a valley of tall, thick grass. There was an old, leaning oak tree at the beginning of the valley where the ground began sloping down. I walked over to the tree and sat up against it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I started thinking. About the divorce. About getting kicked out of the Army. About how I just wanted it all to finally be over. I felt angry that I'd let myself get into such a mess; sad because, though the end was near, it wasn't near enough. And there was this one other feeling. It was a feeling that I cannot name or understand other than that it was like having a large knot in my throat that never went away and served as a constant reminder of all the bad choices I had made in my short tenure as an adult.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother used to say when I was a child that I was nine going on 35; so serious and mature. But now, as an adult, I'm baffled, afraid, and frustrated. It's all so much more difficult than I imagined and I'm afraid to take a step because I might be going in the wrong direction with the wrong person on the wrong day and it's all so overwhelming.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind picked up some strength and changed from a whisper to a murmur. It ran through the tall grass in the valley. You could see each gust as it blew through like invisible fingers through fur.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent my whole lunch break like that. Just sitting there watching the wind and feeling the knot in my throat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my brother arrived, he would spend the days with our family and the evenings and nights with me at my place.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first night he came, I greeted him at the door with a hug. He hugged me back, in a very gentle way, and made his way over to the couch. I noticed a certain awkward cautiousness about the way he walked as if my living room was some strange foreign land.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How are the rangers treating you? Like being a medic?&quot; I said following him, &quot;how was Afghanistan? Think we'll be successful over there?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He scratched at the corner of his face where he hadn't shaven, no doubt, since he went on leave. Though his face looked dry and callous, he still looked young; young, but without that annoying twinkle in the eyes, &quot;Maybe. After a generation. Who knows?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes looked forward at the television and the video game system before it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You mind?&quot; he asked, motioning toward the video game system.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Go ahead,&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was nine my dad took my older brother and me on this camping trip up to Yosemite national park. We had hiked up the upper falls and crab walked out to the edge on our hands and feet so we wouldn't slip. After many years of water flowing through the upper falls, the rock had been smoothed out into this slippery, shiny kind of granite that glistened in the afternoon sunlight. A little stream trickled over this rock before meeting its fate: a half a mile drop on to more granite below.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Can I look?&quot; my older brother said to my dad who was currently inspecting the edge.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad didn't respond at first. He had told us we were going to look over the falls. Now I think he was having second thoughts.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Dad!&quot; my older brother said again.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Christ. What the hell is the matter with you? Hold on a second.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad's voice had an edge to it. He was angered, I think, not because my brother was being impatient, but because he was scared-and my brother was not.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad backed away from the edge and let my brother slide forward on his belly and look over while we held onto his legs.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Coming back up?&quot; I said impatiently.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;OK,&quot; he said, sliding back away from the edge.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes were wide and bright like headlights. &quot;Damn,&quot; he said. Then he turned to look at me, &quot;Your turn.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got down on my belly and slid over to the edge, putting my fingers on the smooth, warm granite. I felt two hands grasp my pants at my ankles.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Go slow,&quot; my dad said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt the flutterings of butterflies in my stomach, with each step, increasing in intensity.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then my head was over the edge and I stared down at the waterfall below me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, I remember seeing water falling down, dissipating into little puffs of mist before splattering on the granite below. I remember seeing a small town in a large valley that spanned from one end of view to the other, surrounded by green furry sequoia treetops. There were little puffs of smoke coming from the chimneys and the golden glow of firelight flickering in the windows. I remember the sun, just a slice still visible over the mountains behind the town. Those mountains spanned farther off into the distance than the valley. They spanned into a place I had never been before and whose meaning seemed ambiguous and made me apprehensive. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said: &quot;Holy shit.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My brother and I spent the evenings of his leave time in my living room. I would sit next to him and watch as he played video games-a fair space between the two of us of course. At first we were both silent; shocked by how unfamiliarly familiar we both were with one another.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second evening, I said to him while he played video games, &quot;I told her we should spend some time apart this week.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised an eyebrow.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I just can't seem to pull my shit together.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was like talking to a wall with my brother playing video games.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And I have no idea what I should do,&quot; I said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't stop playing video games even to look at me. He just kept playing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third evening he was a lot more talkative. He showed me his pictures-pictures of him and the guys in his unit in Afghanistan; pictures of them shooting at ranges; a picture of a guy calling in artillery support on this old olive drab radio with a long floppy antenna. Another was a picture of my brother playing poker with some friends. He had a sawed off shotgun in his left hand, and the cards in his right. He also had a big grin on his face. One of the other guys he was playing with had a 240 machine gun.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Probably don't have much trouble with people cheating,&quot; I said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nope.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We continued looking at the pictures. Occasionally he would say, &quot;yeah this guy here is my friend,&quot; or &quot;man, I hate that guy, he's a fucking dumbshit.&quot; When he said these things I would look at him and just stare and listen to each word as it flowed from his lips into my ears.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped on one of the pictures for a long time. It was a picture of a casket with an American flag draped over it. The casket was being carried off into a Blackhawk helicopter. My brother just stared at the picture, blinking his eyes. Then he said, real quickly, &quot;Guy got smashed by a Humvee. I had to work on him.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My brother held up his wrist, revealing a small, thin silver bracelet with a name and date engraved on it. Also engraved were the letters: &quot;K.I.A.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So what's it like in Afghanistan?&quot; I asked him on the next evening while he played video games.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't say anything. His eyes remained mesmerized by the television.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey!&quot; I said, waving my hand in front of his face, &quot;Hello?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;One sec,&quot; he said. &quot;Let me finish this part.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment later he paused the game and said:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well. To be honest, it's a lot like here. Climate wise and scenery wise. Except that over there there are huge snowcapped mountains-the Himalayas. And at night it gets a lot darker. Real dark. We could barely use night vision because there was so little ambient light.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sat there in silence; then I asked, &quot;What about the Afghani people?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Hajis? Yeah. No one calls them Afghans. You call 'em Hajis. Don't ask me why. They're all right people. The little kids are real cool. They come running up to you and ask if you're an infidel. So I'd say, 'hell yea, I'm an infidel! And I'm gonna get you!' and I've got my M4 slung over my arm and grenades strapped to my chest, so these little kids go running away screaming bloody murder. So I'd run back up to them grab 'em and say 'just kidding!'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The older ones didn't like us so much. We were always doing operations at night time. Snatching up people that we thought might be Taliban or part of the old warlord tribes. So I can understand their suspicion. These people have never really even seen electricity-let alone a bunch of spooky guys walking around at night with green night vision circles around their eyes. They don't know anything about physics or anything, so to them it's just evil infidel magic. Plus, most of them were educated at these religious schools that were quasi terrorist training grounds. So the little that they know about the West, is mostly bad.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never asked my brother if he killed anyone while he was over there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the next, and second to last evening, my brother was playing video games, pressing away at the buttons of the controller, eyes again mesmerized by the television, when I said:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey. Let's go get drunk. I'll call in sick to work.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was already turning everything off by the time the words left my mouth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an old clich&eacute; about people in the military: that they drink more than anyone else. This is true. Especially with my brother.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why do people drink so much in the military?&quot; I asked him after we were at the bar, the both of us good and drunk.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Because,&quot; he replied, &quot;there's nothing else to fuggin' do. You've been to Army towns.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was intended to be a question. I nodded.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well then you know. It's enough to make you wanna drink. So we do.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his long island ice tea. We toasted. To what? I don't remember. After we toasted, he said, &quot;If there was something better to do, I...I would do it.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I saw her enter the bar. She was wearing jeans and a T-shirt.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey,&quot; I said to my brother. &quot;It's her. The girl I told you about.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at me through glassy eyes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We met at this bar, on this day, awhile back.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You met today? I thought you said you been seeing this girl a long time.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, I mean she always comes in on this day of the week at this bar and, awhile back, I came in at the same time, and that's how we met. We had a drink together.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hi, can I talk to you for a second?&quot; she said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went to the back by the pay phone and bathrooms.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I just wanted to come by and tell you something. I thought you should know that I really, really liked you.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She put her fingers out and touched my elbow.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're a good guy,&quot; she said. &quot;You just seem distant.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could hardly look at her. She said:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I just wonder what you're like when the clouds have gone away. I bet it's something.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gave me a little peck on the cheek and was gone. I returned to my seat and motioned for the bartender.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Double vodka,&quot; I said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender gave me a drink. This glass was taller than previous glasses. I picked it up from the top and clenched it tightly as if controlling the moment, the drink, and the intoxication it promised might help me to establish some control over my life.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real loss occurs when you give a part of yourself to something, and that something is taken away or disappears. It could be a job, an ideal, or a woman. If you love something and you lose it-that's real loss, and it's like losing an arm. Only instead of a missing limb, you lose a part of your soul. You can tell because after it's gone you can feel this huge vacuum inside. That vacuum inside is your mind's unwillingness to accept the loss. And when you try to introduce substitutes-like a new woman-your mind will spot them immediately and reject them just like physical organ recipients that don't take their pills. But with real loss, the only pill is time. Time, and maybe some double vodkas.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't even realize I was getting so upset by thinking about all this, so when the glass in my hand broke, I was surprised. I'm not a violent person. It's just not in my nature.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, the glass broke and some pieces stuck into my vodka drenched hand. A small stream of blood oozed from my hand on to the floor. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, what the hell? Are you OK? What happened?&quot; my brother said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't know. It just broke.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender came over and asked what happened. I told him how sorry I was. The bartender said everything was alright, but suggested that maybe I should go home and give alcohol a rest. He gave me some paper towels to wrap around my hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the last evening of my brother's stay, he took me into the bathroom and put some of this clear gelly, goopy crap on my cut hand.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It'll heal faster like this,&quot; he said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sat in there and, as he put that gunk on my hand, he said:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That guy that got stuck under the Humvee,&quot; he raised the silver bracelet he had shown me earlier, &quot;there was nothing I could do for him. I knew as soon as I saw him that he was dead. I mean he was still alive when I started working on him, but he was going to die no matter what I did. We were out on patrol, driving around in our Humvees. The driver couldn't see jack shit. Too dark. He couldn't see that he was driving their Humvee off a cliff. This guy,&quot; he said jiggling the silver bracelet, &quot;was thrown from the Humvee and then it rolled on top of him. Took forever just to find where they were. Even the driver didn't know where the hell they were. It took even longer to get that Humvee off the poor guy. And when we did, he was just smashed. An entire Humvee,&quot; my brother's voice faded. He resumed: &quot;We brought him in to the medical tent. I was holding his head up to keep his spine immobile and his brains started coming out.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't look sad. Well maybe a little, but it was more than that. His eyes just stared down at the ground vacantly.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't know what to say. So I reached out with my hand-the hand with the cut and goopy crap-I reached out and set my hand on his shoulder. I squeezed my brother with the tips of my fingers; a soft squeeze: a whisper.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't say anything. He just kept staring at the ground with those vacant eyes. Then I asked him if he remembered the time when we went to Yosemite and looked over the falls. He said that he had. He said:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I just about shit myself looking over those falls.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Funny,&quot; I said, &quot;I always thought you weren't scared.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the silver bracelet on his wrist. He cocked it back and forth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That was when it was fun to be scared,&quot; he said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither of us said anything for a long time. Then I rose to my feet and went into the kitchen.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I began rummaging through my sparsely populated liquor cabinet.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All I've got is vodka,&quot; I yelled.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's fine,&quot; he said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ice?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No ice.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came into the kitchen with me as I was pouring our glasses. I finished pouring and picked the glass up and handed it to him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;To being scared shitless,&quot; I said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes didn't look so vacant now. Instead, I thought I sensed the slightest hue of amusement.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;To being scared shitless,&quot; he said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We raised our glasses, took a swig, and felt the burn trickle down our throats.</p>
