        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elliot P. Shelby, neither a great encyclopedia salesman nor a gambler of any renown beyond the Craps tables at the Flamingo Hotel, strains to read the tin sign of this desert town in the predawn light. He rubs the bruised jaw Tommy and Lou had stamped onto his face just six hours prior &ndash; a parting gift from the two mobsters that stirred him from his unconscious state when he yawned and found himself propped against the side of a white ranch house. Those two had seen fit to leave the salesman with the gold watch he had won back in their little poker game two nights ago, the reasons for which have yet to dawn upon the disoriented Mr. Shelby.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning from the sign he scans the homes of this rural community before diving to the ground. Mr. Shelby squints through wiry glasses, trying to discern the identity of the silhouette with the fedora hat standing in the center of the dirt avenue. He is too skinny to be Lou, but the lanky features and posture fit Tommy&rsquo;s profile well. In either case, he would be armed. The figure makes no move to approach Mr. Shelby or draw a gun. He must not have seen him. Luck would appear to be on the salesman&rsquo;s side, unlike the past few weeks.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr. Shelby was forced to put his gold watch down as collateral during Tommy and Lou&rsquo;s poker game, he found the reputations these two thugs carried as ruthless gangsters and even more ruthless card players to be on the money. Getting his cherished keepsake back from possession of the Flamingo Hotel lead Mr. Shelby to the pockets of Vic the loan shark. The interest rates Vic demands would certainly break a man&rsquo;s wallet before Vic himself got around to break the same man&rsquo;s legs. As for the salesman&rsquo;s legs, he made sure to move those as far from Vegas as he could after using the thousand he borrowed from the loan shark to get his watch back in that crooked poker game. Mr. Shelby had a good head start along the interstate with the watch and ten thousand dollars of the casino&rsquo;s money before Tommy and Lou, both <em>shareholders</em> of the Flamingo Hotel, discovered the salesman&rsquo;s spare aces stacked in the deck. Had he not stayed so long at that dive motel along the 95, Mr. Shelby might have made it out of Nevada instead of being roughed-up and deposited in this dusty little suburb.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure in the fedora hat remains perfectly still for two minutes before Mr. Shelby summons what little nerve he has and approaches the silhouette. In the growing light a polished luster is given off from the man&rsquo;s expressionless face. He makes no move when Mr. Shelby approaches, taps his shoulder, and accidentally tips him to the ground. This mannequin stares up at the salesman from the desert floor, offering a silent greeting to his community.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun rises.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Shelby shakes his head and scans the houses once more till his eyes fall upon the sign he was attempting to read earlier, its message now clear in the morning light. <em>Welcome to Doom Town , Nevada,</em> the white spray paint proudly displays. <em>Population: 35. Est. October 25 th 1952. Date of detonation: March 17, 1953</em><em>0900 hours. Have a nice day! </em>The artist of this painstaking work had taken it upon himself to fill each O in <em>Doom</em> with a radiation hazard symbol. The numbness Mr. Shelby exhibits towards this placard settles upon him as a precursor to a terrifying realization.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were times in the past few months when his moments of quiet remorse losing chip after chip at the Blackjack table had been interrupted by bright flashes over the desert horizon. Sometimes there were booms that would cause the windows of the casino to shatter, and the chaos presented the desperate little man with an opportunity to seize some of his losses while the dealer ducked to the floor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fishes the watch from his brown tweed jacket. <em>Mar. 17 6:47 am</em>. Perhaps the incomprehensible nature of the current situation is too great or Tommy and Lou had simply hit Mr. Shelby one too many times in the head, but it takes another rotation of the minute hand before the salesman comes to an undeniable conclusion. Fallen arches may have kept him from serving his country in the war and becoming a soldier, but even <em>he</em> knew of what was routinely unleashed 65 miles north of the strip on the wastes of the Yucca Flats. Volume A in the Montigo encyclopedia set describes it best:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>The atomic bomb:</em><em> An extremely powerful explosive device in which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;energy is released from the fission of either uranium or plutonium.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See also: The pinnacle </em><em>of man&rsquo;s ultimate disregard for himself.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Of the six houses lined-up on the unpaved dirt lane of Doom Town Main Street, the always observant Mr. Shelby runs towards the white ranch house he awoke next to that morning. The salesman stops himself before ringing the doorbell, an occupational habit. The inhabitants of this fine community do not need hairbrushes, vacuum cleaners, or an informative set of encyclopedias, or at least they won&rsquo;t in another 131 minutes. <em>6:49 am.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Mr. Shelby walks in on the residents of house number four during a rather private moment in their finely furnished bedroom. The male mannequin with his anatomically incorrect pelvis thrust on top of his wife&rsquo;s plastic groin drives Mr. Shelby to quickly exit this mad scene of passion with a blush before he takes another furtive glance inside. So these were the type of inhabitants that call this condemned township home. The ever-smiling fashion models from a JC Penney&rsquo;s department store were called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice but would spend their last few hours wrapped in a loving embrace. Given the circumstances, Mr. Shelby might envy them. <em>6:52 am</em><em>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The salesman finds the contents of #4&rsquo;s garage to be far from facsimile. A brand new 1953 Chevrolet 4-door Coup would provide a fast means of escape from Doom Town, provided that there were keys in the ignition, or the glove compartment, or under the seats, or in the dashboard Mr. Shelby repeatedly pounds his fists on in frustration till they become sore. He repeats this same futile process with the cars in the garages of #5, 6, 3, 2, and 1 before taking a long, hard look at the stretch of badlands between him and Interstate 95 twelve miles to the south. <em>7:09 am.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>With a lack of options and the intense heat of the Nevada sun bearing down on him like an unpaid debt, Mr. Shelby wanders into house #1 on Doom Town Avenue. Mr. and Mrs. Mannequin remain oblivious to the stifling paint fumes that cause their uninvited guest to gag. He helps himself to one of Mr. Mannequin&rsquo;s warm beers from an unplugged fridge and has a seat with the charming plastic couple in their living room. He just needs time to get his thoughts straight, to think of a way out. It won&rsquo;t take long, just a quick rest and a friendly chit-chat with the dollhouse family next door. <em>7:12 am.</em> Little Mannequin Jr. reaches towards the door with his school books and a lunch lovingly prepared by Mrs. Mannequin who was in turn lovingly prepared to meet an unavoidable fate in less than two hours. They are a lot like Mr. Shelby&rsquo;s family, except that he has a daughter that would not remember him, and a wife that smokes while waiting by the phone for Mr. Shelby to call. She would also be waiting for that envelope of money he should be sending her so that she in turn could lovingly prepare a lunch for their daughter. Mrs. Abigail Shelby must have been waiting for that next call for almost a year now. The salesman shoves Mr. Mannequin from the couch and has a seat next to Mrs. Mannequin. Had her hair been spray-painted brown instead of yellow she would look like Abby. <em>7:20 am</em><em>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Mr. Shelby puts a perspiring arm around his new friend, takes a peek beneath her dress at a pair of less-than-supple thighs, and lets the dress fall back down with a sigh. The salesman used to share moments such as these with other Mrs. Mannequins, <em>before</em> he was married to Abby. Many of these women were glad for the company of a handsome visitor while Mr. Mannequin was serving in the war, some showing their appreciation beyond the purchase of a few books. For his brave and selfless acts in selling over fifty encyclopedia sets to the lonely housewives of Spokane, Washington, this salesman was rewarded by the Montigo Trading Company with the same gold watch he habitually checks now. <em>7:27 am</em><em>.</em> He puts a finger over the vein in his wrist. A pulse rate of 72 beats per minute with approximately 89 minutes left would mean the always-cunning Mr. Shelby has 6,408 heart beats left. 6,407&hellip;.6,406&hellip;6,405..6,404.6,403. His heart rate speeds up and throws his calculations off. He removes his tweed jacket and drapes it over Mrs. Mannequin before going outside again. Mr. Shelby can&rsquo;t smell the paint fumes anymore, but this house makes him sick. <em>7:42 am<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>When he started changing hotels every week, Mrs. Shelby couldn&rsquo;t reach him anymore. Phone calls are made on Mr. Shelby&rsquo;s terms. After all, he is in Nevada for <em>her</em>. Trying to make a sale when the income of his family relied on a salesman&rsquo;s commission had made Mr. Shelby&rsquo;s stuttering come back, a speech impediment he thought he had overcome when he was ten. Not even the widowed Mrs. Mannequin was interested in an <em>Encyclop-p-p-p-edia</em><em>set.</em> Las Vegas is far enough from Spokane for Mr. Shelby, and the rich spenders make it easy to sell almost anything; vacuums, books, brushes, etc. Gambling is even easier for the salesman. Relying on his luck for an income instead of his less than savvy negotiation skills made his stuttering cease, to a point. <em>7:46 am</em><em>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Gambling is easy for Mr. Shelby, but stopping isn&rsquo;t. He sends portions of his well-earned winnings up to Mrs. Shelby when he can. Mr. Shelby considers himself a devoted husband. It has been awhile since his last contribution to Abigail, but she would understand. She understood when he told her that he needed to leave Washington to earn his commission, that he needed to be on his own and he wouldn&rsquo;t be back for awhile. Abby cried when Mr. Shelby left, but she understands. After all, he is here in the middle of Doom Town, Nevada with a swollen jaw for <em>her.</em><em>7:49 am</em><em>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Of the many unsold encyclopedias in the salesman&rsquo;s car back at the motel, Volume C, goes into great detail about cheetahs. Across the plains of the African Serengeti these cats are known to reach top speeds of 70 miles per hour. He recalls this passage as he scans the expanse of the Yucca Flats towards the general direction of Interstate 95. <em>7:50 am</em><em>. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Other than a complimentary jacket, there is nothing the salesman can offer the Mannequin household, or the fine people of Doom Town. He saunters into the desert. Mr. Shelby would spend his last hour outside on the open road. He would that is, if he had not just seen the glint of black and yellow metal in distance. <em>8:01 am</em><em>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Montigo&rsquo;s World Encyclopedia, Volume B: Bus; a vehicle of mass transit employed by cities, private organizations, schools and desperate salesman seeking to escape certain demise in less than an hour. The name <em>Lit&rsquo;l Scholar Child Care Pre Schools </em>spans the length of the bus in bold, black letters. Four more Mannequin Juniors line-up patiently, waiting to start their last day of school. The driver greets his new passenger, Mr. Shelby, with the same expression Mr. Mannequin has before he is tossed into the isle. The ignition key is not only present, but it produces a soft purr from the engine when turned by the now giggling Mr. Shelby. He picks up the four students waiting patiently outside and seats them in the front row. They will appreciate the little field trip he is going to take them on today. <em>8:04 am</em>. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Mr. Shelby is going to realize that the name Yucca <em>Flats</em> is not consistent with the part of the desert he is driving through. The rocky terrain jostles his passengers, heaping them into a pile of twisted arms and legs at the back of the bus. Despite the cracked heads and missing limbs they have endured, Mr. Shelby manages to get the students another mile from Doom Town before he fails to see the gaping trench that overturns their escape vehicle. He crawls from the driver&rsquo;s side window and examines the bus. It lies on its side like a wounded animal, its legs still kicking in the air. Sweat and tears stream from Mr. Shelby&rsquo;s face when he gazes in the direction of the interstate, across his personal Serengeti. <em>8:16 am</em><em>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Volume C of the Montigo World Encyclopedia also goes into great detail about the risk a cheetah endures while it sprints. <em>It is possible</em>, this fine tome proclaims, <em>for a cheetah&rsquo;s body to overheat to the point that it can suffer brain damage.</em> This comes to mind for Mr. Shelby as he sprints through the desert, his brain roasting from the pressures of self-preservation. Eleven miles till the interstate. How far away did those duck and cover films say one had to be from the blast to live? <em>8:31 am</em><em>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It had been over a year since he at least called her. Being the great provider that he is, Mr. Shelby&rsquo;s absence has given Abigail more than an ample opportunity to seek out a Mr. Mannequin to provide for their daughter. <em>8:39 am</em><em>.</em> Abby is like a dentist appointment. It&rsquo;s going to hurt, but the longer he continues to put off those calls the worse the pain is going to be. Was it too late already? <em>8:46 am</em>. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Shelby&rsquo;s sprint breaks down into a jog. He inhales oxygen and exhales sobs. <em>8:51 am. </em>Everything his little girl knows about him can be summed up in an occasional phone call and the promise of more money that month. What is Abby going to tell his daughter if he never calls them again? Is he going to be remembered as a deadbeat dad instead of the dead beaten dad he is about to become? Mr. Shelby, above all else, realizes this and to him it is worse than death. After all, he was in Nevada this whole time for <em>them.</em><em>8:54 am</em><em>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The salesman falls onto his side. There is not enough oxygen in this desert to stop the sensation of iron bands from tightening around his chest. The hum of plane engines can just be heard over the rush of blood in his ears. <em>8:55 am</em><em>.</em> He wonders if Tommy and Lou will find the ten grand he had stashed away in his car back at the motel parking lot. All those fifty dollar bills, taped onto the pages of C: cheetah, B: bus, and A: atomic bomb in the unsold encyclopedia sets would be found by those two eventually. Fantasies from an oxygen-starved brain portray Tommy, Lou, and Vic gunning each other down over his fortune. The sound of plane engines is getting louder. <em>8:56 am.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>He stands up. Despite the sweat and dust that stings his eyes and blurs his vision, he has not seen with this much clarity in a long time. <em>8:57 am</em><em>.</em> He was diluting himself back at the Oasis Motel. The decision to return to Abby in Spokane or to just take the money and start over again somewhere else is not as hard for him as he cares to admit. He can&rsquo;t see the B-50 plane, but he cranes his neck back and faces the sky towards the sound of its engines. <em>8:58 am</em><em>.</em> Fate has once again dealt him a bad hand, and yet he cannot bring himself to stop blaming Abigail for robbing him of the Mrs. Mannequins, prestige, and freedom he had during that period in his life <em>before</em> they were married, <em>before</em> their daughter was born. The pain from shame and guilt as he finally admits this is worse than any beating Tommy and Lou could ever have inflicted. <em>8:59 am. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>He lets go of the gold watch. As the trophy of his halcyon days falls to the ground a large object descends from the plane flying over the desert. Elliot was not here in the outskirts of Doom Town, Nevada with a swollen jaw for <em>her</em>. He was here for <em>himself.</em><em>9:00 am</em><em>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>A second sun rises, this one a construct of man instead of God. </p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>* * *</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footage recorded on March 17, 1953 at 0900 hours from the Nevada Proving Grounds reveals a figure standing just two miles from the test site. Before this silhouette is enveloped by the blast, he can be seen with his arms outstretched, reaching towards the sky.</p></td>
