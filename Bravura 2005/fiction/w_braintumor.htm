He&rsquo;s singing songs. Something is wrong.&rdquo; My speech was sporadic and didn&rsquo;t make sense. I thought I was dying. All these words were coming out of my mouth, and they were not making sense to me. I was like a computer shutting down - mumbling and jumbling my words. My mother-in-law decided to take me to the hospital. Even though I was conscious for much the time, I seemed lost. The doctor diagnosed me as having a brain tumor. This diagnosis changed my life for ever. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I graduated from Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington in 1976 with a B.A. degree in Psychology. My scholastic record has always been high; I had a GPA of 3.1. After graduation I came to San Diego and got a job in direct sales in the seafood and beef industry. I was selling to both businesses and the public. From 1976 to 1996 I was awarded Salesman of the Year for each of the three companies that I worked for. However, after working for a company, I decided to start my own seafood business in Oceanside. My business was quite profitable, and I was in this business for eight years. During this time I met my wife, Laura, and we were married on April 8, 1989. I switched my career to advertising sales and was in this business for six years. Toward the end the work began to slow down, and I decided to move on. One month after I left this job, I felt the first symptoms of what was diagnosed as a brain tumor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exact title of my tumor was &ldquo;meningioma on the frontal lobe&rdquo;. The tumor was indenting the brain and took the gray matter off my brain. The tumor was very large and been growing there for quite some time. It was pressed up against the part of my brain that controlled the speech, so they didn&rsquo;t know how well my language functions would perform. My wife thought I was having a nervous breakdown as a result of deep grieving because my dad had just died and my mom had recently been diagnosed with stomach cancer. It was a really bad year. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After running tests on my head, I was informed that I had a brain tumor on the left side of my head. The doctor wanted to take it out the next morning. And I said to the doctor &ldquo;Well, I need to research this first&rdquo; and the doctor said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have time to research it, you&rsquo;ll be dead&rdquo; and my wife said &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand who you are talking to. He&rsquo;s a Wynn. He goes back a long way &ndash; his dad and sister were just like him. He has to read up on everything. He has to research it and be right on it.&rdquo; I agreed with the doctor. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife felt overwhelmed, not knowing if her husband was going to be there for her. Gail and Dan Solway, my sister and brother-in-law came from Simi Valley, as soon as they could. Everybody was worried; they prayed. Laura answered countless calls from friends and family. She didn&rsquo;t have a lot of the answers. It was a very long surgery &ndash; eight hours. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phillip did not know what would happen to me when I was in the hospital, and he was scared. Phillip asked Laura, &ldquo;Is Dad going to die in there?&rdquo; Realizing that he should not come very often, my wife informed me afterward, that he was very scared and anxious. Laura wanted him to see reality, so that he could be reassured, but he was not old enough to understand much of it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in intensive care for a couple of days. Dorothy, my mom, helped out spiritually, financially, and mentally. Laura&rsquo;s mom was getting sick with meniere&rsquo;s disease, a stress disease involving hearing loss and balance. After the operation, I noticed I cried at the most trivial nuisances. For example, my son Phillip brought in to my hospital room a picture he drew of a battle scene from the Civil War. I cried and cried in gratitude, and in pity, for my son&rsquo;s defined anguish. When I heard a particular hymn, I would find myself weeping uncontrollably for no good reason at all. Since my many operations, I still find myself in an emotionally fragile landscape, crying easily, displaying a wide gallery of emotions. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of my right side of my arm had vanished; it was my preferred side. Now that it was lost, I had to learn to write and play basketball left handed. In addition, I had several seizures. The seizures weakened the right side. The worst type was the grand mal seizure. It is a severe form of epilepsy and is characteristic by spasms and jerking and loss of consciousness I had a grand mal seizure at Palomar Hospital, at Fedco (local department store), at Sharp Hospital, and my mom&rsquo;s house in Seattle. They all happened at Christmas time; it is supposed to be the most stressful time of the year. The seizures happened in the first two years after my operation. I haven&rsquo;t had a grand mal seizures in seven years. I was given morphine while in the hospital, and when I went home I was prescribed Vicadin. I was a pretty strong person and didn&rsquo;t take it very often. I was treated for aphasia, which is a condition I still have. My aphasia consists of the words or ideas that are still in my head but are difficult to pull out and communicate with others. An example of this deficit is I now sometimes forget names. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Fall semester of 1999, I started school at Palomar College. Since that time I have accumulated a 4.0 GPA. In the spring of 2004, I received certificates in Graphics Communications Production and Graphics Communications Management. During this ceremony I remember my mom &ndash; that soul force &ndash; bidding me to go forward.</p>
