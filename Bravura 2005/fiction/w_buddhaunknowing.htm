      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man in the button down shirt is watering his forest. His practiced gaze measures each tree individually, ignoring an entire system of irrigation tubing. The pine is dry, he moistens it. The ginkgo has withered leaves which he carefully removes. His fingers feather out the sea glass layers of the juniper branches for the sunshine to reach. He responds to each tree fully before moving to the next, and the afternoon won&rsquo;t fit into measurable time. It is a string of bonsais only.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An avocado tree rests serenely on the bank above him. It is the last of a grove that faded years ago into yesterday. Hummingbirds flit from the great branches to the red sugar water feeder that his wife loved so much. They vibrate Here life, Now life, in their flight. He had dreams of flying too. Appendicitis kept his enlistment in queue, and after the surgery he was drafted as a foot soldier. He accepted, returned, and raised his sons. The man moves to the next tree. He&rsquo;s been watering this oak every day for the past thirty years. <em>Here, Now</em>, his fingers echo.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He adjusts the copper wire that wraps around branches and constricts movement, binds free life. Straighter here, looser there, tighter here. Send the boy across the ocean, twist the wires of uniform and uniformity around him, straighten his arm with a loaded gun. He checks the well fitting coil along a single branch. The limb is springy to his touch, living contained, but un-crippled. Training its shape has made it stronger for its limitations.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Occupation, he slept on the third floor of a department store. He visited the store on his last trip. Its different now, painted over, but still there. He felt the Then and Now both intermingle and pass each other by.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crabapple tree his granddaughter cooed over as a little girl died last summer. The coffee straw watering hoses didn&rsquo;t work while he was out of town, and the roots dried up. He remembers the look of puzzlement she gave him when he told her. In her young eyes, the bonsais are there in the morning and there at night, always. The leaves on the avocado tree are turning brown.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Off to the side in a screened wooden box, spiny green tufts are showing. These are the sprouts emerging from seeds he planted himself two years ago. Red pine. He carried them home like pearls from the island. Growing successes in America are notoriously few and far between. His weather worn fingers brush over the tops of the little sprouts. One day these will be trees.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks to the tree he has laid carefully on the bench. One side of the green plastic pot is carefully labeled <strong>BOH</strong> in white crayon. Breath of Heaven. Her gift is small, just three inches tall, but it blooms all year long&mdash; tiny white flowers that she will admire and exclaim over, just like when she was a little girl. In a quiet tap of approval, he rests his fingers flat on a corner of the sturdy rim. Yes, she will like it. He smiles.</p>
