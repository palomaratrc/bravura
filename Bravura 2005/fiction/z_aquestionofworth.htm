      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell">[ Three quarters gather on the church pew, their metal illuminated by the sun coming through the stained glass. They talk amongst themselves when they notice a smaller fellow.]
        <p>George 1965: Why, hello Franklin? Why, you look tired my friend, what happened to you? <br>
            <br>
  [A Franklin 1975 mint is turned at angle.]</p>
        <p>George 1980: What? Are you snubbing us? All we said was, hello.</p>
        <p>Franklin 1975: [Stern looking] Sorry, fellow George. I'm just dizzy. The kid over there spun me around in a circle. It's really hard to turn around by ones-self.</p>
        <p>George 1981: True, true, [Light reflects off the third George&rsquo;s head.] But you're lighter than us, so why don't you try?</p>
        <p>Franklin 1975: Okay [After much effort Franklin turns around.] That really twists your neck. </p>
        <p> [Franklin looks up.] Ahh! There are three of you!</p>
        <p> [Being surrounded by three similar looking men makes Franklin anxious. Also he is aware of his small stature and this makes him feel cornered. Not feeling that he could interrupt this group, he thinks to himself: I thought there was only one speaking whose voice echoed.]</p>
        <p>George 1981: Yes, indeedie. You'll be glad there's not four of us.</p>
        <p>George 1980: [who is near Franklin's left, quips]: Three-fourth's is enough to handle.</p>
        <p>George 1981: Yes, if we find one more of us we get to take a journey into a cash register drawer or vending machine.</p>
        <p>George 1980: 4 of us can get mighty feisty. <br>
            <br>
            George 1981: Yeah, feisty. </p>
        <p>George 1980<br>
          to George 1981: Remember the time we met [George clinks George]</p>
        <p>George 1981: Yeah, I was falling into a child's pocket then George fell in and another, but the kid said, &quot;mommy, mommy, one more quarter please.&quot; And George fell in. It was cramped and we got into a fight jingling in the kid's pocket. I ended up sideways. Boy did that little youngin scream when my metal grooves nipped his bottom, just sat right on top of me, two inches away from his crack.</p>
        <p> [George 1980 snorts]</p>
        <p>George 1981: I don't even think the kid was wearing under pants [says George to another.] And I was newly minted, with very fresh grooves.</p>
        <p>Franklin 1975: What happened after that?</p>
        <p>George 1980: The kid exchanged us for a dollar.<br>
            <br>
            George 1981: That's how it happens. They can't handle us in parts.</p>
        <p> [Franklin eyeballs them cautiously.]</p>
        <p>George 1965: Well about now, the baskets are going to be sent around and we will all hop in and separate. Get lost among all the others. The shear weight of metal on top of metal can be nauseating. [He says confidingly]</p>
        <p> &hellip;. And I can't count on how many baskets I've been in, he continued. <br>
  It doesn't bother me though. I like to help facilitate a world of change.<br>
  <br>
  George 1965: What about you Franklin? Do you like to partake in this give and take of <br>
  distribution, which helps those in need?</p>
        <p>Franklin 1975: [gazing at George.] You know, I spend plenty of time in arcade machines being jostled between the fingers and dropped into the dark machine while being suffocated by other George's. No offense. And there was the time I fell on the ground and a kid found me. I was put into a piggy bank for a long time. Being kept in the gut of a porcelain pig has me spent. Besides, it's hard to comprehend any clear exchange. The darkness kept me weary, but being weighed down by other coins is nothing new.<br>
&hellip;And I'm only ten cents.</p>
        <p>George 1965: No, No, the needy love dimes. Just the other day I read give milk to a needy child for ten cents. You have value in other countries.</p>
        <p> [Hearing this causes Franklin to lean backward, clinking against George.]<br>
            <br>
            Franklin 1975: Sorry, the news of being of value in other countries gives me hope, but at the same I am wearied by this.</p>
        <p> I don't know&hellip;if I could do it.</p>
        <p>George 1965: What don't you know? [inquires George]</p>
        <p>Franklin 1975: I don't know if I could leave the security&hellip;</p>
        <p>George 1965: Security, [George interrupts] You didn't say you felt safe in the porcelain porcine. Or did you find security being jostled between fingers? I don't know what you mean by security, Franklin. I don't know what you mean. &hellip;Or the kind of mentality you have situated together between your flat sides.</p>
        <p> [Franklin looks at George, &quot;The mentality I have?&quot; but George continues.]</p>
        <p>George 1965: Because what are we really, Franklin?</p>
        <p> [Franklin stands perplexed at such a direct question. He feels under attack, but doesn&rsquo;t quite understand why. A concept forms in between his thin metal membranes. As before, he thinks he never contemplates himself at all, being stuck in a self-defeated state. But this question adds three- dimensional coating. The direct attack counteracts the concept of &quot;me.&quot;]</p>
        <p> [He looks at George standing right by him struggling to accept the &quot;we&quot; feeling reality is being pulled away from him.] </p>
        <p>Franklin 1975: We're money. [he says in a restrained tone.]</p>
        <p>George 1965: Yeah, but what does that mean?<br>
            <br>
            Franklin 1975: Well, [struggles Franklin] we sit in places for some time, and sometimes we move.</p>
        <p> [A flash of himself lying on the ground gleams inside his inner metal.]</p>
        <p> [George sees Franklin twitch, causing light to bounce off his surface. Inside he has the image that he is lying on pavement feeling the higher part of the rubber soles inch away from his face. Next moment he skids across the ground. Somehow he becomes lodged between a person's big toe. The inner particle, which contains the connecting memory, is black for next he sees his face being pushed against the wind. His eyes clench. He sees himself submerged under water.] <br>
            <br>
  [This is one of Franklin's earlier moments which was suppressed somewhere in a particle of metal. Franklin looks back at George and for the first time in his life he feels degraded. ]</p>
        <p>Franklin 1975: But is it really up to us where we go or what we do? [Franklin shot back]</p>
        <p>George 1965: Are you just a pawn Franklin? An inanimate object? [George says in a derogative tone.] Or are you brought to life by some power of reason? </p>
        <p>Franklin 1975: It's like I've been pulled into interactions, which seem to have no value. [replies Franklin still thinking of his flash back.]</p>
        <p> And most of the time I feel this pressure weighing me down [He continues.]</p>
        <p> So, even if there is a reason, I don't sense it.</p>
        <p>George 1965: [rolls his eyes] Don't base your existence on feelings. [continues George]<br>
            <br>
  Maybe one day you'll be buried into dirt and over time the water will wet the ground and you will be uncovered or someone will find you. But for that to happen you have to fall first. </p>
        <p> But, it looks like I have to go Franklin.</p>
        <p> [A hand gathers him and the other quarters and drops them in the basket] </p>
      <p> [Franklin stands still and feels himself flip backwards and fall. A child picks up the dime looking at its shine in his hand. He inches toward the coverall pocket, then the hand slowly moves the other way and he is placed in with the other coins.]</p></td>
