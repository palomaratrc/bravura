      <td height="293" valign="top" class="textcell">Tired is the word I'd use<br>
        to describe the face I see.<br>
        You look up as some people pass,<br>
        then look over at me
        <p>Your eyes are dull yet very blue<br>
          and lower as you frown.<br>
          I feel your spirit torn and broken<br>
          dead and upside down.</p>
        <p>Your hands are bound by fingers laced<br>
          and tremble as you think.<br>
          The table rocks unsteadily<br>
          that makes you spill your drink.</p>
        <p>The floor creaks and you turn your head<br>
          then smile at a face.<br>
          Standing, you receive a hug<br>
          and relish the embrace.</p>
        <p>Returning to the plastic chair,<br>
          you quickly clean your mess.<br>
          I notice that your face changes<br>
        to one of hopelessness.</p>
        <p>Your eyes light up as friends pass by<br>
          then lose their sparkle fast.<br>
          I see that there's a light inside<br>
          but only from the past.</p>
        <p>Your cuts are deep and hide inside<br>
          to make you not believe.<br>
          The clock ticks and tells you the time<br>
          you grab your bag to leave.</p>
        <p>You don't see the footprints you left<br>
          inside the whole world&rsquo;s chest.<br>
          My watchful gaze took in your mind<br>
          and learned from your distress.</p>
        <p>When you sat down you called to me<br>
          and helped me see within.<br>
          I saw your torn and tattered soul<br>
          even behind your grin.<br>
          <br>
