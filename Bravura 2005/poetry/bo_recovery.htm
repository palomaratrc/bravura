        And to this I am one feather, fluttering fast against the throw.<br>
        Though my resolve seems brittle, I feel it's nerve more than before,<br>
        If I surrender never, we'll toil together and endure.<br>
        I cannot count the pieces of all my broken guarantees,<br>
        To what cannot be mended, I pray that time can remedy.<br>
        To those I've introduced to fire produced in my own hell,<br>
        I will not disregard your scars and you of mine, as well.<br>
        Though my will may play the healer, it cannot carry me alone,<br>
        I will need the strength of others when I am lacking of my own.<br>
        The winds will change and drive the clouds to again reveal the sun,<br>
      So that one feather may find its place with those who've fought, and won.</td>
