        to the County Fair,<br>
        you get to ride in a yellow school bus<br>
        and enjoy a tour of the back lot<br>
        of the fair grounds,<br>
        where the carnival people live.<br>
        First, you'll pass <br>
        the Midway Badging trailer<br>
        where the workers get their IDs.<br>
        Then, there's the trailer where <br>
        the performers check in.<br>
        As you turn left at the corner <br>
        towards the employee entrance,<br>
        you'll pass rows and rows of RVs<br>
        lined up neatly against a chain link fence<br>
        like houses in a suburban tract.
        <p>A young girl playing <br>
          in her temporary yard<br>
          of artificial turf<br>
          under an awning<br>
          that pulls out from her home on wheels<br>
          makes me wonder<br>
          how she got mixed up<br>
          in this crazy life.<br>
          Maybe her Momma drives the Dooley<br>
          that pulls her house,<br>
          while her Daddy drives the rig<br>
          that pulls a ride like Winky the Whale<br>
          or The Vominator (for her sake,<br>
          I hope it's Winky the Whale).</p>
        <p>With their family business<br>
          all folded up, neatly inside<br>
          a giant shoe box,<br>
          they parade up the Interstate<br>
          following the Fried Twinkie Wagon<br>
          and the Spiral French Fryer <br>
          to their next temporary home<br>
          where everything seems the same<br>
          where for her, everything is the same.<br>
