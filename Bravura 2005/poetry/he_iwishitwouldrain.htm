        being eaten by ants, one piece at a time. <br>
        I look at myself in the mirror<br>
        and I have to look away. <br>
        He was here not long ago, <br>
        smoking a joint and humming along with Blind Melon. <br>
        That was back when I could hear the rain on the roof <br>
        and my moth would fly about the window at night. <br>
        I still smell him in this room<br>
        and Blind Melon won't stop singing in my head<br>
        and the moth is still being devoured. <br>
        People come by to sit and talk, <br>
        unaware that a life is being ripped apart <br>
        into tiny pieces<br>
      just a few feet away.</td>
