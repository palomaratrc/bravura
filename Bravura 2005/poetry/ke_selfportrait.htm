        I would be shown,<br>
        One body, several people inside me,<br>
        All very different, very complex.<br>
        There would be dark mysyerious colors,<br>
        Yet inside there would be much light<br>
        To show the brightness I feel in my Spirit.<br>
        And the painting would show me, <br>
        A woman, child, my body wrapped in yours.<br>
        My lips sucking you.<br>
        But your manhood has somehow been replaced.<br>
        I am sucking a needle, getting a fix <br>
        From your body.<br>
        I am addicted to you.<br>
        I am rebellious, yet I must submit to you.<br>
        I walk away, but always run back to you.<br>
        I crave you. Physically crave you.<br>
        When does the prey become the hunter?<br>
        The eyes tell the story.<br>
        As I suck the honey venom,<br>
      I may drink the very life force from you.</td>
