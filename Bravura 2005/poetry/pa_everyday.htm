      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell"><p> I'm miles away <br>
        From the world I used to live in <br>
        From where I used to stand <br>
        Where I am it looks like <br>
        Starry darkness <br>
        Shrouded veil of light </p>
        <p> I thought I'd never again see the sun shine bright <br>
        Inside my heart, I feel day turn into night <br>
        I'm beginning to believe, in my lost ways <br>
        A faith lost, with every passing day </p>
        <p> Looking forward once more <br>
        Finally to be <br>
        The trusting girl you stole away from me </p>
        <p> You are gone from my life <br>
        I pray that will stay the same <br>
        You took a step away <br>
        And never looked back <br>
        So now I'm doing the same </p>
        <p> I'm finding love, no shrouded heart <br>
        Believing in hope <br>
        The light took over the dark <br>
        Learning to trust <br>
        I hope I'll stay the same <br>
        That things will never change <br>
        So with these words that I write <br>
        I want you to know..... </p>
        <p> From this moment on <br>
        I will always be <br>
        Whoever I choose to be <br>
        No longer will I run and hide at a memory <br>
        Open heart and open mind <br>
        That's how I'll live <br>
        Everyday <br>
        Everyday of my life </p>
        <p> Trapped in darkness <br>
        I fought hard, I prayed to die <br>
        God must've heard my pleas <br>
        He rescued me from your insanity <br>
        Now I walk among the living souls <br>
        Spirits open to the wonders of the world <br>
        Beautiful and Free <br>
        I became a butterfly with majestic wings </p>
        <p> In this moment, on this day <br>
        I'll wipe forever the bitterness away<br>
        Smiling, laughing everyday <br>
        I hope those things will never change</p>
        <p> Your face it turns to dust <br>
        Ashes as black as the night <br>
        But your face will always be <br>
        Imprisoned forever in my memories <br>
        All the pain you caused <br>
        I won't ever forget <br>
        But I will walk away <br>
        Turn this hatred of your soul <br>
        Into a million beautiful days <br>
        Cause I can say <br>
        For the first time <br>
        Sine you left <br>
        I'm moving on <br>
        I won't ever look back </p>
        <p> I'll end this song now I suppose <br>
        Say thanks to you even though it hurts <br>
        I'm a fighter now <br>
        Stronger inside than I ever would have thought that I could ever be <br>
        So thank you <br>
        For helping me to become <br>
        The woman, the fighter <br>
        I was destined to be </p>
