        As any flower nature could ever compose.<br>
        I was a &quot;Jack,&quot; meat eating and hardy<br>
        Brought up the way to split knot and acorn.
        <p>Into the forest, where the trees grow <br>
          Tall, the feral animals roam and <br>
          A flickering dim candle is not bright<br>
          Enough to have a flower take upon a root</p>
        <p>But glow still, we shall and beware the calm<br>
          And the coolness of the hyena when one<br>
          Moves into the forest, for the lion knows<br>
          Of the hissing and the lying.</p>
        <p>Only the end knows, the quick slip<br>
          Of a tongue is not yet what make trees<br>
          Grow or water flow or of what<br>
          Makes the sun shine no matter what</p>
        <p>They show, it will never be what surely<br>
          Can be, of all that is meant to be.<br>
          From where my deer prance along <br>
          The way the river has laid way, and</p>
        <p>Of top the tallest trees<br>
          Where the branch's tangle<br>
          The leafs scatter from Earth,<br>
          To whistle of a breath of air.</p>
        <p>I would search the forest for the perfect flower<br>
          So I would know what it would mean<br>
          To have the taste of the sweet pollen<br>
          Be refreshed into every single breath I took.</p>
        <p>What becomes present is all, which is factual,<br>
          The last of the spring flowers were picked<br>
          Perhaps never to ever grow again,<br>
          All that is left is dimmed dreams and a red</p>
        <p>Empty vase. Returned to the forest, to chop<br>
          It all down, to leave a trail of stumps behind<br>
          Leaving everything untwined and finally saying<br>
      For once I can leave it all behind.</p></td>
