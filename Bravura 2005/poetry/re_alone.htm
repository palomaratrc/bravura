      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell">Out here all alone, nobody hears my cries of pain<br>
        A graveyard of bone is all I see, because the world<br>
        she's dead to me.<br>
        I push away the hurt, I look to the light,<br>
        but the light runs away in a terrified flight.<br>
        Surrounded by darkness I have to go<br>
        the shadows blind me, I feel so low<br>
        Anguish gropes for me from its depths<br>
        Constricting me, waiting for death
        <p>Trapped in this cage I created myself<br>
          No feelings left, only hate and despair<br>
          my memory of you makes me wretch at my hair<br>
          nothing left, no glimmer of hope is near<br>
          I deserve this hell for engulfing the fear<br>
          Its' cold fingers claw at my brain<br>
          consuming every cell I scream out in pain<br>
          then the laughter mocking, as I try in vain.</p>
        <p>Unwittingly she disowns me in sorrow<br>
          hurting even to breathe, making me more hollow<br>
          I feel no reason to live another day<br>
          lying to yourself in your damn hideaway<br>
          not willing to feel, not willing to hope<br>
          living detached, it was all a joke</p>
        <p>You gave me so much care, running away judging what's<br>
          fair, neglecting my heart<br>
          the grief was too much, I couldn't bear.<br>
          I saw no reason for this hole eating me up,<br>
          gnawing my soul<br>
          If you know the pain that you caused me, the nameless<br>
          faces a reflection of my burning disgrace</p>
        <p>All my dreams are shattered, all my hopes are dashed<br>
          my life is twisted and now you're enhanced<br>
          you deceived me you led me on<br>
          You stretched and tore until my being was gone, <br>
          dancing with my emotions<br>
          Who knew they were such powerful poisons</p>
        <p>What should I do to let you know my feelings, <br>
          show you I still care<br>
          I know you understand me, the nature is still there<br>
          What do I have to do to make you listen to your heart<br>
          I know it's still fair, don't leave me here alone and in despair.<br>
