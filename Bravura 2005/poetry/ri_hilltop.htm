      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell"><p>I went to watch a sunset<br>
        at a park<br>
        on a hill</p>
        <p>Not for any poetic reason<br>
        but just because I had never seen<br>
        one before and wanted to know what<br>
        everyone was talking about<br>
        I sat and watched to the West as the last half<br>
        of the sun disappeared into nothing.</p>
        <p>There were families there<br>
        playing frisbee and barbequing<br>
        Children sat in swings<br>
        twisted the chain around<br>
        to spin and make themselves dizzy.</p>
        <p>I looked to the South<br>
        At the bottom of the hill<br>
        say my old high school<br>
        I had been to this spot<br>
        many times before<br>
        never to watch a sunset<br>
        only to look upon the past<br>
        always at night, always alone.</p>
        <p>I turned to the East and was deaf in my ear<br>
        from the wind blowing to the South<br>
        I closed my eyes and listened<br>
        listened to the wind and twisting swings<br>
        I took a deep breath and wondered if this is what it&rsquo;s like<br>
        the moment before you die<br>
        Do you stop for that last minute<br>
        and take in all that you never did before?<br>
        Or are you so preoccupied with dying<br>
        that you just let it all end with out taking note<br>
        I thought on this and turned</p>
        <p> To the North to leave the hill<br>
        Fathers were disposing of evidence that<br>
        they were ever there<br>
        Mothers talked, making plans for tomorrow<br>
        Children staggered begged for five more minutes</p>
        <p>I turned to walk away and saw a couple<br>
        who were facing the West the whole time<br>
        and had never said a word to each other<br>
        as I left all I could think of was how dry my hands were</p>
