      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell"><p>Hands folded while waking,<br>
        bridged and identical<br>
        Through theoretical space and time<br>
        New, revised environment<br>
        The scenery, the wilderness, the framed portraits<br>
        Attempting to endure</p>
        <p>Familiar passage<br>
        Traversed, fierce, amended<br>
        Dearly departed, yet the mythology has been unearthed<br>
        A vacancy presented in the patriarchal hive<br>
        I returned<br>
        The causal cadence still a footnote<br>
        to my freedom<br>
        It was known at birth<br>
        But it came with conditions<br>
        Indebted to my makers, enlisted by my kind</p>
        <p>Exodus of me, and my things<br>
          Our things<br>
          Idle matriarch<br>
          Passive observer<br>
          The eternal subject and pronoun<br>
          cherished and reviled<br>
          Divided heritage, severed branches of the organic symbol of origin<br>
          Earnest labors painfully unsung<br>
          All revealed throughout our odyssey<br>
          Forever nomads evolve into a new breed<br>
          But the generation<br>
          still goes undefined</p>
        <p>The departure, not the escape<br>
          Bold, unforgivable, but classic dissent<br>
          Distanced the members, and the memories, of kin<br>
          Yet the life still travels<br>
          Remains visible<br>
          Like the long extinguished extraterrestrial<br>
          Still seen from space by the creatures that mapped it<br>
          Organized it, navigated by it<br>
          Though its historic existence had ended</p>
        <p>The future becomes foreseeable<br>
        Though it is infinitely controversial and confused<br>
        I own it now<br>
        Genealogy traced<br>
        to the point of prehistoric oblivion<br>
        Legacies of lone descendents who travel on<br>
        They carry with them this knowledge<br>
        Home is a cleverly authored fiction<br>
        An evolutionary state of mind</p>
