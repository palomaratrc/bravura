      <td height="177" width="596" valign="top" class="textcell"><p> For too long <br>
        I&rsquo;ve written you up and down, <br>
        poured oceans into rivers, half a life <br>
        distilled into little-ease, <br>
        ink tincturing a scent, a single brow <br>
        propriety would never let me touch - <br>
        even modulations of your mimicry, <br>
        for every day we circled round the Isles of Shoales <br>
        to tack for home, sheets harnessed to a setting sun, <br>
        for one small bottle, fragile message sealed within, <br>
        slipped between the pages of the sea, <br>
        coming years too late. <br>
        Too long <br>
        I&rsquo;ve written you up and down <br>
        this mounting stay of obituary, stringing <br>
        saturated strands of sentences, <br>
        curing in your absence <br>
        where the bight of Long Sands <br>
        cups the sea, an open wound of who we were; <br>
        a siblings&rsquo; syntax canting castles <br>
        in the sand, for every tender token sifted <br>
        from your hand to mine, <br>
        and washed away. <br>
        Too long <br>
        I&rsquo;ve written you up and down <br>
        where even gull and godwit etched <br>
        their own patois of you, the Kaddish <br>
        stitched across my tongue, <br>
        bound by strictures of the littoral, <br>
        combing darker tides of grief, every low tide <br>
        bleeding through the cracks, <br>
        each high tide choking me in words of you, <br>
        until heart, distended, turned to haggis. <br>
        But now, the words of loss have all been spent, <br>
        the spinnaker, lifts and fills, the younger, <br>
        finally an elder reaching <br>
        for a fuller lifetime. Your words, <br>
        God&rsquo;s, or mine, they have no up, <br>
        no down, no right - <br>
        not even wrong; instead, each can only drop behind, <br>
        brilliant colors on a breathing sea, markers <br>
        should I ever wish to return to you, <br>
        whether for just an hour, or for a day. </p>
