        They pump in icy air to remind you you're still alive.<br>
        The walls are sterile; they feed off time.<br>
        White ghosts haunt the halls, <br>
        cleaning waste and prodding skulls. <br>
        They watch you with vulture eyes. <br>
        Asking questions; telling lies.<br>
        They dig in your head with hollow words, <br>
        trying to gain your trust.<br>
        Oh, how absurd!<br>
        You're fed emotions with colored tablets, <br>
        designed to rid you of filthy habits.<br>
        If you exhibit a lack of control, <br>
        they'll give you restraint.<br>
        And this is perfectly legal in the eyes of the state. <br>
        They'll lock you in the soft cell; <br>
        the hardest place on earth.<br>
        To insulate with silence; <br>
        to isolate your mirth.<br>
        You may scream and shout out all your sins.<br>
        But no voices escape; <br>
      they stay within. </td>
