        where a song can enhance the situation<br>
        beyond anything you could ever expect
        <p>Where the flames flicker shadows across her shoulder<br>
          and you're not making eye contact<br>
          but you're both staring deep within each other</p>
        <p>And you can feel her cheek brush against yours<br>
          and it's all of a sudden the greatest feeling in the world<br>
          and there are no words<br>
          because it's love<br>
          and there are no words</p>
        <p>And I smile to myself because for once<br>
          I know happiness<br>
          and its right there in her living room<br>
          right next to her<br>
          hand in hand<br>
          interlocking souls</p>
        <p>And the moment can't get any better<br>
          but then we kiss<br>
          and I am proven wrong<br>
          and the rest of the evening is spent<br>
          thinking about how I don't want to leave<br>
          and how if I just stayed<br>
          and woke up in the same spot<br>
          in the same living room<br>
          with the same girl<br>
          I would not be able to stop smiling <br>
        for the rest of the week</p>
        <p>And even though I did leave<br>
          she is still here<br>
          and<br>
          I<br>
          am <br>
          still <br>
        smiling.</p>
