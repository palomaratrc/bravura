AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH KEVIN RIEDEL:<br>
“WE’RE ABOUT AS TALENTED AS DOG VOMIT”</b><br>
Olli Deleon<br>
WWW.SOLITARYDOG.COM<br>
MARCH  5TH, 2011</center><br><br>


<p>As promised, here’s the transcript of my interview with Kevin I promised you guys back in February. Since AS has a pretty busy schedule, it took a while for my emails to get answered and approved by AS’s agent, what with all the fangirls and boys they must have. Anyway, on with the interview! I recorded it and have the audio posted here, if you feel like listening while you read. Enjoy!</p><br>

<p>“Grüße, Herr Deleon! You know, this ain’t that bad of a town.“</p>
<p>Self-assured, German-fluent, and slightly drunk, Kevin J. Riedel, 27, (keyboardist, programmer, co-composer) greets Solitarydog.com at a Four Seasons near LAX, at 10 in the morning: A four-star hotel for a four-star guy.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, I was poking around your site—have you ever actually read some of the things that get posted about us?” he blurts, laughing. “Debates on how gay Morgan and Jayson are for each other, or the secret meanings behind the cover art of the album! It’s so ridiculous! And everyone’s so busy trying to classify us! My favorite is the guy who decided we were ‘new neo-gothic heavy industrial electronica trip-rock’ or some such shit. Hilarious. There’re so many faces to AS, and we never really agree amongst ourselves what we are. I’d say we’re “techno metal,” or something else that’s made up. Are we rock? Are we metal? Industrial? Electro-folk-rock? What the hell are we?!”</p>
<p>Laughing, Kevin launches into a critique of marriage, finances in America, and wedding planners’ obvious bad color choices.</p>
<p>“Wait, is that a wedding ring? You’re married? I’m sorry…how’d it happen? How’d she trick you into it?” Kevin asks sympathetically, leaning back to stare at the ceiling-fans. He gives a small half-smile, before continuing, “How do people get so committed that they’d do that? I mean, really, why? Is she really hot?” </p>
<p>This from the man who’s all but married to Eve Anderson (singer/producer of Jagged Green)!</p>
<p>“See, I doubt I’ll ever get married. Eve doesn’t want to get married. How cool is that? Because that’s the thing, once you marry, everything changes, you’re committed, yeah, but you’re like completely committed and chained. And what sane person wants to go and have a ‘traditional’ wedding these days? Everything’s always pastel, the music sucks—the decorations! It’s all white and purple and lavender and pastels. Even the cakes are like that, it’s a lavender conspiracy! You think Morgan and Jay are dumb enough to get themselves married? Not civil-unioned, full, ass-blown marriage? Hell no! And what would our finances become, if we got married? Where do we move to, and so on? Who gets which house? Who takes whose name? Too much difficulties in it, compared to the freedom of a dedicated bachelor.” </p>
<p>Money problems for a member of AS? Seriously? At this question, Kevin leans forward excitedly, his hands stabbing down at the tabletop, rattling his drinks.</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah. You wouldn’t think it, huh? Especially since we hit number three, but still. We’re not rich, any of us. Weird, maybe, but normal, for us, too. Well, understand, we got screwed by Alexander Cooper, our first manager, right? Explained that half our paychecks went to paying venues for damages or hotels or some other bullshit, but somehow he owned five cars, right? Plus, we were all just kind of naturally broke when we got famous in the first place, so that carried over too—the reason we never really noticed Cooper’s grafting, we never really understood just how much money we were worth, so a couple thousand missing wasn’t really noticeable. We were just happy to have just the thousand! And Eve’s producer for JG, so money’s tight for her too. I’m not sure about finances for Jeff—He answered our ad on the Net, though, so I’m guessing he’s pretty tight too. Jay would know, I’m not that close to [Jeff], he’s more friends with Colin or Jay, to be honest.  Like, we all hang, sure, but he’s really hit it off with Jay and Colin, since none of them really talk a lot, you know?”</p>
<p>He is eager to talk now and goes on their plans for the weeks and months ahead, as they prepare to tour and promote an upcoming live album.</p>
<p>“Right now, Jeff and Colin are flying from Moscow to New York, they were asked to contribute on a Snel Doden album with Schultz and others. Morgan and Jay are in Berlin—or maybe Bonn?—doing promotional work with Hellner. He is helping us with the singles and videos—“Metal Noodles,” “Spiked Ramen,” “Dog Naked,” and “Digit Kill” are the obvious choices, and he’s helping us with advice on how the industry works (since usually you’re supposed to tour before an album comes out?), how the fans will probably react, all really good advice, apparently, from what Jay’s emails have said. Morgan’s emails are worthless—actually, wait; I have it in my pocket! It was so weird, I had to print it out to show to Skinner [AS’s manager]. Here.</p><br>

<p><i>“Stabbed a fish with my fingers bleeding south of Eden! Need to drop yourr trust if you awnt to see more sunlight”  heinrich not odd nomore weerd but heroin + slu++dominatrix lady = normal now so I guess heinrixh= normal too?”</i></p><br>

<p>“Yeah. Fucking weird-ass Morgan. This is basically every email he sends me, ever. The sad thing is, I’m so used to this kind of shit, that it’s like—we opened for Nevergarden one time, and once you’ve watched a forty-year old man shoot up while a dominatrix in red leather whips him—you find a lot of things unbelievably mundane. But anyway, once they’re done with Hellner, Jay and Morgan will meet the rest of us in New York on Thursday. There’s a man, Roy Bannit-Bonnet-Something, who’s apparently the name in stage shows. Name ‘em, he’s done them. KISS, Prince, NIN, Nevergarden, Shingani Soft, he’s covered their stage shows, so Jay’s determined—okay, decided—to get him, and we’ve seen his work, it’s real good. Anyway, so we’re searching and talking a lot, lately, looking for the perfect stage, with Roy’s help, hopefully.  The biggest concern is to keep ourselves occupied with new ideas, keep coming up with our own brand. I mean, Bowie and Kiss started it, but everyone’s kept it up, you know? Like, you can’t just have a straight rock show anymore, and even low-energy genres like electronica, techno, they’re starting to find that as well. So to help the songs, to make the show a show instead of a fucking music recital, you need that bit of theatre.”</p>
<p>That requisite amount of theatre appears to be the cause for the surprising addition of S. Colin Whitman to AS’s lineup in November, although a large amount of alcohol was heavily involved, as many fans have openly wondered.</p>
<p>“Well, once we realized how popular Noodles was, we looked around and said, we don’t need to play bars and clubs anymore, we can actually sell out stadiums! And once we figured that out, it became obvious that the stages would be too large for us—really, Morgan—to effectively play and run around doing shit at the same time. So, we put out the word that we were looking for a backup guitarist to play Morgan’s parts, right? And we’re cruising the Southwest, and in Tucson Morgan and me and Jeff decided to go to this bar. Well, Morgan’s kind of a slutty drunk, see, and he was wearing his makeup, and he started talking with this tall, scrawny kid, sitting at the bar alone about three stools down from us. So, eventually everyone gets hammered and he agrees to come with us and hang out, right? And we’re all fucking drunk, we of course decide the kid knows Morgan’s going to start humping as soon as we get outside, we figured he knew Morgan was a guy. Yeah, we were that drunk. And he does start humping Colin in the parking lot, and the kid laughs and for whatever reason gets into the car with us and comes back to the Motel, and goes with Morgan up to his room—where Jay is sleeping. I told you, he’s a slutty-drunk. Anyway, Morgan’s guitar’s on the bed, and Colin asks to play a few chords, Morgan agrees, Colin rips out a riff from Shingani’s “Practical” and Morgan comes running into our room—and that’s pretty much how Colin was discovered. And now that we have an extra guitarist, we can have some really new inclusions in the live shows.”</p>
<p>Kevin’s ideas on what the show might contain include large phallic symbols arranged like Stonehenge, gouts of flames amongst religious icons and symbolism, and animé-style videos on stage-sized screens to accompany most songs (à la the Gorillaz or the Boonies).</p>
<p>“I mean, we’ve screwed ourselves up a little bit before, so we’re trying to keep the shows as exciting, just a little safer. Like, not many fans were ever aware of this, but Morgan once nearly slashed his femoral artery during a set. Oh yeah, the medics said he’d been about eight millimeters from dead. Well, he had this kind of spiky bracelet on, and we closed with “Matchstick,” and Morgan was slapping his thigh and then started to pound on his knee in time to the beat, see? And he missed, and the bracelet fucked him up a couple inches above his knee, on the inside of his right thigh. So, he’s standing onstage for a full ninety seconds, finishes the song and the lights go down, he strides off and tells the first groupie he sees “I think I cut myself,” sticks out his leg, blood everywhere. I mean, he got bandaged and everything, but it was weird, you know? Fans in the front row just thought it was part of the act, some Alice Cooper shit or something, so nobody really reacted.”</p>
<p>Just one of the many on-stage escapades, Kevin explains, and the lessons AS has learnt from such mishaps have proven invaluable to them.</p>
<p>“The problem is safety, like I said, it doesn’t matter if we’re a little charred or such, but as soon as a fan feels uncomfortable we’re fucked, especially since we use a moderate amount of pyrotechnics, so we need to keep it cool, figuratively speaking of course. And of course we’ve always incorporated our random ideas into our live shows, somehow (like using a chicken carcass as a flail during “Headroom”), but until Metal Noodles, we never had the major finances needed to do it, well, better. That, plus Cooper’s grafting. I mean, now we can have giant flames five, six meters long, instead of setting our mike stands on fire, for example, like we used to. So, with a good stage show, we should be able to do even better, and maybe even get SD some more airplay too—it deserves it!”</p>
<p>That raises a host of questions of course. What reasons would account for the massive surge of play for their sophomore release when Solitary Dog was arguably just as good?</p>
<p>“Interesting you say that, actually. See, since we got picked by GA records, we had availability in foreign markets—since it was an offshoot of Metropolis Records, originally, already had its useful contacts?— especially since we had Skye [Dominguez] giving us lots of support. So, when Dog was in Germany, France, England, Russia, Brazil, Japan—the big buyers, basically—it went platinum in Europe, South America, Asia, a month after the American release. The trouble was that in America Solitary Dog was released the same week as Shingani Soft’s Serum, so, obviously, we were marketed by retailers as the “fresh-faced kids who sound pretty okay.” I mean, not exactly like that, but that’s roughly how the industry works. Plus, Shingani was incredible on Serum, and it kinda just pushed us aside for the time being, since they were already so strongly established. But Metal Noodles was released in a period of high sales, but none of the releases were in our genre, at least not enough to interfere with. Mostly pop and R&B that quarter, see, nobody to compete with? Didn’t matter anyway, did it? Noodles was definitely better than Dog, if in just overall strength. It was an album of sixteen singles, really, just powerful and more overwhelming than Dog was. ‘Dog good, Noodles gooder!’ For a while it’s been kind of a running joke with us that Europe and Japan seem to appreciate American music more than Americans do! We honestly expected Metal Noodles to follow the same pattern, make us gods overseas and nobodies over here, but…yeah. I’ll say this, the Japanese and Finnish fans are the best, know the lyrics and songs perfectly. At all three concerts in Japan, there would always be, somewhere, a small cadre of school-girls, like eleven, twelve years old, rocking out harder than the teens! And one of the girls who always managed to get backstage looked just like Eve, and see, she knew it too, so that was kind of creepy. She didn’t hit on me or anything really serious, just kinda gushed and had me autograph her breasts but it was strange with her hanging out backstage, I kept thinking Eve was always just out of the corner of my eye!”</p>
<p>Between having not seen his girlfriend during AS’s five months of world tour and giving interviews in support of Metal Noodles, scrambling to fix their ex-manager corruptions (he’s since been replaced with Harold Skinner), and holing himself up in a studio on the outskirts of Philadelphia (Grievous Angel Records’ hometown), Kevin seems remarkably nonchalant. Something he knows the fans don’t?</p>
<p>“Of course I’m not worried! It’s mostly a product of having spent so much time with Morgan, understand? I mean, in two days he got us banned from three amusement parks (Disneyworld, Busch Gardens, and SeaWorld) and he just doesn’t care! He’s the most carefree person in the world, and just expects the world to fall into place for him. He’s so goddamn confident of himself that we honestly don’t matter much in whether or not Anarchy Sun succeeds—it succeeds on Morgan’s passion, and we—Jay, Günther, me—we’re just helping it along, get it? If you go through Solitary Dog, listen to the lyrics and the main melodies, it’s entirely Morgan. He’d walk into the studio and just start humming and say ‘That’s what this song should sound like.’ That’s exactly how ‘Sweet Saint Michael’s Memory’ and ‘Spindle’ were born; Morgan just decided he wanted songs with those bass-lines. He wrote the lyrics, and we agreed they worked. And most of the time, we agreed, it worked with the lyrics, with his voice. It wasn’t so much a dictatorship as just following all of his concepts. And judging from our popularity, it was a good plan, right?</p>
<p>Kevin chuckles and sips from a small water bottle and leans back in his chair, and explains the reason for Anarchy Sun’s success.</p>
<p>“See, people don’t get it, they think Morgan and us got famous just through sheer talent and luck. I mean, we did, but not as though it was just random luck. Let me tell you a story, drive home the point. There was this guy, Pryor Jennerson, real famous Brit singer for Lateral Lust, about four, five years back. The guy’s half-crazy, and absolutely revered in Japan and Korea and Singapore and Thailand, treated like a god there. Had his own name brand anything, understand? Shoes, candy bars, guitars, everything that could be made into merch, was. Simple as that. So what happens? He makes two records, they go platinum in East Asia, he makes it big and gets lazy, or disinterested, I don’t know. He got bored, stopped thinking, stopped taking the next step in his evolution, keeps putting out the same thing, no changes, nothing new, just the same old shit. Sales, airplay, concert attendance, downloads, they all go down, people move on. What’s he doing now? Yogurt endorsements for some Korean dairy company and software ads for a firm in Japan. How did he get there? Didn’t care about where he wanted to be. Didn’t have enough want. Just figured he’d lucked out and that his luck would hold.</p>
<p>“Morgan took control of his life, and he does it so completely you can’t see it. He never hopes things to turn out right, he only finds they turn out to his advantage, see the difference? He expects the world to fall into place for him so absolutely and so perfectly that he creates his own karma-sphere. He just happens to meet Skye Dominguez [singer for Tanzkampf] in some random Rezztown bar on the outskirts of Atlanta, of all places, just happens to hit it off and hands him our demo tracks, and we’re picked up by Grievous Angels Records three weeks later? And Colin! Morgan decides to hit on a cute guy in fucking Arizona who just turns out to be as good as Jay or Morgan? No, too easy. Morgan made us, made and got us here, blind luck, determination, karma, whatever the hell, Morgan’s the source of it. We’d still be playing clubs and bars in Oakland if Morgan weren’t so goddamned determined.”</p>
<p>So Anarchy Sun is at a good point in their career. Any final words for Solitarydog.com before heading out to N.Y.?</p>
<p>“You need to learn to listen to all that inspirational shit that they tell you in school, and just condense it. If you want something, if you want to be or go or do, just go for it, just put all of your effort and thought into being yourself and achieving yourself. ‘God is dead and the world is up for grabs!’ so…Be yourself. Be feared. Be fearless.” </p><br><br>
