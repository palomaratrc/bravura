<center><b>Believe It or Not</b><br>
By Rochelle Miller</center><br><br>

<p>This is a true story.  A few years ago, on a late afternoon, I was sitting alone in my rented, London apartment, reading Donna Tartt’s The Secret History. I was trying to mentally block out the sound of the crazy lady who lived in the apartment above my own.  She stomped up and down on her floor and screamed endlessly in Croatian. At one point I thought the ceiling would cave in under the full force of her rage.  I looked up from my book and watched through the window as outside it rained Lego and jigsaw-pieces into the front garden.  Social services had taken the lady’s six-year old son away some days before brandishing her “unfit” to take care of him.</p>
<p>One wet morning before work I made the unfortunate mistake of making eye contact with the crazy lady.  It was just as I was rushing out of the front door we shared on my way to work, that our paths literally crossed.  She was dressed in heavy black lace and on her head she wore a black turban.  Her frightening, boney features were pale and looked almost green set against the light in the shaded, leafy front garden.  It struck me how she bore a strong resemblance to the apparition in Susan Hill’s The Woman in Black, a play I had once seen some years before.  The crazy lady punished me for staring at her by yelling and spitting and following me all the way to the crowded bus stop in the next street.  In a thick eastern European accent, with all the venom she could muster, the crazy lady repeatedly screamed at me “LIAR!”  In a fashion which only the British can pull off, everybody at the bus stop behaved as if nothing out of the ordinary was happening, they continued to read their papers and chat on their cell phones. The poor crazy lady eventually left, frustrated at not being able to get anyone’s attention.  When she’d gone a man turned to me and enquired “Do you know when the next number 10 bus is due?”  The summer I moved to London was the loneliest time of my life. </p>
<p>This a true story, except perhaps some of the finer details would not stand up to severe interrogation.  I’m in doubt as to whether the crazy lady was specifically Croatian.  I’m not completely sure the crazy lady followed me to the bus stop that morning and actually I can’t say for certain that the crazy lady ever really existed at all.  When I’m reminded though of that very first summer I spent in London the image that always comes to mind is of the crazy lady at the bus stop. </p>
<p>A friend of mine who has made a career “from knowing the facts” is intensely frustrated by this story.  I do concede her point but the most honest answer I can offer her or anyone else as to the truth about whether or not the crazy lady exists is to say this; </p>
<p>“She does, but I haven’t seen her for quite some time.” </p>
