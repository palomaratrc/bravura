<center><b>Blame it on the Weather</b><br>
By Bryce Spadger</center><br><br>

<p>Each night for two years I had slept in the cold barracks of a boarding school in Missouri. The still air moved at a crawling pace, easing through the old wooden walls of the cabin. I would lie in complete uniform, but for the tired pair of shoes I brought from home sitting at the foot of my bed. It was necessary in combating the frigid climate throughout the night. Never was the nightly cold spell enough to cause hypothermia, just enough to keep you waking up ill every morning. Illness never proved enough to cause any health problems, one that might summon a doctor to my remote location, but enough to make the seldom moments of free thought dedicated to finding the day’s remedy. </p>
<p>The schooling commenced just after dawn every morning. Just after a gathered prayer under the gray skies above. Each of us would sit at our respective desk, walls built on each side to ensure isolation and charter our way towards a general education diploma. Each assignment and every test left my desk completed and always came back with little or no corrections made. For a companion of mine, a C every once in a while was the best he could hope for. More often, he repeated the material three or four times before he reached a passing grade. To my recollection he wasn’t the slowest one in the class as far as I could tell, but I believe he never put much stake in the accumulation of knowledge.</p>
<p>I first met him standing before the golden Mercedes he’d arrived in. I reveled in its fashionable glint and sleek exterior feeling the deteriorated backdrop intensified in its presence. Hearing the engine drone, I noticed the open gate at the entrance in the foreground, but quickly turned my attention to the kid standing alone. An urge compelled me to stick around, to relive familiar sentiments. Sparing my own introduction, I began inquiring him about his identity. Nately, he introduced himself as, answering me with hapless statements that vaguely illustrated a clear picture. All I could go by was the identical attire of the stranger and his neat black shoes planted determinedly to the hard ground. Letting the uninspired questionnaire fade I watched him study the scenery. Head swiveling in exploration of the foreign land, encircling the few buildings he would call school, church and home. He strained his neck to catch distant features along the horizon that might have seemed intriguing out the corner of his eye, but when examined only detailed our desolation. </p>
<p>I asked then who the woman was that had dropped him off. He spoke her name, awaiting my recognition and finished after several silent seconds adding her title as his mother. She had followed Brother Clancy, the head of the staff to his office for paperwork, was my assumption. I asked how he felt about the school thus far. He reacted as if he hadn’t noticed the compound ready to devour him whole. </p>
<p>As he studied its simplicity a woman of multifarious glamour appeared from around the corner. She had soft white fur emerging from the cuffs and neck of a tan leather jacket. Auburn hair carelessly fluttered along with her rapid steps. Her demeanor gave the weather more credit than it deserved. Her face, in all of her befitted scramble was inescapably amiable. It was a brand of benevolence that coaxed you into sympathetic submission. About her shoulder her trusty purse also fur-lined held a well matched Chihuahua with leather collar from which dangled a lone silver amulet. It might be added that the Chihuahua’s beige fur melted into the complexion of the fur along the purse; made me wonder who’d come first.</p>
<p>Clancy stood in the background pathetically groveling to the heedless debutant. “Miss Mazuma,” he sounded triumphantly behind her. “I can assure you that I’ll take care of young Nately here,” he paused for dramatic effect and to make sure he was talking to Nately and not me. “As if he was my own,” and with his announcement he seized the title of guardian from Nately’s mother. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the woman twiddled along, seemingly ignoring his declaration she headed for a brief farewell. She went in for a hug, but stopped amidst all the eagerly awaiting eyes and darted to the idling car. Lunging in, I heard the dog squeal in the clatter of its crashing vessel. She returned holding only a disposable camera in the hand adorned with a golden wristwatch. Behind her the tiny mammal perched itself on the front dash, panting. Clancy hurried to take the obsolescent camera and zealously strummed the cogwheel emitting the mechanical clicks till it would no longer spin. Without the typical attention calling of any amateur photographer he snapped the hastily organized picture. Thinking back I can see the still life in my memory; Nately’s expressionless stare, mother alongside, dazzling us onlookers with a well-rehearsed angle of her superficial surface. I knew then only Clancy, the Chihuahua and I would keep that scene lasting. The unexposed image would be left to vicariously undergo a camera's only other function, to be disposable. She had performed eloquently for the shot, but the subsequent act turned me cross. She turned to a new grief stricken Nately, the one the camera didn’t capture. Hugging him she mentioned how she’d never forget him; that he still meant the world to her and reiterated the hopelessness by saying she would be in touch as soon as she could. Nately stood silent in her shallow pool of contrived gloom. It was as she pranced back to the vehicle returning to life, that his eyes began to glisten with emotion.</p>
<p>When the entire scene was played out I was elected to be Nately’s confidant. The one with whom he could only speak. I assured him the others weren’t worth conversing with anyway. I told him newcomers would have to stand at the wall for most hours of the waking day, forgetting to mention it was only for the standard three month introductory period. Watched the days go by, and counting up to eight months he was never permitted to sit amongst the sea of navy blue uniforms while receiving our sermons. I witnessed his presence begin to blend into the wallpaper. I felt oddly compelled to stand up for his release, but would be punished with push-ups or prayer or sometimes both. When I’d return and always drearily look to Nately I never noticed the signs of torment I’d been reflecting. In fact, he seemed numbed to the aging of his soul, praying before the lifeless edifice. Each degree colder reproval became, whatever anguish I thought I’d seen, seemed to diminish in him. </p>
<p>At night before lights out I would tell him stories from my hometown. Try and get a laugh at the embarrassing antics I could still fondly remember. It felt like I was talking to the wall itself, or worse yet a mirror. It was in the mirror I’d seen my blue eyes turn to gray. So I avoided the mirror now, but I couldn’t avoid the melancholy stare of my companion. Nately listened politely. Apathetically he would wait for my conclusion, shake his head in disbelief, kick his shoes off and lay down to rest. </p>
<p>One night, an hour into the darkness of the barracks, I commanded him follow me. To the kitchen he followed, never asked a question, simply stood at the point where I’d left him. I could barely tell if he were awake or not when I came back holding a ketchup size bottle of peppermint extract. </p>
<p>“The other kids would die to have a drink of this, buddy.” I said, holding the label up to his face, aimed at his well-trained stare. “Let’s just say, it oughta warm us up.” It was a nefarious understatement that I hoped would get his attention. “See that alcohol-level, buddy?” He’d never seen one before.</p>
<p>He was still and I led him out to the frozen lake resting in pathetic defeat by the cold hands of winter. It was located within shouting distance of the overseer’s chambers. I twisted the cap off from the bottle, saluted the gray sky, closed my nostrils and courageously guzzled. I shuttered violently and struggled to keep myself from plummeting to the ground. I gagged slightly in my stupor but suppressed the potion’s escape. In a daze I felt the turmoil in my stomach increase. The sinewy extract felt like mercury in my gut. I confidently handed Nately the bottle. He looked it over skeptically, a bit apprehensively, but broke from hesitation with solemn cheers to the lake and let the serum enter. His somber angst became a riotous cough as he too fought the inner battle against its audacity. It looked as though for the first time Nately lost his balance standing, it was amusing seeing him fall. Quickly, he settled himself on the cold earth.</p>
<p>I turned away from his distress and gazed out over the lake. I became overcome with visions of spring in this forsaken wasteland. The lake offering itself to the algae that grew with its permanent stillness, but now thinly iced over and completely inhabitable. I poured a drop on it, just to see a bit of steam rise from frozen surface. I wondered if by now Nately had passed out cold. He sat staring above the horizon into the gray ceiling above, motionless and tattered like an ancient scroll. Looking back down at him I noticed his two feet pointed skyward, shoeless. Feet sprinkled with dirt and red at the heel and at the ball of his foot. I squinted in disbelief then erupted in laughter. </p>
<p>A sound came from the nearby cabin. I held my laughter and kneeled down, smiling in the face of consequence. Nately didn’t react; he only stared off into the darkness, a familiar gloss coated on his forlorn stare.</p>
<p>“Don’t say much do you?” I asked in a whisper.</p>
<p>He shrugged, silencing me as he’d been so apt to do since I’d first met him. Talking was a bad habit here and I secretly despised Nately for his complacency.</p>
<p>“I wish I knew the truth about you,” I confessed, “why everyone treats so fucked up.” I said, slurring my speech at the end. Inside I reprimanded myself for speaking at all. I looked and saw him still staring out over the lake. </p>
<p>I took another drink. My insides burned with bitterness. Vision became blurred. I needed to get back, I thought to myself. “Meet back here tomorrow night?” I said as if he had been right behind me in my retreat.</p>
<p>He had been shivering, but didn’t attempt to move a muscle, just kept his eyes on the lake. “Sure,” I heard from a distance. I began to the barracks stumbling, feeling unable to make it back I began hurrying more intensely into the darkness. “I’ll be waiting,” he called out to me from the ground. </p>
