<center><b>Fey</b><br>
By Clayton Beach</center><br><br>

<p>She was my Fey.  Fey as is otherworldly, a whimsical, magical creature.  Her beauty was so delicate, so strange and so bewildering to my senses that she seemed closer in blood to the mermaid or the dragon than the average human female.  Surely, she was more than simian, either part of some lost race of gods, or perhaps the muse felt it was time to walk the earth as flesh and bone.  The crystalline balance that permeates the great symphonies of Mozart and the timeless spirituality of the ragas of north India found their expression in the double helix, melting together into delicate chains of protein, swirling into eddies of electrons so fully in harmony that She emerged; music in the flesh.  </p>
<p>With such a balance of features, with such delicacy, she made me believe in love again.  In that sense, she was my Fe, because she renewed my faith.  She made me believe again; believe in love, believe in humankind.  Before I met her, I had forsaken my role as a living man.  Sick of the distractions and the delusions of sex and lust, I had chosen thought, introspection and a cloistered world of self expression, renouncing the flesh, renouncing the slavery to my own reproductive system.  Then, all of a sudden, I found a woman so remarkable, so wonderful that I was compelled to leave the comfort of my hermitage.  Suddenly, the ancient passions stirred in my loins and the animal within me awoke.  But unlike some women, who stir the loins into violence and greed, who awaken the primitive hunger, her very presence dissolved all anxiety and filled me with an opiate sense of satisfaction.  I did not lust for her, I yearned for her with my body and soul.  Holding her in my arms put me at peace with the world.    </p>
<p>But alas, she did not find so much meaning in me.  She did not find in me a man to stir her fires, a man to awaken the passionate woman that dwelt within her soul.  Perhaps she thought I was insane, perhaps she was intimidated by my fiery passion, or perhaps she simply found me to be a melodramatic bore.  Whatever the cause, she simply walked away.  Now, there is a part of her, a little image, a little memory, which I am cursed to bear.  There are terrible disadvantages to having a photographic memory.  There are terrible disadvantages to being able to recreate every moment of our brief affair in perfect detail.  It is terribly painful, and yet so terribly easy, so terribly tempting to resurrect the single, gentle flick of her tongue, that golden moment of our only kiss.  What easy poison it is to meticulously recreate her smile and the way it made her eyes shimmer, to recreate the porcelain wings of her shoulder blades and stroke my fingers down her spine, to once again massage her jaw, to once more run my thumb against her fluttering eyelids, so pale and delicate, striped with little blue veins.  It is such bittersweet torture to once again brush her long black lashes with my finger, and to curse myself for not kissing them when I had the chance.    </p>
<p>There is a Acacia tree that I walk past everyday during my morning constitutional.  It is a stately, beautiful tree, a perfect specimen really.  Its tiny leaflets are powdery white, the buds of the flowers are beginning to bloom bright yellow.  Its wispy, black branches snake out amongst the glittering gold and silver foliage.  Ironic that her namesake has the same delicate features, the same magic sense of otherworldliness.  It seems incongruous, this delicate old world tree amongst the thick and heavy new world oaks, much like she stood out from her sturdy and plain American rivals, a sprightly dryad amongst the stolid, stodgy ents.  Perhaps I would not have noticed this beautiful, wonderful little tree did it not share its name with my sweet Fey, my sweet Fe.  But since I cannot have her, I walk past it every day.  I sit for a moment in the shade, atop a little boulder of granite that juts up amongst the greenery, marking the entrance to a dry creek bed and a little path beneath the towering oaks.  I sit there in the shade and glance for a moment at the rare beauty, relive a memory or two, and then I get up and continue my walk.  </p>
<p>When I was a child I created an impossibly beautiful creature with my own imagination.  I pretended to sleep in on the weekends, and would daydream about her.  When I got older and started dating, I always had her in the back of my mind.  I would size my partners up compared to that canon, that ideal.  It was a terrible thing to do, unfair for both myself and my lovers, but as I have always been prone to fancy, and I was always aware that my expectations were impossibly high.  This fantasy simply gave me a rubric against which to judge potential mates.   Alas, pitiful me, little did I know that my ideal did indeed exist.  My Fey, my Fe, she ended all of this.  Now I have seen the ideal in the flesh.  Now I know that my love exists, and so long as I can conjure her image in the back of my mind, so long as I can still taste her sweet lips, no woman will satisfy me.  </p>
<p>At least I have my art.  At least I can sit here and create.  If I cannot have Art embodied in human flesh, at least I can have her in an abstract form.  In some ways, she’s helped me.  I’ll be able to retreat back into that hermitage of artistic asceticism and create.  Now, no woman will distract me from the loneliness of creation.  At the same time, I have tasted of bliss.  I have known, if only for an evening, the joy of true companionship.  For once, I was with a woman who spurred my creative drives rather than spurning them.  For once, I held my muse.  I guess I should be thankful that I had that chance.  I guess I should be thankful for my meticulous little memories.  I guess I should rejoice that I have such memories to indulge in.  But God, I long for so much more!</p>
