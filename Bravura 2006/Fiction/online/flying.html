<center><b>Flying</b><br>
By Karen Wooton</center><br><br>

<p>It begins by really believing. I always believed I could fly, I mean really fly.  People around me didn’t fly but I believed I could. I  After all, I fly in my dreams.  I used to fly more when I was younger but on a good night I still get to fly.  It is seldom that lofty high altitude stuff.  It is usually low-level, tree-top skimming flight where I am riding in ground effect.  But it is flying.</p>
<p>Superman flew.  He’d run towards the camera, step, jump, there’d be a flap of cape, and then you would see him flying with arms stretched out in front of him.   I thought that George Reeves was always a little embarrassed running around in that form-fitting suit, slightly paunchy.  Even though the suit was black and white, I always saw blue, red and yellow just like the comic Superman.  </p>
<p>Steve Reeves…no wait…  Steve Reeves could knock over pillars and single handedly battle Roman legions but he couldn’t  fly.  Christopher Reeves… no, I think it was Christopher Reeve…,  he could fly. He had a jazzy comic book colored suit and a more chiseled face and form. I don’t remember that he had to run before jumping into the air.  He could fly with Lois—or maybe it was that Lois could fly with him.  It was like they were in a negative gravity field and as long as they were touching, Lois could fly.  Maybe if he could touch me I could fly too.  No…It’s too late now.  He couldn’t fly anymore after he fell off that horse and, of course, he’s gone now.  </p>
<p>I was sure that Douglas Adams was on to something.  He said all you have to do is throw yourself at the ground and miss.  Arthur Dent did it.  It sounds like a sensible enough method.  I tried. I learned immediately that not missing over cement  was very painful.  I tried throwing myself at grass, and when I failed to miss it didn’t hurt as much but left hard-to-remove grass stains on my jeans.  Eventually I accepted that I would have to find a different way.</p>
<p>There was this great book where a psychic girl could slip into the mind of animals.  That sounded like the ticket.  Slide my consciousness into the mind of a passing crow.  Just concentrate and I would be able to see through the crow’s eyes and feel my wings pull through the wind again and again, climbing into the sky then turn downwind and glide effortlessly, watching the ground for small scurrying creatures or a hapless possum unsuccessful at crossing the road.  Not sure about having to deal with that feeding stuff and while I tried again and again with all my might I never managed to slide my consciousness into a bird’s.</p>
<p>I have seen these crazy people who tie bungees to their ankles and jump off bridges.  That’s not flying, that’s falling with a big bounce.  I’d feel like one of those stupid kid toys –the paddle with the ball on elastic.  I played with those.  I know what happens when the elastic breaks. Not for me.</p>
<p>I learned to fly planes.  That would be obvious when you know you have to fly.  Planes make noise when they fly.  The drone in your ear is constant, louder when you use full power to climb above the world; quieter in the glides, descending as you invariably must.  Cessation of that drone is something you do not want until you have landed and parked the plane.  Sudden loss of that noise can terrify the heart and add plenty of challenge to the moment. All that noise and the potential for fear, that’s not flying flying.  </p>
<p>I also tried hang gliders.  No noise.  You find a cliff  edge that faces into the wind.  You drag this contraption up the hill  to the edge, then strap yourself  in so you can hang under the wing, then run to the edge and run off.  There is certainly a rush when the wings rest on the breeze and you glide.  It’s quiet and you can float on the currents but that inevitable direction is still down.  It’s an improvement over the noise but its still only sort -of flying.  </p>
<p>I want the real thing.  I want unencumbered climbing, soaring, gliding.  I want to climb up and play in the clouds or face into the wind and hang motionless with the world spread out below me.  I want to swoop and roll, soar to the heights and dive towards earth just skimming the ground.  I want to be free to decide what direction to go; to challenge the wind, or turn and ride its currents.  That’s flying, that’s the real thing and  I believe I can fly.   I believe I can really fly….. </p>
<p>What I have learned to accept is that …well… it’s just …not today.</p>
