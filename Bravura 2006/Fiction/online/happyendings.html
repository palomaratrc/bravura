<center><b>Happy Endings</b><br>
By Mike Eastman</center><br><br>

<p><center>I.</center></p>
<p>Someone once said, “Love is a promise already broken.”  Don’t know what the fuck that means exactly, but I like it anyhow.  Love had me under her heel, like a wad of over-chewed gum waiting to be scraped off.  Actually, I had been scraped off.  So there I lay, scrapped off.  Scrapped off the stiletto of love, sinking into the gutter of my couch.  Alone.   </p>
<p>The ceiling fan blades dragged slowly through the air, as if too depressed to move on its own volition.  The walls sweated in the thick summer air.  Shit.  That’s all my life was, shit.  It covered the floor.  Leave it to my mom to go suicidal when her army of strays were pregnant.  So there I was, laying on the couch, my mom in a mental ward, and cat shit covering the floor.   </p>
<p>My glazed pupils fell upon the T.V.  It was around 1:50 p.m. so all the movies and shows on were wrapping up.  Happy endings.  Couples embracing in the sunset.  Fade to black.  Evil villain falling off a rooftop.  Fade to black.  The underdogs win the pennant.  Fade to black.  Happy endings.  </p>
<p>To pass the intermission between shows, I decided to occupy my mind with a game of “Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.”  “Wag the Dog” was on.  Woody Harrelson was in “Kingpin” with Bill Murray.  Bill Murray was in “Caddyshack” with Chevy Chase.  Chevy Chase was in “Hero” with Joan Cusack.  Joan Cusack was in “My Blue Heaven” with Steve Martin.  And Steve Martin was in “Novocain” with Kevin Bacon.  I changed the channel.  “The Gift” was on.  Keanu Reeves was in “The Matrix” with Carrie-Ann Moss.  Carrie-Ann Moss was in “Memento.”  My heart stopped cold.  Her.  Lyndsay. </p>
<p>“Memento” had been our last film together.  Ironic.  But that’s how our relationship was, like a Fellini film.  A lot of overwritten symbolism and very little action.  We met at a production of “Boy Meets Girl.”  Our first kiss on a moonlit pier after Prom.  Her lips.  Like velvet seats in a restored movie house.  Crimson.  Full.  Classic.  She dumped me in a graveyard.  Literally, the one off 14th.  Her eyes were the color of the grass that sprouted from beneath the tombstones, green with flecks of sparkling gold.  </p>
<p>But where was I?  Oh yes.  The shit.  The heat of the room had baked it into a brittle chalk.  The intrusive rays of the sun streamed into the room through the greasy blinds, illuminating the flakes of shit that had been kicked up by the fan.  It was like a putrid winter wonderland.  </p>
<p>Riiiiing.  Riiiing.</p>
<p>The phone.  I contemplated whether I should answer it or not.  Answering would require me to move and it was probably just some bill collector calling for my mother or my school counselor “concerned” about my streak of absences.  Ring!  What the hell?  I didn’t have anything better to do.  I rocked my weight to move my mass out of the sweat-laden depression I had made in the couch.  </p>
<p>“Mike?”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>It was Nitram, a kid I did theatre with awhile back.  A backstage kind of guy.  </p>
<p>“Bryan needs your help!  I’m not sure exactly what’s going on, but he sent some kids to tell me that some guys are after him and to call you for help.”</p>
<p>A feeling of importance washed over me.  I wasn’t some fat slob skipping class and wallowing in self-pity, I was a tortured hero.  The private dick, the mysterious stranger, with a warm bottle of brandy on the coffee table and a cigarette dangling from his lips.  I was the go-to guy.  I was the Bogart, the Clint Eastwood, the Han Solo.</p>
<p>“Mike, still there?”</p>
<p>“Yeah sorry.”</p>
<p>“He’s hiding in the field down the street from his house.  Meet him there.”</p>
<p>“I’m on it.”</p>
<p>I grabbed my weathered overcoat and felt fedora.  I stopped in front of the mirror to flip up my collar.  Sure, I resembled Orson Welles in “A Touch of Evil” more than any Bogart character, but the effect still worked.  Cocking my fedora over one eye, I left my home to go save the world.  </p>
<p><center>II.</center></p>
<p>Cut to the blazing sun.  The camera cranes downward to reveal a vast desolate field.  Stillness.  The relentless sun beat upon the earth, making the tall grass too exhausted to sway even an inch.  A cloud of dust disturbed the horizon as my Le Baron sputtered down the gravely path which cut through the center of the field.  I turned off the ignition and stepped out of the car, my face inadvertently impersonating Clint Eastwood as I attempted to squint through the glare and into the motionless grass.  I strode a few feet, the sound of the earth beneath my heel made the deafening silence more apparent.</p>
<p>I began to feel uneasy, maybe this was some type of setup.  Were police stationed in the brush, ready to gun me down like Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway?  Some chloroform-equipped suit to throw me into a van?  Should I be on watch for any low flying crop dusters who aim to silence me?  Rustling!  Behind me!  I whirled around and reached for my pistol.  Damn!  I didn’t own a gun.  Or a bullwhip or anything of use.  It looked like this would have to be mano y mano.   I put up my dukes, spat at the ground, and prepared for the upcoming tussle.  </p>
<p>Suddenly, a lanky figure came crashing through the brush.  With a dusty thud, the mass of dirt and foxtails landed at my feet.  It was Bryan.  Sure, it looked like the field had decided to play a tournament of ticktacktoe across his body, but it was Bryan nonetheless.  Gasping for air he clawed at the rear passenger-side door.  </p>
<p>“Drive!” </p>
<p><center>III.</center></p>
<p>We sped away from the field, earth shooting out from under my tires.  Bryan clasped a silver laptop across his heart as he lay down across the backseat in order to avoid any snipers in the nearby area.  </p>
<p>“You wanna let me know what’s going on here?”</p>
<p>My foot eased down further on the gas.</p>
<p>“I fucked up Mike.  I’m so fucked.  Fuck!  I’m so fucked!”</p>
<p>“What’d you do Bryan?”</p>
<p>I punched the gas to make the green light down the road.</p>
<p>“Some guys are after me…”</p>
<p>My hands gripped the wheel tightly as I sped toward the yellow light.</p>
<p>“…the Mexican mob.”</p>
<p>I slammed on the brake as the light changed red.</p>
<p>I swiveled my body around to get a good look at Bryan.  There he laid, gasping in a bed of McDonald’s wrappers and Diet Coke cans.  This was no joke.  My car rattled in idle while Bryan lets the blood drain from his sweat-drenched face.  He spoke in short gasps of air, like a B-movie actor delivering his final monologue on his deathbed.</p>
<p>The light turned green and I eased into the intersection and up the road.</p>
<p>“On my birthday.  I got a laptop from a friend of my dad’s.  It was stolen.”</p>
<p>I swerved to avoid a car that had changed lanes without signaling.  </p>
<p>“It had some software on it already.  For hacking and stuff.”</p>
<p>I sped through a yellow light.</p>
<p>“Pretty soon I could hack into the DMV’s website.”</p>
<p>My tires screeched as I made a sharp left hand turn, ignoring the stop sign.</p>
<p>“Manuel.  He’s my dad’s friend.  And his friend Rick.  They started asking me to make them fake I.D.’s.”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you did.”</p>
<p>“It was a bunch of money dude.”</p>
<p>Distracted, I had missed my turn.</p>
<p>“One day.  I was supposed to deliver to a guy named Bubba.”</p>
<p>The road narrowed and became a one-way street.</p>
<p>“And I was ten minutes late.”</p>
<p>My tires slammed against a pit in the road, my axel groaned.</p>
<p>“The cops found him.  Asleep.  In a stolen car.  With a smashed windshield.”</p>
<p>Shit.  No U-Turns.</p>
<p>“So Rick was like ‘You were late.  You pay for his bail.’”</p>
<p>A possible turnout appeared ahead.  </p>
<p>“And I was like ‘No.  I wasn’t the one stupid enough to fall asleep in a stolen car.’”</p>
<p>Damn, the road’s closed.</p>
<p>“That’s when he pulled the gun on me.”</p>
<p>My tires lost traction on the gravely road and I began to skid.</p>
<p>“I gave him the money I had on me.  But he wanted more.”</p>
<p>I regained traction in time to swerve around a washed out chasm in the road.</p>
<p>“So I stole some cash from my grandpa.”</p>
<p>The gravel was getting deep.</p>
<p>“He found out and started to beat me with his belt.”</p>
<p>More axel groans as my wheels found pothole after pothole.</p>
<p>“So I hit him back.”</p>
<p>Crack!  That didn’t sound good.</p>
<p>“He called the cops.  So I can’t go home…”</p>
<p>A streetlight up ahead.</p>
<p>“and Rick and Manuel are still after me.”</p>
<p>I turned on my blinker.</p>
<p>“So I hid out in this field by my house.”</p>
<p>It was a street which lead to my house.</p>
<p>“I had some kids go for Nitram to call you.”</p>
<p>Thank God.  The end of our journey.</p>
<p>“And you know the rest.”</p>
<p><center>IV.</center></p>
<p>Bryan and I raced inside my house.  We didn’t have much time.  It wouldn’t be long before the police began to check friends’ homes for the fugitive.  Although, the police were the least of my worries.  I glanced out the window to make sure no lowriders had shown up yet.</p>
<p>With the coast clear for now, I sent Bryan to take a shower while I arranged his escape.  He had a mother in Montana, and while it wasn’t exactly the most exciting of locales, it would have to do.  A few clicks of the mouse later, Bryan had a one-way ticket to the free north and I had an empty bank account.  We only had to survive till 8 a.m. tomorrow.</p>
<p>Now I had to create a disguise.  Bryan couldn’t run around in the clothes he had been last seen wearing.  Especially because a few summer days in the field had made his clothes stiff with the stench of shrubs and sweat.  </p>
<p>I raced into my room, looking for something that might work.  The problem was I had a good 200 pounds on him, and he had half a foot on me.  I needed something from a while ago, something from Jr. High where my girth was equal to a junior in High School.  I threw back the heavy lid on my sarcophagus.  It was a set piece my teacher had given to me and I had since used it as a sort of footlocker.  </p>
<p>I dug through the layers of my life.  A half eaten apple pie from last week, countless issues of the “Weekly World News,” that lost Pre-Cal book that kept me from receiving my diploma, a play-bill from “Repo, The Genetic Rock Opera,” pictures of Lyndsay and I at prom.  </p>
<p>Wow she looked good.  </p>
<p>And I looked like fat Elvis.  </p>
<p>Haven’t the time!  The libretto to “Man of La Mancha,” a few inches of movie ticket stubs, a book on card tricks and another on illusions to be performed with a fake thumb, a switchblade comb.  </p>
<p>Hmmm, this might come in handy.  Sure, if I am forced to use it the only hope I have of getting away is if Rick or Manuel are doubled over in laughter, but hopefully the prop could be used to intimidate without being opened.  </p>
<p>Here we are.  My collection of Hawaiian shirts from Jr. High.  I pulled out a sea-foam green XL with golden birds of paradise, pink hibiscus flowers, and bright yellow palm fronds.  One of my quieter designs.  I grabbed the shirt a pair of Jackson Pollack inspired parachute pants, and headed for the restroom.</p>
<p>Steam billowed out of the room as Bryan’s naked arm shot through the crack in the door to grab the clothes.  I waited in silence, the only sound being the hollow dripping from recently turned off faucet.  The room stunk of Zest.  </p>
<p>The door opened and out walked Bryan.  As the fog began to dissipate, the comedic picture began to materialize.  The shirt hung from Bryan’s frame, an empty ocean of neon flora.  It draped down to his knees, about two inches above where my pants stopped at his calves.  This would have to do. </p>
<p>Bryan walked over to the full length mirror/closet by the front door, leaving little foot-shaped pools where he walked.  </p>
<p>“This is going to help me blend in?  Heh, no.  Let’s try again.”</p>
<p>Knock!  The sound of knuckles smashing against my wooden door.  A coldness flowed over me, as if someone had poured a tub of ice-water down my spine.   I could see Bryan was having a similar experience.</p>
<p>Knock! Knock!</p>
<p>“Just a second!” I screamed out.</p>
<p>How could I be so stupid?  I left the lookout unmanned.  There were probably over a hundred cholos with flannel print shirts buttoned at the neck.  A sea of dew-rags.  All waiting to cut me open and play mariachi music with my vital organs.  </p>
<p>I slid open the mirror door and tossed Bryan inside.  Slowly I turned toward the door, my hand ready to pull out my switchblade comb.  It is a strange feeling opening a door to a stranger.  Only a thick slat of wood separating you two.  Being inches from their face and still having no inkling about what you may be giving an opening to.</p>
<p>My clammy hand gripped the cold brass knob.  The gears clinked loudly with every degree I turned my hand.  The hinges screamed out in warning.  Air began to seep through the widening crack.  More squealing from the terrified hinges.  The door was now open a foot; I was a dead man.  I stepped into the setting sun, blinding me from the outside world as I awaited my execution; the dead weight of the door pulled it fully open.</p>
<p><p>“Evening sir.  Officer Campbell with the Riverside Police Department.”</p>
<p>Oh God.  These men were trained to kill.</p>
<p>“May I come in?”</p>
<p>I weakly nodded my head and stepped backwards into the room.  </p>
<p>His boots clicked against the wooden floor as he penetrated my house, his bear-sized paw gripping the brass handle as a child grips a bee by its wrings.  The door was closed.  And I was trapped.  </p>
<p>“Do you know a boy by the name of Bryan Myers?”</p>
<p>Sure I did.  He was squatting over a sewing machine one foot to the left of him.  </p>
<p>“I was friends with him for awhile.”</p>
<p>He took a step closer.</p>
<p>“When was the last time you saw him?”</p>
<p>“Friday.  At school.  But we didn’t talk really.  I mean we did talk, but not about anything important.  Not that our conversations are all that important.  Just about everyday crap.  Nothing spectacular.”</p>
<p>Real cool Mike. </p>
<p>“Anyone else at home?”</p>
<p>Shit.  A corrupt cop.  He was going to get his man no matter what it took.  Should I confess?  I mean, how long can a kid get for stealing a few bucks from his grandfather?  And hitting him?  And making fake I.D.’s for the Mexican mob?  Well, at least he would be safe inside.  Inside with a bunch of gangsters.  Maybe even Bubba.  But at least I’d be safe.  And we all know how well Judas adjusted to selling out his pal.  I’d just have to steer clear of any rope for a little while and I’d be okay.  </p>
<p>But he had trusted me.  With his life.  He was now dripping sweat and probably other liquids feet from me.  Like those Jewish kids in “Schindler’s List,” squatting in a latrine to avoid the corrupt Nazis.  I was Schindler.  </p>
<p>“Nobody but me officer.”</p>
<p>Smiling he strode further into the room.</p>
<p>“Well, Bryan ran away from home.  And if he doesn’t get home by tomorrow evening, he could be arrested.  And I know you don’t want that Mike.”</p>
<p>It seemed all they wanted him for was running away from home.  Maybe the police didn’t even know about the laptop and the mob.</p>
<p>He stopped in front of the computer screen.  Shit.  A confirmation for a one-way ticket to Montana was still on the screen.  But he wasn’t interested in that.</p>
<p>“Nice laptop.  Yours?”</p>
<p>He knew.  How powerful was this laptop?  Gangsters all over Riverside County were hunting Bryan down for its contents.  And now the police were on it too.  </p>
<p>The desk groaned as his 6 foot 4 framed leaned against it.  He picked up the laptop, and began to examine the sacred object.</p>
<p>“All alone eh?”</p>
<p>He was going to kill me for the laptop.  Two in the chest, one in the head and I would go down in the books as being hostile.  Pulling a switchblade on an officer.  And the laptop would disappear.  </p>
<p>“Yes, but my mother’s home from work any minute.”</p>
<p>Yeah, take that mother fucka.</p>
<p>Putting the laptop down on the desk, he sauntered across the room and back to the door.  </p>
<p>“Well, if you happen to hear anything, be sure to give me a call.”</p>
<p>With that he turned around.  It was the first time I had looked at his face fully.  His chew stained grin, like a mouth of greasy candy corn.  His leather skin, containing the evidence of many tussles and brawls.  </p>
<p>His paw lay extended toward me as he held out his card.  I took it.  As he gripped the brass knob he glanced at my Vans-clad feet.  He looked up and winked at me.</p>
<p>“Better wipe up that water on the floor.  Wouldn’t want anybody to slip.”</p>
<p>My eyes shot to the living room floor, a trail of wet footprints leading from the bathroom to the mirror.  I turned to sputter some excuse, but he was gone.</p>
<p>He would be back tonight.  As soon as he found out my mom was committed, or waited long enough to know she wasn’t coming home.  He would be back.  In the cloak of night.  Bryan and I would disappear.  Our face on some poster in a Wal-Mart entrance.  And the laptop would be his.  We had to hideout till tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><center>V.</center></p>
<p>I had finally gotten my breath back.  We were in a comfortable environment, where we could most definitely blend in.  The best part, it was open late.  “Back to the Grind,” an artsy independent coffee house in downtown right between a gay bar and a comic book store.  The room was filled with students, a meeting ground between the local junior college as well as the University.  I took in a deep breath, sharing the same air as these artists, the same air that was breathed by the wall of books, the same air that was breathed by the original oil and acrylic paintings that covered the sides of this little dive.  In a few moments Bryan would be back from the bathroom, we would get some kick-ass coffee, and we would shoot the shit till 2 am.</p>
<p>I had only come here a few times before.  They were recording some CD for original musicians by my High School down the street.  I had done an ill-humored parody of a Disney song called “Hafta go Pee.”  It bombed horribly.  I learned that urine jokes are hard to maintain for 5 minutes.  But I didn’t care at the time.  My eyes were on the back of the room.  Where she sat.  Her green eyes beaming with love and support.  </p>
<p>Maybe she would show up tonight.  Bump into me while grabbin’ a cup of Joe.  I could tell her my heroic story.  How I was so responsible that a friend turned to me first for help.  How I lost the guy who was tailing me, outwitted a villainous cop, and was prepared to battle the entire mob in the name of valor and honor.  </p>
<p>Or better yet, maybe some femme fatale would sit at my table.  And Lyndsay would come in to see her running her fingers through my hair, her wicked hand on my thigh.  Then she could see how much I care for her.  How I would toss aside the peroxide blonde and choose her.  She would swoon in my arms.  Our happy ending.  How I would long to fade to black.  Maybe.</p>
<p>Bryan came jogging back to the table.  He was in better spirits as well.  He sat eagerly at our table.</p>
<p>“Mike, guess what?  Blythe’s on her way!”</p>
<p>Blythe, Bryan’s bitchy girlfriend.  His worser half.  The sole reason I ran for theatre president.  I almost felt bad when she cried.  Heh.  Almost.  She was one of those types who wore the “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” shirts, she quoted “Friends” non stop, she created her own Ya-Ya Sisterhood after the film.  Hack.</p>
<p>“She can only sneak out of her house for a little bit.”</p>
<p>“Pity.”</p>
<p>“She knows it is my last night in California.  How I might not see her again.  And she agreed that what we have is special.  A specialness that…”</p>
<p>“She agreed to sleep with you.”</p>
<p>“Yes!  We’re finally going to do it!”</p>
<p>“Congratulations.  So where do I fit into this?  Unless…Well, I never figured her that type of girl.”</p>
<p>“No, no, no.  She’s going to park in the garage out back.  I’m going to go meet her back there.  Like I said, she couldn’t sneak out too long.”</p>
<p>“So I sit and wait here while you get lucky?”</p>
<p>“I owe you man!”</p>
<p>Then like a child who was just told he is leaving for Disneyland, he was hopping and skipping out the back door.  </p>
<p>“Bet your ass you owe me.”</p>
<p>Maybe it was better this way.  Bryan didn’t really have a place at the table for my fantasy involving the fatale and Lyndsay.  He would just get in the way.  So I relaxed, and began to examine the room for prospects.</p>
<p>The room was filled with artists in the making.  A den of creativity.  I saw a young Orson Welles, telling a friend about his perfect screenplay.  Poe sat in a dark corner, scribbling away in a weathered notebook.  Bukowski sat at the bar, entertaining friends while he slammed back glass after glass of wine.  And across the room was Sylvia Plath, dark and beautiful as she traced the scars that ran down her arms.  </p>
<p>I don’t know why I didn’t come here more often.  These were my people.  Filmmakers, animators, poets, and writers.  They were all congregating here.  Here, while incense filtered through the air and jazz music echoed in the great hall.  Go on Bryan, take your time.</p>
<p>A hand came to rest upon my shoulder.  </p>
<p>“Hello friend.  Mind if I have a seat.”</p>
<p>It certainly wasn’t Rick or Manuel.  And I didn’t see how a man of his sorts would be an undercover cop, so I nodded at the chair.  He was short, pudgy, and appeared to be philipinno.  </p>
<p>“My friend, you have a weird aura around you.</p>
<p>“Must be the coffee.  Gives me gas.”</p>
<p>“No my friend, aura.  It is a spirtual…”</p>
<p>“I know what it is, just making a joke.  And as far as my aura.  Yeah, I’m having a strange day.”</p>
<p>“I know all about that my friend.  Today I found out that I was Jesus.”</p>
<p>I suppressed all urges to do a joke about finding Jesus and allowed him to continue.</p>
<p>“Yes my friend.  My name is John Cuervos.  At least that’s what my birth certificate says.  But look at the initials, ‘J.C.’.”</p>
<p>Yeah, this guy was tweaked out.  His pupils were the size of dinner plates and often darted in opposite directions.  I nodded and glanced at the clock on the wall.</p>
<p>“It came to me earlier.  Yeah.  I was like watching T.V., and it started talking to me.  Telling me I was Jesus.  Listen my friend, I was freaked out.  But it made sense.  My mother, her name is Mary.  My father is Joe, and he divorced my mom because he said she slept around.  My friend, I am Jesus Christ.”  </p>
<p>“Congratulations.  What are you going to do next?” </p>
<p>“I do not know.  That is why I came unto you.  I do not know what is real anymore my friend.  You know what I am talking about?</p>
<p>“No clue.”  </p>
<p>Where the hell was Bryan.</p>
<p>“In America, Jesus is like Levis or Old Navy, a…a…”</p>
<p>“Brand name.” </p>
<p>“Yes, a brand name.  Jesus shirts and Jesus hats.  He is even at the drive-thru my friend.”</p>
<p>“Drive-thru?”</p>
<p>“In-n-Out.  The bottom of their cups.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>“So I don’t know what is real anymore.  Am I Jesus?  Or am I John Cuervo?  Maybe I think I Jesus because I wear him.  I read him every week.  He is around my neck.  On my key chains.  ‘What would Jesus do,’ y’know my friend?  He is in my car.  On my dashboard.  Listen to me my friend!”</p>
<p>Where could he be?  He was a virgin and virgin’s don’t last this long their first time!</p>
<p>“Everyone talks about Him.  Says he was so great.  How we are so nothing.  Maybe I want to be like Him to be great.  Seeing him in every window thinking it is my own reflection.  They are trying to make us all like Jesus.  United States of Jesus.”</p>
<p>Jesus Christ!  Where was he?!</p>
<p>“And if I am Christ, will I live up?  We been made obsessed.  Making Him  more big and  more pure and more smart.  Building their world around a story, a feeling.  What if he is just me?  Will they still love me my friend?  Look at me!  My friend!  Would you follow a guy who looked like me?  Leave your friends and follow me?”</p>
<p>That’s when I saw him.  Through the window.  A scraggly Mexican figure.  A grizzled face sprouting thin wisps of black hair.  His greasy hair in tendrils that fell over his face, concealing his eyes.  He looked like he had stepped off the set of a Sergio Leonne picture.  Manuel.  </p>
<p>This was a trap.  A set-up.  They had sent me here to get lost in conversation with these artists.  Then they sent in Jesus when I approached nobody.  </p>
<p>The Eagles had replaced the jazz music.  “Hotel California” was now being piped into the chamber.  Jesus was laughing from across the table, his tan pudgy palms slapping against the wooden table.  His laugh was shrill and sadistic.  Everything began to blur.  Colors mixed together as Joe Walsh’s voice melded with our savior’s laughs.  </p>
<p>Mirrors on the ceiling, pink champagne on ice </p>
<p>I had been drugged.  Poisoned to get me out of the way.  They were here to kill Bryan.</p>
<p>We are all just prisoners here of our own device</p>
<p>And they were all in on it.  Fakes and frauds.  Orson Welle’s film pitch was a sequel to “White Chicks.”  Sylvia Plath giggled every time she went to slit her wrists for the blade tickled her skin so.  Bukowski’s glass was filled with Hawaiian punch!  </p>
<p>And in the master's chambers they gathered for the feast</p>
<p>I rose slowly as Jesus laughed like Lao Che in the beginning of “Temple of Doom.”  How could I be so careless?  The faces blurred as I swayed to and fro.  The laughing needed to stop.  I thrust all my weight forward and landed a right hook in Christ’s jaw.  The others began to approach.</p>
<p>They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can't kill the beast</p>
<p>I picked up the chair and heaved it into Shakespeare’s chest, shattering against his cardboard doublet.  Frenzied and loosing more and more coordination with every passing second, I threw over the table onto the Pacific Island Prophet who lay collapsed on the ground.  I needed to escape before the drug took full affect.</p>
<p>Last thing I remember I was running for the door. I had to find the passage back to the place I was before</p>
<p>Leading with my shoulders, I crashed through hack after hack.  Tables and chairs tumbling in my wake.  I was almost to the door.  My left leg dragged behind me, now completely numb.  I fell against the door with all my weight.  My hand searched for the handle as my vision blurred further.  Locked.</p>

<p>They were closing in on me.  Hacks and imposters, their faces salivating, their fists clenching.  I didn’t have the time or the to fight my way back through the lounge and out the front door.  Like every film version of the Alamo, this would not end well.  The chorus chanted eerily calm in juxtaposition of the violent tension about to snap.</p>
<p>My luck.  The owner was walking towards me to suppress me.  Everyone was in on this.  But I could use him!  Action!</p>
<p>I grabbed a nearby cup and tossed the steaming coffee into the owners face.  As he screamed in pain, I grabbed the keys that hung from his belt.  </p>
<p>I tried the first key.  No good.  A fist collided with my right shoulder.  I swung around to deliver a kick to Arthur Miller’s crotch.  </p>
<p>Second key.  Not even close.  Nails dug into right cheek.  I tore off the enraged Dickenson and threw her back against the bookshelf, thick novels crashing down upon her head.  </p>
<p>Third key.  Success, three’s a charm.  I ducked as a mic stand banged against the wooden door.  I grabbed the bent pole and slammed it backwards into the face of Kurosawa.  My hand found the knob behind me and turned. I fell backwards through the open door, my battered remains landing in a fleshy thud among cigarette buts and drunken urine from the bar next door.  My good foot reared up and swiftly kicked the door shut. </p>
<p>Tears tugged at my eyes, wanting to break free in exhausted joy that I had made it this far.  Lying in the gutter, my feet propped against the door, the muffled sounds of the mob seeping through the pounding door in violent vibrations.  It wouldn’t belong before they broke through.  </p>
<p>I scrambled to my feet, dripping with grayish filth that smelt of urine and old shoeboxes.   I limped my way through a dark alley, my foot dragging through the grime in the gutter, the screaming voices behind me.  Cold sweat dripped down my face as I continued to struggle against the crippling drug I wanted to stop and puke.  To give in to the pain and the poison.  But I had to save Bryan.  So I pressed on, up the concrete drives, looking for that powder-blue Jetta.  </p>
<p>On the second level I found it.  Rockin’ away with the windows fully fogged.  I scrambled up to the car, blood congealing on my cheek, my body aching from the series of blows I had received.  With a heavy thud I collapsed against the rear passenger door.  </p>
<p>“Bryan” I cried out.  </p>
<p>I reached down and grabbed the door handle and swung the door open.  </p>
<p>Wow, Blythe had nice tits.  </p>
<p>I had never seen Lyndsay’s.  She wanted me to, but I failed to make any moves.  I didn’t want to appear eager like the rest of those assholes.  Regret dripped down my throat and burnt holes in my stomach.  </p>
<p>“Mike!” Bryan and Blythe screamed in unison.  </p>
<p>I was still staring at her breasts.  Shaking my head, as if to clear it from the surge of testosterone, I grabbed Bryan and began to pull him from the car.  </p>
<p>“He’s here!  Manuel’s here!”</p>
<p>Bryan’s eyes adjusted to the low lighting and saw my bloody and bruised face.  </p>
<p>Nodding his head solemnly he said “okay.”  </p>
<p><center>VI.</center></p>
<p>Blythe had been nice enough to drop us off at my car.  I lay collapsed in the passenger seat, the drug wearing off.  It was 1:10; we only had to survive for less than seven hours.  We just needed a place to pass the next few hours.  And I had just the place.  </p>
<p>It was called Arnold Heights, a dilapidated housing community for the families of those working at March Air Field.  After the cold war had ended, families moved from the housing and it was left untouched till this day.  Sure, the occasional hobo spent the night there, or kids went there to tell ghost stories, but it was so far out of the way it had remained Riverside’s secret.  And tonight it would be our sanctuary.  </p>
<p>Driving up to the place it is no surprise people come here to tell ghost stories.  It is surrounded by neglected fields, with thick twisted trees sprouting up at odd angles, their branches bare and gnarled.  There is no grass or vegetation, just the bones of thorny bushes, intertwining in sharp dry brambles.  </p>
<p>Soon the community appears on the horizon.  Short squat yellow houses, designed in the typical 50’s style.  Wooden telephone poles sprout up around the houses, still connected by power lines, yet with no electricity flowing through them.  The air is always still at Arnold Heights, and even in the daylight it is a place of gloom and shadow.  A city of the dead.  </p>
<p>We took the small dirt-path detour that led around the barricades of the community.  We passed over the wooden wire fence that once surrounded the town to keep trespassers out.  My LeBaron’s front tires dropped, then the back ones.  We were inside.</p>
<p>We both said nothing.  The area felt so unnatural.  Unlit streetlights, street signs covered in rust directing us to lost avenues and parkways.  Stop signs still instructing us to stop.  Houses left empty, windows unboarded, doors unlocked, just empty.  </p>
<p>The road itself looked like an oily still river covered in sticks.  Fallen branches from surrounding trees crunched under the wheels of the car, their twigs scratching at the underside of my car like fingernails on a coffin lid.  </p>
<p>We had to just find a place to hide the car then we could curl up on some kitchen floor’s tile and get some sleep.  The sun would rise and this would be over.  </p>
<p>Headlights reflected in the maze of empty windows.  Every turn made us tense up for it was hard to tell if they were indeed our headlights reflecting.  </p>
<p>There were some chunks of foundation lying in the middle of the street.  There was not enough empty road on either side so I guided my car over the chunks.  Bad move.  We heard a grinding noise as the concrete scraped through my car.  Press on, it’s nothing.  I could now feel it passing beneath my foot.  The car floor rising up into a sharp edge half an inch high.  No, I had to stop.  I couldn’t let it cut a gas line or even worse, a brake line.  We were going to have to lift the tail end of my car up enough for us to wheelbarrow it over the rock.  </p>
<p>Bryan and I stepped out of the car.  The air so still where it becomes hard to breath.  Bryan grabbed on end of the fender, and I the other.  One.  Two.  Headlights.  </p>
<p>Yes they were headlights.  Moving. They couldn’t be mine.  Some teenagers?  A lost motorist?  No, a third light accompanied the pair of headlights, it was a searchlight.  Someone had seen us enter.  Bryan and I dropped the car and took off into the darkness.  The headlights were turning the corner.  They would soon be on our street.  Bryan raced back to the car and through open the rear door.  The searchlight scanned up and down empty houses looking for a sign of life to descend upon.  Bryan was still rummaging through the back seat.  I could now make out the military vehicle that would soon be upon us.  Bryan raced back towards me, laptop in hand and dove into the decayed bush I hid in just as the search light scanned over our heads.  </p>
<p>Shadowed figures swooped down upon the car.  Rummaging and searching through the thick clutter.  They were looking for something.  My eyes fell on the laptop that Bryan had clasped against his chest.  Christ, even the military wanted it.  Carefully we inched backwards into the building behind us.  </p>
<p>It was the community center for Arnold Heights.  We crawled through dirt and rat droppings under the pool table.  We scampered across the now vacant dance floor.  And then we were out the back.  We sprinted through the basketball court and towards the houses on the other side of the street.  Headlights!  </p>
<p>We stood frozen in the headlights, awaiting a silent swift death.  A reflection, it was just a reflection.  We began to run through the streets, flashlights bobbed up and down in the windows.  Headlights turned towards us then away.  What was real?  Racing through this funhouse of mirrors, we had no idea where we were going.  Were we gaining ground, loosing ground, heading straight for them?  We needed to find someplace to hide away.  In a house.  I saw an open door at the end of the road.  We raced past the hall of windows, lights revealing us for moments.  Had we been spotted or were they more reflections?  </p>
<p>Our shoes thudded loudly as we entered the house.  Hide.  Some place to hide.  No furniture in the living room.  The bedrooms were empty as well.  The kitchen.  Lined with cabinets and drawers, it would be perfect.  I hoisted Bryan into a cupboard above the hole where the fridge should be.  I crowded myself under the sink.  </p>
<p>And there we lay all night.  I heard cars drive past the house.  Bodies moving in the darkness.  Footsteps.  How close they got I will never know.  Did they enter our house?  Search the rooms?  Stand in the kitchen?  The thought turned my veins to ice.</p>
<p>But we did make it.  I awoke on the kitchen floor.  In the course of the evening I had drifted off and fallen out of the cupboard.  Immediately I jumped up to run.  But it was morning.  The sun was rising and reflecting across Arnold Heights.  There were no signs of the dark searchers.  I opened the cabinet door to see how Bryan was.  There he lay, curled up around his laptop.  That damn laptop.  I peeled it from his grip and closed his door.  </p>
<p>I wanted to know what lay inside.  What secrets, what treasures.  But would I too be unable to part with it?  Crave it?  No, it had to stop here.  </p>
<p>So I went out the door and found a swimming pool next door.  It had been drained and leaves collected on the concrete floor.  In the light of the morning sun I walked forward to the diving board.  I placed my foot on the plastic turquoise board.  It seemed secure enough.  I placed one foot in front of the other, walking down the wobbly board, the laptop in my outstretched hands.  It must end here.  </p>
<p>I raised it above my head into the cleansing light of the sun.  Then, with all my might, I slammed the notebook into the depths of the pool, its case shattering upon impact.  </p>
<p>I looked towards the rising sun.  It was a little past five a.m.  In less than three hours Bryan would be on a flight to his mother’s house.  We had done it.  Bryan had survived.  It was our happy ending.  Fade to black.</p>
<p><center>Epilogue</center></p>
<p>Except in the real world, nothing fades to black.  Life keeps coming at you.  The weeks went by and the smile began to melt from my face.  Nothing happened.  At first I began to suspect a sequel.  Maybe Bryan was in some trouble in Montana and needed my help.  Or the mob finds out I was in on his escape and he has to come down to save me.  Or the government is able to salvage the laptop and I must save the world from its contents.  But nothing happened.  </p>
<p>I watched out my windows, waiting.  I sat and watched for days sometimes, not moving.  My eyes burning from lack of sleep.  But nobody came.  The phone did not ring.  No knocks at my door.  Once again, I meant nothing.  As Danny Kaye said, “A jester unemployed is nobodies fool.”  I was a hero unemployed.</p>
<p>My mother was released eventually.  When she came back she began to look for men instantly and was getting married within 4 months.  It wouldn’t be long before she discovered she had picked another asshole who would torment her, cheat on her, and eventually leave her without warning.  Then she would go back into the asylum.  Life goes on.  </p>
<p>Bryan became a burden for his mother.  Not only was he lazy and shiftless, but he kept shooting off his California mouth and pissing off the natives.  He eventually got some freshman pregnant and went to jail for statutory rape.  Life goes on.</p>
<p>Lyndsay had another boyfriend.  Some guy with screwed up teeth that wrote poetry in his own invented language.  Life goes on.  </p>
<p>My glazed pupils fell upon the T.V.  It was around 1:50 p.m. so all the movies and shows on were wrapping up.  Happy endings.  A man saving his friend from falling off a cliff.  Fade to black.  A father and son reunited.  Fade to black.  The bride kisses the groom and tosses the bouquet.  Fade to black.  Happy endings.  </p>
<p>The trouble with happy endings is they are unattainable.  Life does not end after the marriage ceremony or the winning soccer game.  It goes on.  It goes on into miserable mediocrity.  Everybody’s story ends with death.  A tragedy.  A tragedy as the person realizes they have spent their entire life striving for their happy ending, an impossible dream.  </p>
<p>I now say “Happy endings are a promise already broken.”  Hollywood had made me her fool.  </p>
<p>A child of seventeen sits in a vacant home, his cries echoing through empty halls.  He tears down the movie posters, throws out the VHS, and unplugs the television.  He returns to the couch, settling into his old depression.  Hope has died.  Tragedy.  Fade to black.</p>
