<center><b>Iguanas</b><br>
By Richard Mills</center><br><br>

<p>We were on the Wampu River in eastern Honduras during the dry season. Nonetheless, it rained every day, and at different times, so it was difficult to plan when to seek shelter. We were wet most of the time. It was hot, but wet boots and socks never dry out. Not good for fungus infections. But things could have been worse, I guess. </p>
<p>The geologic work was going well. We were seeing more outcrops than I expected and the structure on the river was not too complex. The stratigraphy, however, was perplexing. It was essentially a metamorphosed section: slates, quartzites, schists, etc., but now and then some massive, unaltered limestone appeared.  </p>
<p>The rock outcrops were mostly in the river and formed shoals and rapids. The banks of the river were overgrown with massive jungle. Giant mahogany trees, rubber trees, banana trees, balsa trees, lush ferns, extreme brush, all covered with intertwined vines that provided pathways for a variety of wildlife, which leads to our main problem: hunger.</p>
<p>We had pre-stocked pretty well with rice, beans, oatmeal, macaroni, sardines, powdered milk, and coffee. Although we now were on a river, voyaging in a dugout canoe, previously we had been climbing over a mountain range and carrying all our supplies. There were no pack animals in this remote region. We hired some local natives, but they insisted on a cash advance, got drunk, stole some of our food, and disappeared. Hence our cargo had to be light. And then there was the rain and the bugs. The rice and macaroni were ruined during the first rain. In the beans we discovered gargojoes, a small crab-like animal that was not indigestive, but in fact  added some protein. But after the beans were wet for a week, the gargojoes turned rancid and we had to discard this valuable source of food. So we were down to some stale, wet tortillas, two cans of sardines, and coffee. </p>
<p>We had borrowed a rifle, but neither of us were good shots. Large wildlife was scarce mainly because of the tigres, a form of leopard, that attacked the deer and tapirs. The tigres often prowled our campsites at night; we would wake and see their yellow eyes. We finally bagged a wild turkey and that gave us food for a week. But then we saw no more turkeys. However, aloft in the vines, there were abundant monkeys, macaws, and iguanas. We were reluctant to shoot the beautiful macaws, and we could not seem to hit the spidery, fast swinging monkeys. That left the iguanas.</p>
<p>We only saw the iguanas when they moved; but they seemed to sense when we were looking at them, particularly when we raised our rifle. Then they scooted behind a tree branch or a thick vine. Things were looking pretty bleak. The tortillas were gone and we had one can of sardines left.</p>
<p>One evening, while savoring the last sardine in the rain, we had unexpected visitors. It was a Moskito Indian with his young son. They had been visiting some relatives near the headwaters of the Wampu River and now were on their way home, which was on the Patuca River near the mouth of the Wampu, about 50 kilometers downstream. For several days, unbeknown to us, they had been following with the hope of sharing some food, mainly beans. We smiled and offered them the sardine can which still had some oil in it. Over the flickering campfire, they deliciously licked up every drop.</p>
<p>After this repast, we smoked our pipes and got to know our new companions. The father's Spanish was quite good, and to our amazement, the boy, 12 years old, could speak a little English that he had learned at the school in Awas, a small missionary community on the Patuca River. After awhile, the rain stopped and we rigged up our jungle hammocks in preparation for sleep. The Moskitos quickly fashioned a lean-to from banana leaves. Before retiring, the father, Miguel, mused, "Tomorrow, we must find food or we will have to bury our norte americanoes on a sand bar."</p>
<p>The next day we saw a doe with two fawns. My partner fired three shots, but they missed, and the deer disappeared into the forest. Miguel asked for the rifle and followed the animals. Soon we heard one shot, and then Miguel emerged on the river bank about 100 meters down stream with the doe on his back. That evening we camped on a large sand bar and Miguel and his son dressed the deer and we quickly boiled tender filets. The remainder of the meat was salted, broiled over the fire, re-salted, and hung on poles. Finally we had food for the remainder of the journey. But that was not all.  Miguel could shoot fish in shallow water with his bow and arrow. One morning they discovered a nest of turtle eggs. They had some flour along with their salt, and they made some delicious turtle-egg pan cakes. We were getting fat with so much food. But that was not enough, the Moskitos wanted a delicacy: iguana.</p>
<p>Five or six large iguanas had been following us in the tree vines for the last several days. Sometimes they purposely fell off the vines and plunged into the river. They were diving for fish. but once in the water, we never saw them again. These were big iguanas, some six feet long from nose to tail-tip. They were colorful with multihued neck armor that changed with chameleon quality. They were extremely fast even though they were running on short squat legs with long claws for grasping the vines. They rarely opened their mouths except to eat and then they revealed very long sharp teeth. Something you would not want to put your hand into. And they were silent. They never seemed to communicate with each other, even during the mating process. Iguanas are the last large reptiles. They seemed to have survived the massive extinction caused by the meteor impact that occurred sixty million years ago. Maybe it was intended for them to be silent forever so no one would know about the horror of the event that happened in ancient Yucatan that was then attached to North America. </p>
<p>Miguel cautioned us to be silent as we glided around a sharp bend in the river. We watched the overhead vines and soon two enormous iguanas pitched off their stronghold and plummeted into the river in a clumsy end-over-end fall. They were not Olympic divers. Miguel immediately plunged into the river that was a deep pool at this point. He was under water for almost four minutes. We thought he had drowned, but his son shook his head and cautioned patience. At last Miguel emerged downstream on the edge of the pool where it was shallow and he could stand. He was grasping a long iguana with both hands. It must have weighed at least sixty pounds. Miguel had chased the big animal to the bottom of the pool, grabbed his tail, and then rode him as he tried to escape. Eventually he guided him into shallow water and now he was struggling to keep from losing his catch. While I took a picture, my partner secured a rope around the iguanas hind-quarters and yanked him into the canoe. There was a lot flopping around and we nearly turned the canoe over. We finally tied the iguana down, but his security was precarious. Miguel said he needed a brother, maybe two. </p>
<p>We continued cruising. I tried to make some geological observations but our new friend was too violent for concentration. His tail kept getting loose and he nearly flayed us alive. Soon we spotted another iguana making a quixotic dive and Miguel was right after him. This one was a modest four feet long, mainly because he had lost part of his tail. We tied the two together and this prevented either from thrashing about. I expected we would be having roasted iguana that night. But not so.</p>
<p>The iguanas were for the family back home. We had plenty of deer meat and we were finding more turtle eggs. I had eaten iguana on a previous trip and it can be delicious if cooked right, so we had that to look forward to as a farewell banquet. But I worried about the iguanas dying of exposure. We were still five days from the mouth of the Wampu. Miguel shook his head and explained that iguanas can live for a year under confinement without food or water. We would feast on the small animal, but the big one would be kept for a special occasion, maybe Christmas. Christmas was seven month away.  Nonetheless I felt compassion for the creatures. In fact as the days went by I tried to give them water. I propped up their heads and held a handful of water under their snouts. They kept their jaws clamped shut, but turned their heads and gave me a friendly beady eye. The sun shown deep in their sockets and I imagined that the fire from the holocaust at Chixculub, sixty million years ago, was still there; they could never forget. They had lost all their big brothers—the Brontosaurus, the Plesiosaur, and the enormous flying reptile, the Pterandon. No wonder they were stoic and could endure hardship which ended in carnivorous death. </p>
<p>After a hard week, poling and portaging down the river, trying to understand the difficult geology, we finally reached the mouth of the river and found Miguel's house. It was on a bluff of Lower Cretaceous limestone that had a commanding view of the Patuca River and the mighty Colon Mountains beyond. It was the junction of not only two great rivers but also two great faults that formed the rivers. Much had happened in this area and the geologic events made a spectacular landscape, with wide expanses of river, spectacular rapids that never ceased exclaiming their presence, encroaching forests trying, but never succeeding, to strangle the water ways, and finally soaring limestone blocks made majestic with smooth dip slopes away from abrupt fault planes.</p>
<p>At sunset the river junction was alive with enormous bull frogs that held deafening conversations long into the night.   They might have been sharing memories about when they were all a part of southern Mexico, but more likely they were talking about mating under the pregnant moon.  It was the perfect music to sleep to on our first dry night.</p>
<p>The next day we ate the smaller iguana. Miguel's family had chopped him up and the best pieces were wrapped in banana leaves, salted with jungle herbs, and roasted in a charcoal pit all night long. With fresh bananas and rice, the iguana made a gourmet feast. His larger and—for the moment—safer companion watched all of this with unblinking eyes. He had been liberated and was in a chicken wire cage below the house.  Miguel's children promised not to eat him, at least not until Christmas.</p>
<p>My partner and I bid farewell to the Moskito family and journeyed by canoe down the Patuca River to an airstrip near Huampusirpe. Before leaving Miguel's house I tickled my iguana friend under the chin and he opened his jaws enough to simulate a smile.  I never saw any of them again. </p>
