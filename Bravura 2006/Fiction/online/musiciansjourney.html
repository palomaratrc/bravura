<center><b>Musician’s Journey</b><br>
By Michelle Eichelberger</center><br><br>

<p>“Na, Na, Na, man!  We have to make this tight. The gig is next week and we have to get these tunes down.  Let’s take it from the top again.  Randall, make sure to throw in that lick during the bridge.  Carroway, you have to keep that beat in the pocket, man!” exclaims Sherman, a very dedicated band leader and bass player.  Sherman had put a band together before and it failed miserably after the musicians didn’t take their roles seriously.  The whole experience gave him a bad reputation that he has been working hard to heal. So, he has much at stake with this new gig opportunity.</p>
<p>“All right, man.  Count it off for me so I know where you want it,” says Carroway the drummer, looking a little annoyed at being chastised.</p>
<p>“Randall, did you make the charts for Gustavo?” barks Sherman with the expectation in his voice that Randall didn’t do it.  This is the third time Randall, the arrogant guitar player, is being asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah! They’re right here.” snaps Randall.  Randall has a bad habit of thinking he is a god among the little people.  A god that can’t be bothered with menial tasks like writing charts for another musician who should be able to do it for himself.</p>
<p>“Good. We don’t want to half ass this shit.” Sherman snaps back.  </p>
<p>The gig is in one week and tension is high. Everyone is feeling the pressure.  We all know that landing this gig permanently will give us an “in” into a very lucrative music circuit.</p>
<p>“OK, then. Mario, you take the high harmony this time around and I’ll come in with the lows.” Sherman continues to order.</p>
<p>“ Cool.  That’s cool with me.” replies Mario, seeming to be the coolest of all the band members.  He has played very high- end professional gigs with some national acts so he is used to having to improv if he has to.  He has a confidence that only comes with experience and a presence that demands recognition; he has been around awhile.  While he is co-lead on vocals, he can play every instrument very well and knows what he’s talking about.  When he opens his mouth to make a suggestion, everyone listens.</p>
<p>“Gustavo, this time, let’s do a little salsa kinda flava thang in the intro.” instructs Sherman, as he lightens the mood just enough to get people refocused by playfully acting like a drugged up salsa dancer.</p>
<p>“Whatever you want, man,” chuckles the Cuban keyboardist. </p>
<p>Gustavo is a short, stocky, classically trained pianist with stubby little fingers you never would imagine could fly across the keyboard the way they do.  He’s very eager to please, tries to communicate as best he can with his very broken English, and plays with a passion that can give you the chills.</p>
<p>“And Michelle, let us run through this one time and then you can come in with the vocals.  Don’t wanna blow your chops out.” warns Sherman. </p>
<p>“OK.” I answer.  I am relieved to be working with a musician that respects and acknowledges that I have an internal instrument that requires some finessing.</p>
<p>“All right then.  We have rehearsal tonight until we get it right so let’s not be here all night.” says Sherman with a tone that reflects little confidence that it will be an early night.  He raises his head and makes eye contact with each band member (the eye contact is a silent recognition by all that we are about to begin).  He raises his eyebrows, and as he lowers his head he counts it off, “One…two…one, two, three…” Music fills every corner of the room.  Vibration runs through our bodies, and together, we are on a ride of our own creation.</p>
<p>Each band you come across will have some variation of the above dialogue.  As with any discourse community, musicians have their own unique way of talking.  Gig, licks, runs, bridge, chops, solo, and hook are just a few of the words that are unique to this group.  I choose to sing and perform music that has Pop, R&B, Latin, and Dance influences.  Because of this, many of the musicians I work with are either Latino or Black.  Some of the discourse used therefore contains elements of ethnic jargon and reference.  Nevertheless, aside from the ethnic flavors of speech, every band has the same type of dialogue, especially during rehearsal and a show, that would make it fairly easy to bounce from band to band without feeling lost in the interaction.  </p>
<p>Musicians are an interesting group of people to work with.  They take their skills seriously, have large egos (which is important to have as a performer), insecurities, and bad habits.  Bad habits can range from smoking and drinking to punctuality issues. One of the worst habits I have observed is probably cursing.  I remember bringing a friend of mine and her daughter to a rehearsal one time.  They had never been to one and were very excited to see what it was all about.  We walked into the studio, I introduced them to everyone, and they sat quietly in the corner anxiously waiting to hear the music.  In walks Randall, the very self -absorbed, egotistical, know- it -all guitar player. </p>
<p>“Man, some mutha fucka just cut me off!  Can you believe that bullshit!  Where the fuck is my amp cord?  Fuck!  I left it at home.  Hey Sherman, you got another one I can use? I can’t believe this shit.  I knew I shouldn’t have fuckin put it in that other bag!”</p>
<p>Needless to say, I had to do some damage control with my friend and help her understand that “harsh” language can often be a staple of the musician environment.  While it is not excusable that Randall didn’t take into account the presence of “outsiders,” there is a kind of arrogant air among a group of musicians.  They “own” wherever they happen to be, and you are in their world.  They are the masters of the musical domain, and your role is to be in awe of their talent.  I do not want to paint the picture that all musicians are rude and uncaring.  On the contrary, most are very congenial, hyper to please, and intent on making a good impression.  It’s almost as if once an “outsider” is present, a mini performance gets under way.  Most musicians want to be liked and that becomes evident.  They focus a little more, play a little more seriously, and look at the guests more frequently trying to “read” any non-verbal cue of approval.  If need be, they’ll even start with their own unique comedy acts between songs.</p>
<p>Musicians are some of the funniest people you’ll ever know.  The performer in them comes out, and they can make an excruciatingly long rehearsal or gig bearable.  With so many attention- getters present in the room, the joking can take on a life of its own.  Getting back to work often entails someone getting annoyed with the lack of progress being made, and the seriousness jolts us back to reality.  Still, you haven’t experienced humor until you have experienced it “musician style.”  Some of the funniest occasions are when they imitate other people, famous people or just other band members.  Their uncanny ability to mimic even the most subtle nuances is hilarious.  It quickly spurs others’ creativity, and the snow ball begins.  I believe it is this behind- the- scenes humor that adds to the sparkle of a performer’s performance.  It recharges the battery to be able to give more to your craft and your audience.  Besides, life as a musician isn’t always lights and glory.  It can be boring, tedious, and overwhelming.  Humor reminds us all of why we choose to do what we do.</p>
<p>One Friday night in the middle of summer, we had a gig two hours away.  Since we are all responsible to get ourselves there, there is an unspoken agreement between us that we won’t stand each other up.  Everyone has worked all week, fought traffic, and is sweating from lugging equipment into the venue.  I walk in where set-up is beginning and the “pre-gig bullshit” is in full swing.</p>
<p>“Where the hell is Gustavo?” yells Sherman.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, man. I just talked to him a little while ago.  He said he was on his way.” reassures Carroway.  Carroway rolls his eyes as Sherman walks away.  We’re all a little stressed, and no one wants Sherman’s crap right now.</p>
<p>“This is bullshit!  Alright then....whatever.  Let’s just hurry and get everything set up so we can do sound check.  If his shit sounds like shit then that’s on him”</p>
<p>“Come on, man.  Chill out.  It’s all good.  It’ll be fine.  We’re cool,” says Mario, the other vocalist.  Mario’s experience helps him be the regulating factor for Sherman.</p>
<p>Mario then breaks into his impression of a half Sinatra, half used car salesman singing “Feelings.”  Everyone cracks up laughing and barely notices Gustavo walking in.  All is well and set-up gets completed while each member makes some new joke.  Of course, Gustavo doesn’t get off that easy though.  Sherman has a few words for him.  Lucky for him, the joking has created a humorous and light ambiance so his lashing is minimal and given with playful sarcasm.</p>
<p>“Hey!  Look who decided to show up!” yells Sherman.  Visibly excited to dish out the frustration he’s been feeling.</p>
<p>“How nice of you to show up!  Did you miss the email that said 7p.m.? Don’t your Cuban numbers look the same as ours?” He is clearly enjoying the look of ‘Oh! Here it comes!’ on Gustavo’s face.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, man.  There was a lot of traffic.”  Gustavo is looking hot, haggard, and as if his fuse isn’t very long.</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah.  Isn’t it an amazing act of God that everyone else got here on time.  Did they just build a different freeway no one else knew about that you got stuck on?” Sherman continues to jab, beginning to get the hint that enough is enough.  We still have a whole night to get through together.  No one wants to make it a long one.</p>
<p>“Ha, Ha. Funny.  Shut up, man.  Get over it.  What’s next.” snaps Gustavo.  He has made it very clear that his “chastising limit” has been reached.</p>
<p>The band laughs and jokes a little more and everyone continues their conversations as if nothing has happened.</p>
<p>“Hey, Michelle!” calls Sherman.  “I brought a mic for you.  It’s over here.”</p>
<p>I walk over thinking that there is no way in hell that I am going to use someone else’s mic!  I look at his mic and am reminded that only a singer can appreciate a quality microphone, and he is definitely not a singer.</p>
<p>“Yeah…I think I’ll stick with my Beta 58A.  My highs are a lot more full sounding with mine.”  I walk away thinking about how annoying non-singers can be in a band.  </p>
<p>“Alright, Michelle.  Just thought you might wanna check it out.”</p>
<p>I try to hold my tongue, and then I blurt it out.  “Are you kidding me?  What the fuck am I supposed to do with that piece of shit?  Where did you get it? At some garage sale?”</p>
<p>“What the hell crawled up your ass?  Goddamn prissy ass singers!”</p>
<p>“Whatever!  Here, why don’t you play the bass with my son’s ukulele tonight?”</p>
<p>Sherman roles his eyes and laughs, as do I, and we go back to work.</p>
<p>An intriguing element to this community is that “shit talking” is imperative. You must be able to dish it out and take it.  There are no corporate sexual harassment rules that hang over the band’s head.  If you don’t like something, you better speak up and put someone in his/her place.  Everyone has their voice and no one puts up with anyone’s crap for long.  There is an internal checks and balances.  Different members group together on different views.  Those opposing your opinion may also jump to your defense if others are “riding” you too hard.  Sex is talked and joked about openly, and a quick-witted tongue gets you instant clout and respect.  You must be confident and sure of yourself, especially as a woman in a very male environment.  You must be comfortable in your own skin to be able to handle the comments you wouldn’t normally tolerate in any other environment. For instance, one night backstage, I was dancing around warming up trying to release some nerves.  The drummer came up to me and said, “Damn, Michelle. I didn’t know your ass could move so well.  Hmmm…why don’t you come over here and sit on papa’s lap.” </p>
<p>His mood was jovial and non-attacking so I went with it, but also put him in his place.  I said, “Carroway, I’d sit on your lap if I thought there was anything in your pants that would impress me!”</p>
<p>I smiled and walked away as everyone else howled at him for how I had “burned” him.</p>
<p>But probably the most interesting element to it all is how quickly the negative feelings can roll off and disappear once focus is placed on the music again.  It is the music that brings us home, along with all of the goals we have infused into our project. </p>
<p>All bands have certain characteristics in common.  Drive, passion, a strong sense of teamwork, and commitment are but a few.  They all must share a common vision to attain their goals.  Everything is a team effort because no one person can really do it alone, at least not in the type of venues we choose to play.  A musician can enter the “flow” by themselves, but it is the collective that makes it earth moving.  So, we have a common understanding that we need each other.  We agree that we want to be the best we can be, that we want to have a great reputation and a strong following, that we want to impact our listeners positively to be remembered, and that we are determined to make as much money possible at the best gigs available. </p>
<p>Musicians are also a very tight circle.  It is not unlikely that you could wind up working with nearly all of them on any given circuit in some way.  Therefore, your reputation and work ethic is key.  “Standard” work etiquette, however, doesn’t necessarily apply in a band in quite the same way.  In the everyday world, we would expect people to be punctual, to do their work and be ready, to look “presentable”, to speak with taste, and to respect other people’s time.  In a band, those rules quickly change.  Musicians are notorious for being late.  It is often a joke to tell the chronically late the wrong time they are expected to be somewhere in order to get them there on time.  Those musicians with a lot of experience can usually get away with not knowing the material as well as others because they can “wing it” and make it sound good no matter what happens. “Presentable” depends on where we are playing, what kind of music we are playing, and what rules a club manager may have given us.  Otherwise, it is free discretion, and beauty is then definitely in the eyes of the beholder.  As mentioned earlier, most musicians would have their mouths washed out with soap if their grandmothers ever heard them. And it isn’t unusual to have a rehearsal run an hour longer than it was supposed to because one or more members assume you are digging the grooves with them and enjoying the extended jam session.  These, however, are a small price to pay for what we receive in exchange.</p>
<p>Among musicians there is a type of brother/sisterhood.  We are an extended family.  We may not hang out together outside of gigs and rehearsals (although sometimes we may), but when we come together it is like we have never been apart.  We genuinely care about the others’ well being, and often play support group/counselors for each other’s dramas.  This bond is so strong that even if the band dissolves, if you cross paths later, you share a closeness in the newly formed band unique to the relationships of the other band members.  Others in the new band “know” that you have a friendship that runs deep, infused with the experiences only you two know about.  Even if the past was an ugly experience, and that person still bugs you, you will be there if they need someone. You will be there if they are in trouble the way you would for a sibling you fight with.  It’s a very interesting , and sometimes disturbing phenomenon.</p>
<p>“So, why put up with all of the crap?” you may be wondering.  Well, being a musician is like being on a roller coaster.  The highs are high and the lows are low, sometimes really low.  But it is the exhilaration of the speed, the freedom you feel from the wind blowing through your hair, and the butterflies that make you feel alive when you don’t know when the drop will end, that always brings you back for more.  It is hard, scary, overwhelming, and humbling.  And it is electric, fluid, powerful, and exhalting.  I get to walk out on that stage each night knowing that the audience is there to receive a gift, a gift only we can deliver in our unique way.  I get to see the smiles, impress the patrons with my talent, and draw out of people the part that dies a little each day out in the “real” world.  I get to infuse life back into people even if it is only for the length of one song.  I have found no other way to experience the ecstasy of being fully present in the moment, and at the same time lost in the space between notes.  It is truly an honor to be a part of such a community and to be such an integral part to its success.  </p>
<p>Every musician brings his/her special “something” to the mix.  It is a fine balance between experience, chemistry, leadership, and respect.  At some point, usually very early on, most bands make it very clear what kind of personalities they are seeking.  Still, with so many skilled people in one place, it is easy for things to get out of hand.  Usually, a band will work out its kinks by playing music.  It becomes very apparent early on who really knows what they are talking about.  An unspoken acknowledgment of seniority is present, and most musicians will concede to the silently constructed hierarchy.  This is not a traditional hierarchy though.  Most of the band members will have their time to lead and shine.  For instance, I am the lead vocalist.  I take my musical arrangement instruction from Sherman or Mario.  However, at a gig, I am the leader of the band.  I cue the band where I want them to go, I make suggestions to the musician designated to keep the others in check and informed, and the success of the show largely depends on me because I am the center focus of attention.  However, if I can see the crowd is really enjoying a song, I may choose to pass the hat to the guitar player for an impromptu guitar solo to extend the fun.  When this happens, my body language deflects the attention to the guitar player, and then he lets us know when he is ready to come out of his solo.  All of this passing back and forth of “leader power” goes on virtually unnoticed by the audience.  It is done with hand signals, side glances, nods, smiles, and other subtle bodily gestures. In the end, it makes for a seamless performance.  </p>
<p>While all of the gestures and cues are being relayed, we are enveloped in a musical like substance made of vibration that seems to make us all hyper sensitive to the others.  I may be happily dancing around, and then I just get a “feeling” to look back at the bass player, who then looks at me.  We make eye contact, and somehow we just know what the other is thinking.  It’s like the music has told us a keyboard solo would go great during that part of the song even though that’s not how we have rehearsed it.  We nod in agreement without saying a word, and Gustavo looks up at us right at that moment.  We smile at him, and he takes it from there.  There are nights when everything just gels, and we are left with a very euphoric, magical, intoxicating feeling.  It is this secret ingredient that, every musician will tell you, always brings them back to the music.  It’s the heart of why we do what we do.  In those moments, we are connected to a Higher Power that we don’t often experience in day to day life.  I know it all sounds very “hippish,” but it is a palpable energy one can only experience by being there.  It is a feeling that intensifies the better you get at your craft.  And it is a feeling that causes all musicians to feel a sense of camaraderie with other musicians.  Having been in that flow, you are automatically included in this secret community of others who have been there also.  And your respect is increased by being able to do your part repeatedly to access that mysterious realm.</p>
<p>The “hook” is a term used to refer to the chorus part of the song.  It is usually the part of the song most noticed and remembered by people.  The hook brings you back to where you were when you heard that song before.  The hook encapsulates the energy of the entire song.  And it lingers in your mind long after the song has ended.  When you think of the greatest hook you have ever heard, the one that immediately makes you smile whenever you hear it no matter how you’re feeling or what’s happening to you, the one that can make you see, smell, and taste where you were and who you were with when you first heard it, then you will understand why a musician always returns to the music.  It is joy in its simplest form yet so complex no words can fully describe it.  It is a longing in the heart.  It is the soul begging for freedom.  It is our essence leading us home.</p>
<p>“Ladies and gentlemen!” the DJ exclaims. “Are you ready to have a good time tonight?</p>
<p>The crowd screams in anticipation with a thirsty ‘YES!’</p>
<p>The band starts playing, I make my entrance and yell, “How’s everyone feelin tonight?”</p>
<p>The crowd screams louder.</p>
<p>Not satisfied with the intensity of the crowd, I yell again, “No, no, no! I said, ‘How’s everyone feelin tonight?’”</p>
<p>The crowd cheers with a vibration that lets me know they are ready.  I raise my hand and cue the band, feeling the pre-gig jitters flowing away as my attention becomes the audience.  I begin to dance and sing and feel myself beginning to descend like someone just leaping out of an airplane to skydive.  There is no turning back.  It’s all or nothing.  I am smiling as the rush of the “flow” begins to permeate me, and together, we are home.</p>
