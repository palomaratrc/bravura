<center><b>Severance</b><br>
By Carmela Zermeno</center><br><br>

<p>The women emerged, throwing the tent flap aside as if suffocated, breathing the ripe night air and started walking with no intended end in mind, wanting to spin the tired problems inside; hell bent on the solution driving her constant forward movement with determination and burning like the blazing bonfires, treading over man-made trails, passing by cooler meadows; at first staying by the roadside for fear of being lost or wanting to stay lost, and scarcely noticing when the landscape changed from underneath her tread; the absence of echo as she stepped and eyes adjusting naturally to the dim surroundings, forgetting flashlights, relying on extravagant moonlight to lead the way, onward through the trees to the edge of the water where the river resounds the World’s breath signaling all is well though parts are cast in darkness; meanwhile, a lull of silence lures the blind into security creating illusions of isolation . . .  until a rustling breaks the links of contemplation and the curtain lifts, jogging the women’s memory to the rivers edge where she glances disoriented, eyes squinting, struggling to make out shapes shifting just ahead, crouching on all fours on an impulse to blend in and hears a request for recognition in the form of a long and solemn howl, piercing the darkness so absolutely, no doubt all heard what it said, including the women who invading the ritual felt her blood coil with primordial spasms, dropping further to the Earths’ welcoming breast, throwing back her tangled mane and rejecting her doomed species returns the call with strength, forgetting all ties and pain.</p>
