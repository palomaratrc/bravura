<center><b>Why You Can’t Win</b><br>
By Rochelle Miller</center><br><br>

<p>“Hello son. Sorry about that, we had to shut the front doors early.  Had these yanks in, see. Tourists” as he said the word Harry took his eyes on an excursion around their sockets “had to get rid of them.” </p>
<p>Charlie smiled, amused at how Harry never let business get in the way of a little xenophobia. “That’s alright, I figured you were all still in here, what with the lights being on and all.”  Despite the blazing lighting, the little, backstreet pub in London’s East End could never throw off the dingy gloom that Charlie felt it to be shrouded in.</p>
<p>“Suppose you’re looking for your old man. He’s through there,” Harry said, motioning to another room in the pub, partitioned by a grubby red and gold crested curtain. “He’ll be plotting the next revolution no doubt”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, what is it this week? Workers Unite or United Workers?” Charlie sighed.     “It’s alright; I’ll let him find me.  I’ll have a pint please Harry and whatever you’re trying to pass off as a sandwich these days.”  Charlie took a place at the bar and lit up a cigarette.</p>
<p>“Bloody rude, just like you father,” Harry muttered taking the comment in the spirit that it was given in.  He picked up what was to be Charlie’s pint glass and started wiping the thumbprints off it. “So, we haven’t seen you in here for a while Doc, how’s it going?” </p>
<p>Charlie shrugged “Oh you know, been better.” There was a silence while Charlie tried to think of something else to say. “Here, I heard about the darts league controversy.” </p>
<p>“Bloody cheats” Harry began animatedly “they had a girl, a girl! Would you believe it? Don’t get me wrong I’m all for women playing darts, in fact we’ve got a women’s league here; the Missus is the captain; but it’s not right them mixing it up like that.  She never should have been playing and we’ve written to the association, stating as much”</p>
<p>“Too right too” Charlie said, feigning outrage. </p>
<p>Harry disappeared around the back area of the bar to see what ingredients he could resurrect for a sandwich. From across the bar Charlie noticed Sally Fisher sitting with two other women he didn’t recognize.  He’d gone to school with Sally and had once kissed her at a bus stop outside the Hackney Empire while waiting for the 277 to Stepney.  She caught him staring at her, smiled and gave a wave. He smiled back and winked.  It was an awkward wink, he felt, one that could have easily been misconstrued and he questioned whether or not he should pretend to have something in his eye.  He decided there and then that he was definitely not a winker and vowed never to attempt it again.  One of the other women said something and Sally threw her head back and laughed.  “Blimey” Charlie thought to himself as he suddenly remembered that laugh and the central reason the relationship never ventured as far as Stepney.  He toyed with the idea of going over to her and starting up a conversation but he couldn’t think of anything to say so he just sat at the bar and drank his pint. </p>
<p>“I thought these days you only drank at those trendy wine bars with all your Doctor friends” a gruff voice said from behind him. </p>
<p>Charlie swiveled around to face his father.   </p>
<p>“Hello Dad” </p>
<p>“So what have we done to deserve this honor?”  </p>
<p>“Leave it out will you dad.” This whole approach irritated Charlie.  With all the zeal of a parent living vicariously through their child, Charlie’s father had pushed Charlie to “get out and make something of himself.”  This idiom however had since been replaced by the indefensible: “so you think you’re too good for us, do you?”  </p>
<p>His father saw the cigarette and became agitated. </p>
<p>“You said you quit. You trying to kill yourself son?” </p>
<p>Harry placed down on the bar something resembling a toasted cheese and ham sandwich.</p>
<p>“Oh I see you really are trying to kill yourself.” Charlie’s dad choked and looked up.    </p>
<p>“Here Harry, when you’ve finished murdering my son I’ll have another pint.” </p>
<p>“If you were my old man I’d want to kill myself and all” Harry fired back in retaliation. Charlie’s father grunted and returned to the subject of the cigarette. </p>
<p>“I mean it son, it’s not right you smoking, what with you being a Doctor and all.”</p>
<p>As a rule Charlie’s father supported most forms of debauchery, however he had never approved of smoking and as a teenager Charlie had found it was really the only form of rebellion he could take.  </p>
<p>“So despite the death wish everything else alright? Charlie’s father inquired “Samantha and the boys alright?” </p>
<p>Charlie decided not to tell his father right away </p>
<p>“Yeah, not bad, you know how it is, same old, same old.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been meaning to ring and let you know old Vince Sims died.” His father started.  Charlie was always getting phone calls from his father to inform him of somebody’s death.  It was, Charlie imagined, a guilt tactic on his father’s part; punishment for Charlie not visiting as often as he should.  It was near impossible though to drive across London from where he lived and Samantha never wanted to take public transport, she flatly refused to use the underground.  As it happened, Samantha didn’t like to be reminded of where Charlie came from which was why she also objected to the way he spoke.  His patients and colleagues weren’t enamored either with the accent and Charlie had done his best over the years to refine it.  </p>
<p>“Oh right, sorry to hear that Dad”</p>
<p>“You don’t even remember him do you?”</p>
<p>“Course I do, owned the fish mongers before it became an Internet café.”</p>
<p>“You delivered his grandson when you were a medical student at Barnet General. I remember he gave me a bloody great salmon the next day”</p>
<p>“Why did he give you a salmon?” Charlie asked.  </p>
<p>“Charlie! The man’s dead” His father said impatiently.</p>
<p>“I’m just saying, I delivered the kid, surely he should have given me the salmon.”  Although Charlie was joking about the salmon, on some small level, without knowing the reason why, it bothered him. </p>
<p>His father took a dramatic sigh. “Died of cancer, he did, another one gone.” He paused for effect and then raised his pint. “To Vince” he said with gravitas. </p>
<p>Charlie felt obliged to do the same but cringed a little from the sentiment.  There was a brief moment of silence for Vince.  Charlie thought about the salmon.  The silence lasted until his father decided Vince had received enough respect, not forgetting the man had died owing him a fiver. </p>
<p>“Your brother’s bought a new van, nice it is. The old one was knackered.”</p>
<p>Charlie’s father and brother were in the business of putting roofs on houses. The thin yellow headed invoice paper read “Briggs and Son” in big bold black letters. Having long since been restricted from going up ladders his father stayed on at work in what he saw as a consultancy role. It had always struck Charlie as ironic that it should have been his father’s neglect of the family home’s roof that had fueled the ongoing bitter rows between his parents for almost a decade. It was, in fact, the subject, of their very final argument before his mother walked out and moved in with a retired policeman from Dagenham.  </p>
<p>“You should see this new one, nice it is, it’s got leather interior. Ain’t, never bought a brand new van before.”</p>
<p>Charlie suppressed the urge to correct his father’s double negative in the same way he might correct his sons. “Yeah? Sweet.”  He said trying to sound enthusiastic.</p>
<p>His father discussed the van and then moved on to how the government was screwing up the war and the national health system and the local social club’s outing to Blackpool.</p>
<p>After exhausting politics his father exclaimed, “Course your brother’s the worry now. He’s going to have to put some effort in if he plans to make a go of it with the business, the roofing trade ain’t what it used to be, but you know Dave, he ain’t got no get up and go.  Still you’re okay, least there’ll always be sick people, right?”</p>
<p>Charlie nodded.  He decided not to tell his father tonight.  Maybe things weren’t final yet, maybe he wouldn’t need to.</p>
<p>“Well I’ve got to push off” Charlie said pretending to be conscious of the time.  He got up and for a moment glanced over at Sally Fisher with her friends.  They were all laughing now.</p>
<p>His dad sighed. “I’ll expect to see you in the next millennium then.  You know it wouldn’t kill you to pick up the phone on occasion.”  </p>
<p>“Yeah alright.” Charlie groaned “I’ll see you soon Dad” and then he shouted over his father’s head “Be seeing you Harry.”</p>
<p>“By son, here, you hardly touched your sandwich.” Harry replied, looking slightly forlorn.</p>
<p>Charlie walked out the back door of the pub towards Bethnal Green tube station.  A familiar figure approaching him called out.</p>
<p>“Alright mate.” It was his brother “How’s it going?”</p>
<p>“Not bad, you?”</p>
<p>“Well we finally got the kids off to sleep. I’m gasping for a pint. Is Dad in there?”</p>
<p>“Where else? You’ll have to go around the back though, Harry’s locked the front doors.”</p>
<p>“Right-y-o. Samantha and the kids alright?”</p>
<p>“Not really mate, we’re going through one of those “trial separations?”  Charlie offered Dave the opportunity to tell his father on his behalf.</p>
<p>“Well not to worry – you’ll sort it out – you two are meant for each other.  You and her should come over one day. I’ll take all the kids out in the new van.”  He extended the offer with the ease that people do when they know that an actual visit is unfeasible. </p>
<p>“Yeah, we’ll do that” Charlie accepted, going along with the pretense.  “Dad told me about the new van.  Congratulations.”</p>
<p>“Yeah cheers.” Dave said and then continued thoughtfully, “Don’t take this the wrong way mate but I wish you hadn’t shown up tonight.  I could do without this particular week being full of “Charlie this” and “Charlie that” and “why couldn’t you have been a doctor Dave?”  You know what he’s like. You can’t ever win with Dad can you? Anyway I better let you get off.”</p>
<p>“Yeah okay, bye Dave, take care.”  As Charlie walked down the steps to the underground station he played Dave’s words over and over again in his head “You’re right Dave” he thought to himself “You can’t ever win with Dad.”</p>
