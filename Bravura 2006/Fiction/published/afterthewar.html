<center><b>After the War</b><br>
<i>Third Place Winner, Fiction</i><br>
By Don Oestreicher<br><br></center>


<center>1957</center><br><br>

<p>On the day of the funeral, my mother left me with grandma.  We sat in the kitchen by a cold fireplace.  Grandma stared out the window as the long black cars disappeared into the fog.  I tried to sketch a picture of my father, but he also faded into the fog.  I could barely hear her, “I remember World War II … men at war … women in factories … your papa comes home … his wife  …  not a wife anymore … she doesn’t see it.”  I listened, but she wasn’t talking to me.<br><br></p>

<center>1950</center><br><br>

<p>My mother sat in our green Plymouth, like a queen in her royal coach, “In the car; now! Look at the sun; we’ll be stuck in the tunnel.”  </p>
<p>I looked at the sun; it was over the rooftops and almost down to the street.  She opened a map over the skirts of her navy and white striped dress and twisted her arms across her chest.  Her lips closed to a straight line as she leaned back on her cornflake-colored curls.  I watched a line of ants march up and down the oak tree in front of our building.  My mother looked past me, “I’m ready.”</p>
<p>No one argued with my mother.  My brother Jimmy and I scrambled into the back seat, with my favorite Dr. Seuss book, And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, Jimmy’s sack of toys, and an A&P grocery bag containing fried chicken and a loaf of Wonder bread from grandma, “For the long trip.” </p>
<p>Jimmy grabbed a bear and a plastic tree from his sack, “New house, let’s go. Trees and bears and tigers.”  </p>
<p>I looked at the pictures in my book.</p>
<p>The car doors closed with a thud; dad pulled out the choke.  With a roar and puff of black smoke, the car rolled down the hill out of Newark.  He wore a brown suit with wide lapels, a white shirt, and a striped tie, loose at the neck.  Sweat dripped off his bald head.  He unfolded a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped the sweat off his nearly invisible eyebrows and the slightly upturned corners of his mouth.  He shifted into third gear as we crossed the marsh to Hoboken.  </p>
<p>My mother silently stared at her map.</p>
<p>Jimmy bounced up and down, “Birds, big white birds.”  </p>
<p>Grabbing the opportunity to teach, my mother corrected him without looking up from her map, “Herons, those are herons.  Harry look at the Herons.”  </p>
<p>I dutifully looked at the white birds with long bills and longer legs.</p>
<p>A little later, my mother spoke again, “See the sign?  Holland Tunnel, straight ahead; get in the left lane.” </p>
<p>My dad put his hand out the window, signaled, and slowly returned it to the steering wheel.  </p>
<p>Now it was Jimmy’s turn, “Tunnel, honk the horn!”  </p>
<p>Our car was silent, but several other cars and one truck responded to his request.  </p>
<p>“Williamsburgh Bridge, to the right; watch out!”  </p>
<p>My dad hit the brakes to let a delivery truck pass and headed over the bridge.  </p>
<p>“Didn’t you see that truck coming?”</p>
<p>My dad didn’t answer, but Jimmy jumped in, “Horses; look at the horses!”</p>
<p>I looked at the pictures of Mulberry Street, Horses on Mulberry Street; what about the new house?</p>
<p>Brooklyn looked and smelled a lot like Newark, a few big old trees, lots of big buildings.  Yellow bricks, red bricks, brown bricks, all covered with black soot from trains and ships and cars.  The sharp city smells burned my eyes.  </p>
<p>Jimmy’s head bobbed back and forth, “Look at those funny men with long hair and black hats.”  </p>
<p>My mother replied, “Those are Jews.  Harry, look at the Jews.”</p>
<p>After a while, we passed cemeteries, “Look!  Look!  Gravestones, ghosts,” and then potato fields, “Tractors – look at the tractors!”</p>
<p>Among the fields were new houses and more new houses – finally Middle Lane.  It looked nothing like Mulberry Street, not even one horse or cart, just rows of small houses, tiny twig trees, and dirt where grass should have been.</p>
<p>The car stopped.  I took my dad’s hand and walked through the dirt and scrap lumber and broken shingles to the front door.  He opened the door, and we all stepped back to let my mother walk in first.  The front door opened directly into the kitchen. Mommy can sit by the brick fireplace and watch me play in the front yard.</p>
<p>I admired the modern kitchen, all white, all steel – the latest everything – white-enameled steel – cabinets, counters, sink, refrigerator, stove, even a dishwasher and a washing machine.  I imagined my mother would be so proud make meals and do the laundry here.  She would be a homemaker, just like the nice mommies with big skirts on television.  Mommy, I promise to be good like those boys on television.<br><br></p>

<p>“I saw the red ball at the pond; there’s skating today.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t even Christmas and the pond was already frozen.  I pulled my blue snow suit over my brown corduroy pants.  My red mittens hung by strings through my jacket sleeves.  I grabbed my hat and skates and ran to the car.</p>
<p>Dad started to car to “heat up the engine.”</p>
<p>My mother, with wool pants under her dress, carried Jimmy’s skates along with her own, “Let’s get going before it gets too crowded.”</p>
<p>Jimmy dived into the snow to make a snow angel, “Angel, angel,” but mother stared at him from the car with her arms crossed, so he ran into the back seat and slammed the door.</p>
<p>I dropped my skates and shoved him, “Jimmy, you got snow all over me!”</p>
<p>“Sorry, sorry, didn’t see you.”</p>
<p>When we got to the pond, dad and I glided away while my mother was still lacing Jimmy’s skates by the fire.</p>
<p>“Dad, at school…”</p>
<p>He leaned towards me as we made a big turn around the shallow end of the pond.  The sun was bright, but we together made just a single shadow before the sun disappeared behind the pine trees.</p>
<p>“Dad, I don’t know what to do…”</p>
<p>He looked deep into my eyes as we skated along the line of trees.  It smelled like Christmas.</p>
<p>“Do about what?”</p>
<p>“Everything; everybody; I’m so different; just lost.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry; when the time comes, you’ll know what to do.”</p>
<p>He made a sharp turn in front of a “thin ice” sign, but when I tried, I fell and slid past it.  He sprayed ice in the air and skated back to the sign.</p>
<p>The pond creaked.  Tiny cracks and rising water surrounded me.</p>
<p>“Careful. Don’t get up,” my dad warned from the safe side of the sign. </p>
<p>The pond crackled and I felt the cold water against my bare skin.  I looked at my dad, but the sun reflected off his glasses and I couldn’t see his eyes.</p>
<p>I stretched my wet legs and dug the tips of my skates into the soft ice and slid myself towards the reflected sunlight.  When I reached the sign, he helped me up and we skated towards the fire.</p>
<p>“I know how you feel.”</p>
<p>My dad took my hand and spun me in a tight circle.  Around and around I went.  Water sprayed off me in all directions while my talk talked.</p>
<p>“During the war … in France … alone and scared … but when the charge came … I knew … I knew what to do … I became invisible.”</p>
<p>He let go and whipped me across the ice towards the fire.  </p>
<p>“Look how fast I’m going!”</p>
<p>He watched me and I glided all the way back to the shore.</p>
<p>Jimmy was skating circles around my mother.</p>
<p>“Where did you go?  I saw your father, but you were no where to be seen.”</p>
<p>“I fell.  Mom, I just fell.”</p>
<p>Dad smiled at me and we took off for another lap around the pond.<br><br></p>

<center>1955</center><br><br></p>

<p>My mother was never a television homemaker – no fancy meals, no cute canisters, nor dainty towels, or even needlework proclaiming “Home Sweet Home.” </p>
<p>She lectured, “Simple meals, scientifically healthy, and efficient.”</p>
<p>She never covered the counters with mixing bowls or the stove with pots and pans.  Breakfast?  Eggs in the cast-iron skillet, bread in the toaster.  Dinner?  A can opener and a roasting pan did the trick.  Chicken was just chicken. Potatoes were just potatoes.  Two spices lived in her cabinets – oregano and basil – safe and secure – she rarely used them.</p>
<p>When I came home from school, if mother was even home, she was in the kitchen reading Greek tragedies or Freud or Sartre.  Why is she telling me about a boy who kills his father and marries his mother?  The kitchen was where she did her homework; she was a college student. </p>
<p>After school I disappeared around the fireplace that separated the kitchen from the living room to watch television.  The living room television, the latest from RCA, twelve inches, black and white, came with the house, built into the wall, under the stairs.</p>
<p>The living room was big.  The back wall was all glass.  I remember my dad, bare-chested and sweating, working with the carpenters to expand the living room, pushing the “picture window” ten feet into the backyard.  I helped.  I liked to help my dad; we also built two large sofas from surplus picnic tables.</p>
<p>I remember a day Jimmy was watching his stupid puppet show.  I changed the station, “It’s Howdy Doody Time!”</p>
<p>He jumped on me, “Kukla, Fran, and Ollie!”</p>
<p>I curled up in a ball, “No, Buffalo Bob!”</p>
<p>My dad had come home early and he interrupted us, “Stop that, mommy’s doing her homework.”  </p>
<p>He looked at me, “Let’s play soccer!”  </p>
<p>I happily to left Jimmy watching his puppets, while dad and I played in the backyard.  </p>
<p>“Hurry up dad, I’m going to score!”  </p>
<p>I turned around to see how close he’s getting, but he’s on the ground, holding his chest and making a strange noise, “e-e-ee,” like when my cat died. </p>
<p>“Daddy, daddy, get up!”  </p>
<p>He doesn’t answer; he just shakes.  I run into the house, “Mommy, mommy!”  </p>
<p>Two men in white uniforms, like Good Humor ice cream men, put him on an army stretcher and took him to Meadowbrook Hospital.  My mother went to see him everyday, but I wasn’t allowed until Sunday.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning a dark thunderhead followed us to the hospital.  We walked down the long windowless halls where polio victims packaged in iron lungs watched us in their little mirrors.  We saw children with uneaten ice cream.</p>
<p>“Why don’t they eat their ice cream?” I wondered out loud.</p>
<p>“They had their tonsil removed; their throats are too sore,” my mother explained.</p>
<p>“Too sore to eat ice cream?  Never,” Jimmy asserted.</p>
<p>My dad’s room had four beds, each hidden behind a white curtain.  All the men had heart attacks.</p>
<p>When he came home, he had to “take it easy.”  He reclined on the sofa and spoke softly into a Dictaphone machine.  We watched me build bridges with my Erector Set, but no more “Harry, let’s play soccer.”  No more, “Harry, let’s skate around the pond.”  I feared “No more daddy.”<br><br></p>

<center>Summer</center><br><br></p>

<p>It was the summer before fourth grade, the first Saturday after July Fourth.  No air conditioning, all the neighborhood kids played outside, running through the sprinklers, playing tag, hop scotch, stick ball, or jump rope.  The summer sun made the colors vibrant, the greenest grass, the bluest sky and the blackest streets.  It was hot with only a few fluffy clouds, no chance of a thunder storm, though the summer weather changed quickly.</p>
<p>All the kids feared George with his curly red hair and terrifying smile.  He was a head taller than the rest of us and always ready to steal homework, ice cream, places in line or seats on the swing – just so no one forgot him.</p>
<p>They admired John, a thin boy who breathed through his mouth and whose dad, still in the Army, home from Korea, cut his hair every weekend.  He could hit a baseball a mile and was always the team captain; his team always won.  If George threatened him, John kicked him in the shins and ran so fast he couldn’t be caught, but that didn’t happen often.</p>
<p>I think they also admired Bill, a fat kid with glasses who sat in the front of the classroom, but never raised his hand, even though everyone knew he had all the answers, even the teachers.  He knew the capital of South Dakota, twelve times eight, and how to spell “phonograph.”  He was in my class for third grade, but next year he’s went into fifth.  No one talked to him, but they all knew he was the “brain.”  No one chose Bill for their team; he just sat and read.  George never stole his book.  </p>
<p>No one recognized me.  My teachers wrote on my report card, “He isn’t any trouble, but he doesn’t seem interested,” and “Average intelligence when he applies himself.”  George picked on me when he was bored.  John picked me last.  Bill didn’t know my name.  I was the invisible boy.<br><br></p>

<center>That Afternoon</center><br><br></p>

<p>My mother turned off the sprinklers after lunch so we didn’t get stomach cramps.  With bellies full of peanut butter and jellies, baloney sandwiches, and milk, we sat on the curb and talked about Howdy Doody and the Yankees.  The girls talked about Princess Summerfall Winterspring, “She’s so cool.”  </p>
<p><p>George kicked one of the girls, “She’s square just like you.”  </p>
<p>“I want to be like Mickey Mantle,” John mused.  George kicked him too.</p>
<p>A cool breeze blew us to our feet.  Thunder clouds infiltrated the neighborhood. Darkness covered the purple pansies and red petunias, but before they hid their faces, the invading clouds retreated and the sunlight returned.</p>
<p>This wasn’t a day to trust the weather.  Dark clouds soon returned, the flowers took cover, and the wind whistled through the trees.  Flash!  Lightening!  I retreated to my porch, sat by the open door on the hot concrete steps and waited for the thunder.</p>
<p>One cloud took up patrol over Middle Lane cloaking my yard in darkness.  A fight started and I stood up to see what’s going on.</p>
<p>“Stop!”  “Hit him!”  “Fight!”  </p>
<p>I saw George in the center, but I couldn’t see his target.  It could’ve been anyone.</p>
<p>Inside the house, my dad’s weak voice asked, “Dottie, what’s going on?  Is Harry okay?  Is Jimmy okay?”</p>
<p>I turned to the door, but before I could answer, my mother replied, “Fine, the kids’ll quiet down in a minute,” without bothering to look up from her books</p>
<p>I looked back to the fight.  </p>
<p>“Quit it!”  “Again!”  “Nooo!”  </p>
<p>George was picking on one of the little kids.	</p>
<p>My father yelled, “Dottie!” </p>
<p>Then he gasped and coughed and I heard the Dictaphone hit the floor.  My mother didn’t say anything, but slammed her book and headed in my direction. </p>
<p>Caught between my mother and George, I moved towards the knot of children on the front lawn.  I was near to the fight when she opened the door.  	</p>
<p>Just when I could see what was going on she screamed, “Harry, over here!”</p>
<p>I turned around, “But, mom…”</p>
<p>“NOW!”</p>
<p>“But mom, can’t you see…”</p>
<p>That’s her limit. She takes two long steps and grabs my ear and drags me into the house.  “Upstairs,” she demands.  No one argues with my mother.</p>
<p>Upstairs I go, around the fireplace, through the living room, up the stairs, over the built-in television, to my room in the attic.</p>
<p>I don’t know what to do.  I don’t want to go to my room.  At the top of the stairs, I tuck in my arms and legs and hide between the steps and the trap door.  I don’t fit.  The door cracks open.  The attic coughs a haze of dirt and dust; I sneeze.  The door bounces up and drops against my back.  </p>
<p>At the bottom of the stairs, dad struggles holding the banister with both hands, “I see you there.”</p>
<p>He makes a noise halfway between a cough and a laugh, “You can’t hide from me. What’s going on out there?”</p>
<p>I’m afraid he’s having another attack, “Nothing dad, nothing,” </p>
<p>I rolled under the door and crawled into my room.  The roof rafters went right down to the bare wood floor.  My mattress, one side against the roof, covered most of the floor.  Tinker Toy castles, Lincoln Log forts, green plastic soldiers, and an assortment of tanks and ships built from pieces of scrap lumber cluttered the rest.</p>
<p>My desk, under the only window, supported paint jars, brushes, and bowls of water, some with fuzzy white stuff growing in them.  The chair, in the middle of the room, connected to a web of pretend phone and power lines strung across the roof beams.  My mother didn’t come up here any more.</p>
<p>The roof and walls were painted with rocket ships and fast trains and hung with plastic models of fighter jets.  Two big quilts were bunched on my bed – a hand-me-down from my grandma with violet lilacs and pink daisies and a cotton one with a brickwork pattern.  The colors were pastel, but at least they were bricks.</p>
<p>I fell down on my mattress, wrapped myself in the bricks and rolled against the roof.  I stared at dark clouds, My mother’s mad; my dad’s sick.  It’s up to me.  Wetness dripped down my cheeks, Tears?  Never! I wiped the sweat off my face with the soft quilt.</p>
<p>Crash, a rock flies through the window.  Glass pieces chime against the paint jars and splash into a bowl of water.  The rock bounces and takes out two platoons of soldiers and a Lincoln Log fort, before a two-by-four tank stops it. </p>
<p>A cold breeze chills the room and George yells, “Hey momma’s boy, we still got him.”  </p>
<p>“Him” is my brother Jimmy.  I don’t get up. I hug the bricks around me.  What can I do – stuck in the attic, sick dad, mad mother, and George has Jimmy?</p>
<p>I crack open the trapdoor, “Mom?”</p>
<p>My dad’s weak voice answers, “Can’t you see your mother’s busy.”</p>
<p>Shaking, I walk to the window, “George, please…”</p>
<p>Everyone looks up.  George laughs.  They all laugh, even Bill, everyone except Jimmy.  His arm is at a terrible angle twisted behind his back and his dirty face, streaked with muddy stripes, looks up.  If I were really invisible, I could get George.</p>
<p>I collapsed on the bed and wrapped myself in the quilt.  I was twisted and knotted in my brick wall; my quilt was strangling me.  I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t move.  The more I struggled, the tighter it got.</p>
<p>I fight to breathe and move my trapped arms; the quilt splits.  I gasp the fresh air.  Panting, I flip the trapdoor out of my way and run down the stairs, three at a time; the door slams shut barely missing my head.</p>
<p>My dad drops his Dictaphone, but I’m in the kitchen before it hits the floor.  I hear him wheeze, “Remember France … you’ll know … you’ll know what to do.”</p>
<p>Mom doesn’t have time to slam her book before I disappear outside, running through the flowers, around the house.</p>
<p>Dark clouds and tears blind me.  Each step sinks deeply into the soft flower bed, pansies and petunias explode in every direction like red, yellow and purple fireworks.  I fly over the azaleas like a jet fighter.</p>
<p>I look up and there is George.  Lightning flashes and I can see every curly red hair.  Crash.  Thunder.  I look at him, mouth open wide, big teeth, two fists; he lets Jimmy go.</p>
<p>I make a flying tackle and knock George to the ground.  Jimmy scrambles away.  George and I roll in the grass, my hands frozen around his legs.  My eyes flash all around, everyone backs away.  Bill looks scared, but John is smiling.  </p>
<p>I jump to my feet and look down at a dazed George.  His eyes seem to say, “Who are you?  Where did you come from?”  I feel a need to apologize, to explain, to say something.  All I can say is, “I said, ‘please.’” </p>
<p>I run home victorious.  I’ve beaten George.<br><br></p>

<center>Afterwards</center><br><br></p>

<p>I run through the front door.  My mother is holding Jimmy and wiping his face with her skirt.  When she sees me, she puts her finger across her lips, “Shush.  You’re father is resting.”</p>
<p>Jimmy looks at me and moves his lips, “Thanks.”</p>
<p>She runs her fingers through his hair, and as if she’s surprised to still see me, she adds, “and I thought I told you to go to your room.”</p>
<p>After that day, George was still a bully. John was still a great athlete.  Bill was still the brain, and I was invisible, just like my dad.  Nothing was the same.</p>
