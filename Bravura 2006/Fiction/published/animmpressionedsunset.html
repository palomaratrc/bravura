<center><b>Impressioned Sunset</b><br>
By Bryon Spencer</center><br><br>

<p>“I forget things. Sometimes I get lost and don’t remember where I am, or what I am doing, was doing. What’s clear one minute is changed the next.” I tell her this and she turns away.</p>
<p>Fiery clouds are the whisking strokes of a masterpiece of some dead French Impressionist; a sun set, reflecting from the water, silhouette her naked breasts, her legs through her fading black linen skirt, blowing with the wind in a blood orange sky, like a tempting goddess, a seductress. She balances herself over the railing on the edge of the bow trying to see the hull under where she’s hanging. She slips, almost falls but recaptures her balance her sense of reality and stares out to a seemingly empty horizon. She turns to look into my eyes as she tucks that black hair, just long enough to be blown in her face, back behind her ears.</p>
<p>“You’re beautiful. You know that right?”</p>
<p>She smiles a smile that brings back years of my life. </p>
<p>I grab her around the waist to pull her closer so she’s rubbing up against me, and I can feel her warmth, her razor sharp legs wrapped around me, those beautiful breasts sandwiched between us. </p>
<p>“How do you like it, baby?” She asks.</p>
<p>I kiss her and she takes me by the hand to lead me down to in the cabin where she pulls me over her. She wraps her thighs around me and puts me inside her. We make love on silken sheets, lust.</p>
<p> “I love you,” I tell her as I whisper to her through the silencer of my gun. I embrace her till she goes limp and everything grows dark. The sun has fully set.</p>
<p>We would sail south, along the coast and turn out west at Dana Point, set anchor in the depths of Emerald Bay at Catalina. We’d usually try and arrive after dark, because she always said that the dark was more romantic, but we’d always arrive early. On the first night we’d celebrate. We’d make excuses to drink Gin and Champagne while sitting on the deck after taking down the sail. There was nothing but the lights over Newport in the distance fading into the black starred night, and the soft flame of the lantern glowing her eyes. The moon’s a long white streak just peaking over the horizon, reflecting off the current, beautiful and unforgivingly forgettable. I never took my eyes off her once as she’d continue to drink and leave cherry lips on the glass.</p>
<p>She’d go skinny dipping off the Indian reef at sundown, the moment after dusk, and sometimes in the morning. I would always get at her about not being shy. But she loved being nude, I loved her nude. Out on the water she was free, no bonds that needed to be cut. Afterwards, she’d dry off and we’d make love. She was never happier than when we were here. I never had as much esteem as she did, that much I remember.</p>
<p><p>I light a cigarette, and try to relax. She comes up from behind me and starts rubbing my shoulders, but it’s soft and doesn’t help. I pull her arm down and she swings around onto my lap, legs in the air. They’re long and tight and I caress them. She laughs the way she does when I get to the crease behind the knee. I tell her she’s beautiful. She gives me a kiss on the cheek and pulls herself up off my lap, she strips.</p>
<p>She pulls me by the arm and tells me to go in the water with her.</p>
<p>I tell her I don’t feel like swimming. She pushes her lower lip out throws me back down into my chair then dives in. She swims around astern for a few minutes and infrequently eyeing me. The echo of a directed whistle comes across the harbor, the one other boat. Not to smart. I get out my specks and see he’s mirroring me. I fetch her out of the cabin and hope he’s still watching. Six shots echo back at his hull; He won’t stick around for her dip tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>I lean over the rail so I can see her. I tell her she was asking for trouble. She tells me that’s why I have her and pulls herself up the step ladder to rings out her thick curls. I toss her a towel and she taps herself and rubs those beautiful long legs of hers down. Sipping whiskey, I stare at her as if she were being paid to satisfy me, a stripper, smug.</p>
<p>The rocking of ocean currents, once hypnotically peaceful, break on the hull, convincing me to open my eyes to watch her, watch her dream. The toile sheets, the sheets she picked out, are empty to my surprise and I know she won’t be coming back. I close my eyes again, pretend she were here, watching that smile she’d finally show only while in peace. I imagine her draped over me, head resting comfortably on my chest, but I know it’s not real and she vanishes in a cloud of smoke. I pull myself out of bed, but I’m not yet awake.</p>
<p>The morning is unsteadily calm. The fog is thick in a salt air, a diffusioned grey haze. I check the boat. I call out for her, thinking she’s gone dipping. She doesn’t call back, silence. She’s inexistent, a ghost, the whisper of a lie. I’m a lonely soul, confined over a directionless sea to the confines of forty length rails, stranded.</p>
<p>I pour a cup and rifle through the stacks loose papers until I come across one, thrown over the galley table. After three years, I pick up the pen up, and I put my signature where it was needed. It’s official, the divorce papers, she got what she wanted. Cream swirls and vanishes in a hallucinated carnation over the first cup of coffee. Starting off the day, trying, keeping my mind off of what have might happened, what should have happened. </p>
<p>She tried to make it work for me, tried taking care of everything, all the paperwork. After she was gone, I tried to make sense of what everything was, but I would get turned around, confused. I come across a red leather bound notebook. Boater’s registration, boater’s license, California State Driver’s License, and a stack of checks; the boater’s wallet. I don’t recognize the name on the registration. </p>
<p>We bought the Impressioned Sunset, that’s what its name was then, a couple years back. We’d been seeing each other off and on for about ten years. She thought I was loosing it, she almost left me because of the boat. She thought it was a complete waste of our money and our future, little did she know. She’d never even been over water before that first trip, but she fell in love with it instantly. I think it was the city lights she loved to escape from, the sirens you could set your watch to. </p>
<p>I asked her to marry me on that first trip. It had been awhile since I’d ever captained a sail, probably since I was a kid. It took us five days to go from the city down the coast. I remember her expression the first time she saw dolphins skimming alongside the bow. It was the first time, in all those years, all those moments lost, I’d every truly seen her happy in her troubled life. We sailed into Avalon, it was between sobriety over a bottle of Smirnoff.</p>
<p>It hits me like a bullet through the stomach, an aching pierce through torn skin. I try to not think about my insides eating themselves away, but it’s too much, I need food. I rummage through all the cupboards in the galley. I rip through and slam the cupboards off their hinges; frantic, furiously bloodlust, like taking a hit of pure adrenaline. Everything starts to go dark and I put my fist through the glass of the microwave to catch myself. </p>
<p>There was an incident, the beginning of the end to her tragedy. She had disappointing eyes, a look of a victim of dread. She was staring at me from the back of a train, the whistle blows. I try keep running after her, but my legs don’t work. She blows me a kiss and the car vanishes into the horizon and everything goes black.</p>
<p>The faucet, in the head, runs blood as it passes my fist. The blood is warm, steaming down my arm. I push aside all the bottles of medication I should be taking to find something to wrap it up with. My fingers grow stiff the tighter I wrap the gauges. As soon as I finish, the faucet starts spitting and goes dry, a death sentence. Water, the essence of life of death, what I have more than I need and deprived of. The reservoir must be nearly empty.</p>
<p>Hours pass and the days drag at sea. Pull out a Black, indulge its scent, light. There’s no food, and the water reservoir’s getting low, I have less than a low pressure three minute shower’s worth. I crank anchor, not that it will do much in a dead sea, but the slow repetition of piling chains have to keep my mind occupied, from who she, the woman you knew the night before. </p>
<p>It was four nights ago when I picked her up. She had just gotten off work, and I was just another asshole, just there for a peep show, but I made company unnoticed. She knew all about me, spared me some pity. She asked me if I had someplace we could go, someplace private. She’d flirted with me in the past; giving me an extra drink here and there, don’t lie. The only way I could get her to notice me was to spot her a grand; otherwise you’re just another pervert. 	</p>
<p>I wait until she gets off, and I stick to the shadows. Years behind the shield taught me how to stay inconspicuous. Stick close to alleys, dodging street lights and cars. I follow her all the way to her apartment not far from where she worked. Sirens would flash past. Something came over me. I was out for a blood this night, reverting to my basic primal instinct. </p>
<p>She was never forgiving as this one. </p>
<p>After she woke up, she was surprised that she wasn’t tied up. She woke up with silk sheets and a quarter glass of wine. I was up at the wheel when she came up. She just came up and sat down, stared over the ocean and fingered her empty glass. She slurred something under her voice and I could already see the black puddles from her makeup starting to run.</p>
<p>“What are you going to do with me?”</p>
<p>I didn’t know what to say, this wasn’t premeditated, I just wanted to go sailing. I don’t answer and she starts to let it go.</p>
<p>“Where are my clothes…”</p>
<p>She looses it and locks herself down in the cabin. Indulge in a Black. An hour or two passes before she comes back up, pointing a Chef’s Knife at me. </p>
<p>“What do you think you’re doing?”  I ask her.</p>
<p>She demands, “Take me back to shore.”</p>
<p>“Or else you’ll slice me up? Cut me a new one?” Broads, always so irrational, hysterical, but plague you’re thoughts with lust and forbidden fruit. I tell her, “Go ahead,” but she expectedly breaks down again; they can never follow through. She drops the knife, and curls up on the floor.</p>
<p>She asks, “Are you going to make me into a dress;” The tears in her eyes, she’s actually serious. I get a headache. </p>
<p>“Get up! Sit down and listen.” She does as she’s told, and sits next to me. I pass the cig and she finishes it off in one long hit. She coughs and I ask her if even ever smoked. She shakes her head no, trying to hold back her tears. By now, her face is now black streams, and she looks like something out of a horror movie. </p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to frighten you.”</p>
<p>“Where are my clothes?”</p>
<p>“I threw them away.”</p>
<p>She pulls up the courage to ask, “Are you going to rape me?”</p>
<p>“Don’t flatter yourself, if I were going to do whatever to you, I’d have done it already. No, I need you’re services. Fifteen thousand, just for you’re company for the weekend.” She stays reluctantly quiet. “Listen, down in the cabin, the bedroom, next to where you woke up, there’s a cabinet. In it is five thousand and my Glock .38; It’s yours. You’re in control.”</p>
<p>By the time the sun was getting low, she was able to calm down some and go through a couple glasses of red wine. But, she never put down the gun once.</p>
<p> “Have you ever been out on the Pacific?” </p>
<p>“I’ve never been on a boat before,” she tells me with some excitement and intoxication. “I love it!” I imagine she’ll pass out any minute. She comes over, grasping the gun in one hand, a half empty bottle in the other, and straddles me. She lifts the bottle to her lips and lifts the gun to my temple.</p>
<p>“Why shouldn’t I just pull the trigger?” She could barely hold it up and I could tell she’d never fired a gun before; from the angle she held it, she’d break her wrist. Her eyes glow jade, hypnotic and peaceful, in the dim moonlight. </p>
<p>I tell her “I’ve already gone cold” and pry the bottle out of her fingers and finish it off. She locks her lips with me immediately after I drop the bottle. I watch her the entire time; her eyes are wide shut and after she opened them, she looked as if she were in love. She pulls herself off, and sits on the edge, hanging her legs through the rails, in the shadows.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow, I want to go swimming,” she tells me.</p>
<p>“You don’t have a suit.”</p>
<p>She doesn’t respond. She just sits there and I don’t know why but I feel as if I’ve known this girl.</p>
<p>“You remind me of someone,” I tell her.</p>
<p>She turns back and tucks her hair back behind her ear.</p>
<p>“Who, baby?”</p>
<p>”I can’t remember…” </p>
<p>Light a cigarette and feel that you need a drink. The radio’s spitting static, no other means of communication. I try to start up the engine but the fuels gone, there’s no wind, and no visibility. I’m a dead floating fish in the middle of an endless sea. I talk to the ocean and tell it about the way my wife use to smile at sunset. But it doesn’t respond back. What little memory I have left, her smile is all that I hold on to.</p>
<p>vAfter the incident, she never looked at me the same. She didn’t press charges, but I can tell she was changed. The truly sad thing is, I can’t remember what happened; my memory is a blur of a fantasy. I asked her about it once. She said she didn’t want to talk about it, and then she locked herself in our room. I sat leaned up against the door; I could hear her trying to cover her tears. She was in there for a week and went hungry but she never left me.</p>
<p>I think of her, panic. I don’t know which is worse: not knowing what I’ve done or knowing that I don’t know what I’ve done. Sweat starts to pour and I can’t keep my head straight, but it’s all a fog, a figment. I can hear my heart-beat, the vessels pulsating through my ears, my lungs get heavy and my fists get tight. I find the gun in my hand; it grinds and scratches between my teeth. I take one last breathe and shut my eyes. </p>
<p>A shot stands still over the ocean. </p>
<p>I drop to my knees, but I’m still alive. I drop the gun and hold the streams of sweat and tears. I can’t go through it. All I have are fragments of her, of myself. </p>
<p>She’s a whisper of a lie and I promise her I’ll find her.</p>
<p>The sun is setting, illuminating through a thick haze of golden fog. I hear my sail flap as the wind fills my hope. I jump to the wheel and turn the wheel till in the compass says east. We move blindly in the night. I’ll pick up another girl when I reach land, they always help me remember, but I always damage them, drive them away. How many times have I done this?</p>
<p>Hours pass. The moon full dots itself over the ocean. I imagine it’s about two but I really have no idea, there’s no time on a boat. I can’t get her out of my head. I look forward to the sun peaking up over the horizon and light my way, give me salvation. </p>
<p>I look out over my territory from the bow, take the nights last hit, contemplate, remember who she was, and breathe in smoke. She was a creature of the night, who sold herself for profit, sold to the eyes of a devil, sold to me. The ocean waves don’t speak, she doesn’t speak, but I now have one thing. I tell her that I’m sorry. I tell her that she was young and foolish and got too close. </p>
<p>“You gave me a piece of my memory back and for that I can never repay you.”</p>
<p>I never knew her name but she said to call her Dementia. Exhale smoke. </p>
