<center><b>Dead Man’s Hand.</b><br>
By Travis Rivas.</center><br><br>

<p>Chess great Aron Nimzovitch once jumped on the table during a match and screamed out ‘Why do I have to lose to this idiot?’ </p>
<p>I feel the same way. </p>
<p>Just two hours ago, I was sitting here with six other guys, more than half of all the chips sitting in front of me, looking pretty with a couple of cowboys staring back at me.  Now it’s just me and him, I’m short stacked and all I gotta look at is a busted straight with this little pissant’s toothy smile staring right back at me and a constant throbbing in my chest. With a smile like that, I can see why they call him “The Joker.” He bluffed me out of that last hand… turned over his cards and showed me a 7, 2 off suit.  </p>
<p>“Sorry, T.J.,” he says to me.  “Guess it’s just not your night.”  </p>
<p>Who the fuck does this little turd think he’s talking to?  I was winning ten thousand dollar pots before his parents we’re fucking in the mud at Woodstock.  </p>

<p>We’re in the hotel room watching a piece on this punk Ben Ashcroft when she says, “He looks like you.”  I tell her to shut the fuck up and I take another sip of my scotch.  </p>
<p>“I like his side burns,” she says. “Maybe you should grow side burns.  I think they’re hot.”</p>
<p>“You think money is hot.”  I switch the TV off, leave a few c notes on the nightstand and pick up my wedding band.</p>
<p>She doesn’t even bother to look away from Ashcroft when she says, “Don’t forget your Viagra, baby.”</p>

<p>“BOO-YAH! Full boat! Queens over eights!”  Again he beats me.   He set a bear trap that I never would have walked into ten years ago.  What’s wrong with me?  Am I just out of touch?  No, can’t be.  Just last week I won a tourney with five hundred people in it.  Most of them kids, most of them Internet players and I beat every single one… but why not this kid?</p>

<p>What happened to the days when a card player could come into a room, sit down at a table and play the game without any theatrics?  No one ever wore sunglasses to hide their eyes or t-shirts with advertisements on them.  You would sit around a table, grinding it out with seven other guys and if you lost, well than that was the shits and you would come back again tomorrow to play again.  </p>

<p>I like to sit at the black jack table before a big tournament.  I pull my hat down over my eyes and no one even recognizes me.  That’s when some guy…no, not a guy, a shaved grizzly bear with designer sunglasses and a diamond in each ear pushes me aside.</p>
<p>“Move it geezer, make way for Mr. Ashcroft!”</p>
<p>That’s when he sits down at my table.   He’s haunting me.  Of course he has his little entourage around him.  Along with the bear he has another bodyguard with him.  Whoever heard of a poker player needing bodyguards? Behind him is some grease ball with a thousand dollar suit and a cell phone in his ear.  On either side of him, are a blond and a brunette.  By the way their dressed, it’s easy to see that neither of them are professionals, but just as willing to give it up.  </p>
<p>This kid has to announce his presence wherever he goes.</p>
<p>“Alright, alright! The Joker is in the house and he is here to make some coin before the big game tomorrow!  Oh and anything with tits gets a drink on me!”</p>
<p>His catcalls end abruptly and that’s when I feel his eyes on me. The so-called “Joker” tilts his sunglasses down to get a better look.</p>
<p>“Oh my God! I can’t believe it!  It’s really him!”  I reach for my coat so I can get out of here before there’s a scene.  That’s when he runs over, leaving his cronies behind and taps me on the shoulder.  “Wow, I can’t believe it’s you.  I’m standing here in the presence of one of the greatest poker players ever.  You’re really Him.  You’re T.J. ‘the Shark’ McGrath.”</p>
<p>“That’s the rumor” are the only words I manage to get out of my mouth.</p>
<p>“Hey ladies come over here and take a look at a living legend among the poker gods.  Hey Bob, put your cell phone down and take a picture of the Joker and the Shark would yeah?”</p>
<p>“Sorry kid, I don’t do autographs.”</p>
<p>“What, oh no of course not.  I’m sorry. It’s just that I’ve been watching you play since I was a kid.  I mean I’ve based my whole style of play around you.  Whenever I’m playing a hand I always think ‘What would T.J. do?’ and somehow I always manage to…”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you hear me kid?  This isn’t the back stage at some Beetles concert so get the fuck out of here!”</p>
<p>Any semblance of hero worship washes right off his face.  “Yeah sorry, it’s just…well…I always wanted to meet you and…” He stops sputtering and turns around.  I walk away from the crowd that’s beginning to form from all the commotion when he turns around and says “Hey good luck at the tournament tomorrow.”</p>
<p>I don’t even turn around to say, “Fuck you” loud enough for him to hear it.</p>

<p>I’m all in with Ace, King suited and he calls me.  That’s when he turns over a pair of nines.  Any player with any sense about him at all wouldn’t have made that call with a middle pair like that.  Guess I pissed him off.  The flop comes out and it’s 10, Q, J… I just flopped the nuts straight.  The turn and the river don’t help him out at all.  I double up and get a second chance in this game.</p>

<p>After a lifetime of sitting in casinos, sucking in second hand smoke and drinking scotch your health tends to take a dive.  Fact is, all I have to show after my life of gambling is a wife who will barely talk to me, a son who won’t even acknowledge I’m alive, about as close as you can get to a drinking problem and a heart condition.  Angina, the doctor calls it.  </p>

<p>I’m walking down the strip, looking at all the lights and all of these casinos that are no older than the underwear I got on.  Every casino’s got a roller coaster with an arcade and two shows a night that you can take your kids to and three you can’t, while leaflets of Gina the mistress of pain are scattered all over the place.  I’m half way though this parade of cotton candy and used condoms, trying to find comfort in the last place that’s pure when I spot the Oasis.  At one point it was the premiere joint in Vegas next to Cesar’s.  The once vibrant yellows and greens one the outsides are reduced to little more than grays.  The sign that was probably the brightest in Vegas now only has at best every other light working.  This is the kind of place that once dealt in any vice and fantasy you could come up with and it couldn’t compare to the onslaught of family values coming in.  There’s a notice in front of the Oasis…I’ve read it a thousand times in front of a thousand other casinos.  “The Oasis to be demolished in such and such time, to make room for such and such bullshit.”  I think I spy something on the sign about Disney setting up shop when my chest does that throbbing thing that I’m all too familiar with. Probably all this walking isn’t doing me to good.  I turn the other way and head back to my hotel.  I wonder if I’ll ever see this new casino.</p>

<p>“Queen high flush, the ‘Shark’ takes the pot.”  Exclaims the announcer as I win another one.  </p>
<p>The Joker’s not smiling anymore; instead he has a familiar look to him.  Familiar because I was wearing the same look a half hour ago.  For the first time in a long time we are completely even, matched chip for chip.  Next hand, the dealer tosses me bullets. Two beautiful Aces that I’ve been waiting all night to see… Time the end this game.  I look right at the kid.  My pulse doesn’t even raise a beat.  </p>
<p>“I’m all in.”</p>

<p>Six hours to go before the tournament so I kill some time by going to a show with the white tigers and those two queers.  Flashes of light and puffs of smoke and there they are.  There must be six of them up there…Tigers not queers.  The crowd ooohs and aaahs at how cute the little ones are.  </p>
<p>Sitting next to me is a woman whose hair color is an unnatural orange, and twelve pounds of make up smeared all over her face.  Tammy Faye’s long lost sister.  Every time there’s a flash of smoke she screams “Oh my god how did they do that?”  What a fool! She’s taken in by the illusion, every time she lets another shrill cry out of her mouth, I want to strangle her so the only sound coming out is the gurgling of her choking on her own blood.  </p>
<p>Another flash, another tiger on stage. Three empty seats down from me I hear the thunderous claps of two meat hooks and a praise.  “Now that’s what I call a fucking show!”  Of course it’s him.  With the sun glasses and that smile that I hate.  He’s giving a standing ovation to these creatures that should be eating those two queers, tearing them limb from limb instead of obeying their every command, just for the reward of a Scooby snack.  </p>
<p>“And now ladies and gentleman.”  Says the blonde fruitcake.  “We have a very special treat for you.  In our audience, we have with us a very special celebrity.”  My heart begins to pick up speed.  “He is one if the greatest poker players the world has ever seen!  And if he would be so kind as to join us up on stage to be part of the show.”  I look around, did someone see me come in?  Do they really want me to go up there and be part of their illusion?  “Ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you…” I squint so the spotlight won’t burn my retinas when I’m draped in it and I start to stand.  “Ben ‘the Joker’ Ashcroft!”  </p>
<p>And for an instant the spotlight does hit me, only so it can pass me by and land straight on the fucking punk.  Everyone’s cheering for him but he’s just sitting in his seat, with his legs put up on the seat in front of him.  He doesn’t even look phased.  He allows the whistles and the thunderous roar go one for another few minutes before he even gets up out of his set.  To my right, Tammy Faye 2 is almost pushing me out of my seat trying to catch a glimpse at him, and I can feel the heat escaping her body and I think I feel a hint of drool touch my leg.  I consider staying in the hopes that as soon as he gets up there, the tigers go ape shit, grab him by the throat and start to eat his guts while he’s still alive.  I think better of it and start to walk out.   I’m half way up the aisle and out of the corner of my eye I can see the kid start to make his up to the stage.  I make my way to the door before he even has a chance to be mauled.</p>

<p>So here we are just the kid and me and we’re staring each other down.  We are two warriors who have trained their whole lives just to get a chance to destroy the other one.  I see that look on him that I once had and I know I have him.  The kid doesn’t hesitate for an instant.</p>
<p>“I call.” he says.</p>
<p>I flip over my cards and hit him square in the chest with both bullets.  He shows a pair of eights.  Oh kid…you just made the biggest mistake of your whole life.  </p>
<p>Did you ask yourself what I would before that hand you little fuck?  Or did you just get so trigger happy over seeing a pair and the chance to knock me out you didn’t even think twice?</p>
<p>That’s when the flop comes out.</p>
<p>Ace, King, Eight.</p>
<p>We both just made trips.  Except my trips beats his no question.  Finally my heart starts to do that stabbing thing that I know and hate.  I’m going to win…I’m going to win and I’m going to embarrass this kid in front of his bodyguards, his hack of an agent, the girls and everyone around the world.  I’m going to fucking beat him and there’s nothing that this fucking Joker can do to stop it.</p>
<p>The turn is the Two of spades.  No help to him.</p>
<p>There is only one card in the whole deck that can come so I won’t beat him and it’s not coming.  My hand reaches up and grabs my chest in the hopes that that just might make my heart slow down.  But it doesn’t, it never does.  The dealer hits the table twice, signaling that the river is coming out.  </p>
<p>I want to jump on the table, dance naked and flash my wrinkled gray haired testicles right in front of this kids nose and give him a taste of his own fucking medicine. Problem is, my heart won’t let me do anything except grab my chest. </p>
<p>The river comes out, and that’s when everything goes black.</p>
	
<p>Then I see an angel.  A halo around his head and he knows my name.  He’s asking me if I’m all right, saying not to worry and that help is own its way.  The halo fades away and I see the angels face, with a big toothy grin…the smile of a joker. </p>
<p>“I thought we lost you for a second there…for fucks sake, we lost you for more than a second.  About seven minutes actually.”</p>
<p>Around the angel I see more faces form a circle around me.  I hear other words that don’t quite make sense.  </p>
<p>“the Joker saved him!”</p>
<p>“…gave him mouth to mouth.’</p>
<p>“…can’t believe he put his lips on that old fart.”</p>
<p>So much going on but there is only one thing on my mind.  “I beat you you little prick.”</p>
<p>The toothy grin doesn’t even come off his condescending face.  He giggles and tells me “Yeah, you got me all right… never should have called you with that middle pair.  That’s twice tonight you caught me with my pants down… Don’t talk T.J., the paramedics are on their way.”</p>
<p>I smile and feel as though for the first time in a long time I can really sleep.  I’m drifting off into unconsciousness and hear more words I don’t understand.</p>
<p>“T.J. got the dead man’s hand, Aces over eights and then just feel right to the floor.”</p>
<p>“Yeah but what a river card…an eight, the only thing that could have beat T.J. and the Joker got it.”</p>
<p>I can barely make out what they’re saying but it doesn’t matter.  I finally won. </p>
