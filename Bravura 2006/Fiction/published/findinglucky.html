<center><b>Finding Lucky</b><br>
By Jon Aretakis</center><br><br>

<p>The cardboard box under his arm grew heavier with each step he took and the glare from the morning sun made his eyes squint. He tugged up his pants constantly; he knew if he did not, they would eventually fall to his knees. He wished he had remembered to wear a belt. He noticed Grady was rather comfortable, carrying only the backpack, which hung loosely over his shoulder, and his camouflage pants fit tight to his waist. John’s frustration grew as he walked down the trail squinting and pulling up his Levi’s while the weight of the box grew heavier. He would not complain; he knew he had to endure his discomfort in silence. Mentioning it would only cause Grady to make fun of his inability to prepare for the mission properly, and John was not about to give Grady that satisfaction. Besides, they had almost reached their destination. </p>
<p>The path weaved through acres of rolling hills covered in sage and wild grass; the grass beckoned gently to an occasional breeze. John stared up at the only two clouds in the sky. He thought they resembled cotton ships floating across an upside down ocean of blue, sailing toward some mysterious harbor. He would not bother to mention that to Grady either. He knew Grady would say they were nothing but clouds.</p>
<p>They veered off the path into a meadow and hiked toward an Oak tree that stood on the other side of a stream. As they jumped over the stream, with the help of a few well placed rocks, a coyote darted passed them and disappeared gracefully into some tall grass.</p>
<p>“Did you see that?” John said as he squinted and pulled up his Levi’s.</p>
<p>“Yeah, a coyote,”</p>
<p>“That’s a good sign.” </p>
<p>“What makes it a good sign?” </p>
<p>“Just is. When you see a wild animal, it’s a good sign.”</p>
<p>“Why do you think like that? Wow, a coyote, a wild dog… whoop-tee-dick.” </p>
<p>“Things have meaning. That was a good sign.” </p>
<p>“Na, man,” Grady said as he rolled his eyes.  “It was a coyote. We saw one because coyotes live around here. That’s it! There’s nothing special about seeing a wild animal.” </p>
<p>“Nope, that was a sign.”</p>
<p>“Was not.”</p>
<p>“Was too.”</p>
<p>“Whatever.” </p>
<p>They walked underneath the tree and sat down in the damp soil. The faint sound of running water could be heard coming from the stream. Spun between a few upper branches of the tree, spider webs covered with drops of morning dew glistened in the morning sunlight. Grady dug through the backpack and pulled out a canteen of water. He unscrewed the cap, tipped the canteen to his lips, took a giant gulp and passed it to John, who also took a drink. Grady pulled an army shovel from the backpack, snapped it into working position and set it on the ground. </p>
<p>“We better get started on the grave. They’ll be circling soon,” Grady said.</p>
<p>“It is not a grave.”</p>
<p>“Could be before the day is over.” </p>
<p>“I don’t want to get hurt. You’re getting in the hole, not me. This is your crazy idea so you’re getting into that damn hole. I’ll take the pictures.” </p>
<p>“I know. Who else would do it but me?”  </p>
<p>“That’s right. You do it.”</p>
<p>Grady picked up the shovel and walked out into the meadow. </p>
<p>“This looks good,” he remarked as he began to dig. </p>
<p>John walked out from under the tree, knelt down next to Grady and used his hands to pull grass and dig into the soil. John placed the dirt and grass into a neat pile while Grady flung the dirt and grass over his shoulder into the field. </p>
<p>“We’re going to need that. Put it around the edges please.” </p>
<p>Grady glanced at John for a moment, shook his head, took a shovel of dirt and placed it neatly in a pile next to the hole. </p>
<p>After they finished digging the hole, they walked back underneath the tree and rested. Grady gulped down some more water while John stared off into the sky. </p>
<p>“Do you think there’s a God?” </p>
<p>“No, I don’t. Why do you ask such questions?”  </p>
<p>“I try talking to God sometimes, but I don’t feel anyone is listening.” </p>
<p>“Who’s God? It’s just something people make up so they can deal with the cruelties of reality. God’s a myth.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?</p>
<p>“You need to get your head out of the clouds. I don’t think about God. All I think of is high school coming to an end, getting through college and joining the FBI. I don’t know if there’s a God. I really don’t care. You want to be a doctor?” </p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“So focus on that. Why do you ask questions that can’t be answered?”</p>
<p>“I’m curious. That’s all.”</p>
<p>“Why do you want to be a doctor?”</p>
<p>“So I can help people?”</p>
<p>“Does God have to exist for you to help people?”</p>
<p>“My desire to help people might be proof that God exists. Why do you want to be a FBI agent?”</p>
<p>“So I can shoot people legally.” </p>
<p>“You’re crazy.” </p>
<p>“I’m kidding.”</p>
<p>“You ready? They’ll be here soon.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m ready.”  </p>
<p>They grabbed the gear and crawled from under the tree. Grady turned his hat around backwards, removed a pair of leather gloves from the backpack, pulled them over his hands, sighed, looked at John, smiled and lay face up in the elongated hole. </p>
<p>“Are you comfortable?”	</p>
<p>“I’m good.”</p>
<p>John buried Grady’s legs and torso with the dirt and grass that lay around the edges of the hole. He opened the cardboard box and pulled out a gray rabbit. He held the rabbit by the scruff of its neck and pulled a small flea collar from his pocket. He fastened the collar tightly around the rabbit’s neck, pulled a short piece of string from his other pocket and tied one end of the string to the collar. He cleared the dirt away from Grady’s belt, tied the loose end of the string to it and again covered the belt with dirt and grass. </p>
<p>The rabbit sat atop the layer of soil above Grady’s stomach. John reached into his pocket and pulled out a Swiss army knife. He unfolded the blade, cut a small peephole in one side of the box and placed it over Grady’s head.</p>
<p>“Can you see? Can you see the rabbit?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I can see it.”</p>
<p>John picked up the empty box and the backpack and walked under the tree. He set the gear on the ground, reached into the backpack, pulled out a small camera and set it on the ground. He reached back into the backpack and pulled out binoculars, raised them to his eyes and peered into the sky.  After a moment, he set the binoculars on the ground, walked from beneath the tree and scratched his groan.</p>
<p>“I have to take a leak.”	</p>
<p>“Hurry up!” mumbled Grady from under the box.</p>
<p>“Relax, I’ll be right back.” </p>
<p>John walked down to the stream, unzipped his pants and began to urinate. He stared at the tulles, sage and grass that lined both sides of the stream and watched the water as it flowed over the rocks, through the crevices and momentarily settled into a clear pool. </p>
<p>A faint cry rang through the air. John squinted and peered across the stream. He scanned the small hillside for the source of the faint whimper and spotted a small creature covered in mud trying to crawl from the stream up a muddy bank. Is that a rat? John thought.</p>
<p>“It’s a puppy,” he blurted softly.</p>
<p>John watched as the puppy tried to crawl from the stream. Its face and body were drenched and muddy. While shivering and yelping, the puppy clawed its way a few feet up the bank but the slippery slope proved too much for the little creature. The puppy slipped back down into the stream. John finished urinating, zipped up his pants and walked through the water. He picked up the puppy and cradled him softly. While the puppy continued to whimper, John made his way to the middle of the stream, dipped the puppy into the water and rinsed the mud out of the animal’s eyes and soft coat. </p>
<p>While smiling and calming his new found friend with a few soft strokes to the head, John glanced up into the sky over the Oak tree; he saw a large hawk circling. The hawk soared through the air on powerful wings, gliding around as if were king of the winds.</p>
<p>“Holy, shit.”</p>
<p>Cradling the puppy gently, John hurried back to the tree. </p>
<p>The hawk circled lower and lower as John approached. Suddenly the predator dove down onto the rabbit. Dirt flew threw the air as Grady jumped up with a jerk, flung the box off his head and grabbed the hawk by its legs. His hat flew through the air and landed near the Oak tree.</p>
<p>“I got it. I got it! I did it, I caught a hawk.”</p>
<p>The hawk let out a loud scream, peered down at Grady and bit him on the nose. Grady screamed in pain as he removed one hand from the hawk's leg and rubbed some blood from his nose. The hawk raised its free leg and scraped its claw down Grady’s face. Grady’s anger boiled. He reached up, grabbed the hawk by its neck, made his other hand into a fist and punched the hawk in the head. The hawk let out a serious of loud squawks and reached down and bit Grady on the cheek. He screamed and released the bird. As the hawk flew away, the rabbit lay on its side and shook violently. Grady rolled over into the fetal position and moaned while John stood eyes wide beside the tree. The rabbit continued to flounder for a moment and then lay motionless.</p>
<p>“Are you all right?” John said softly as if speaking too loudly might make the pain worse for his friend.</p>
<p>“No, I’m lucky that thing didn’t pluck my eye out!”</p>
<p>“Did you get the pictures?” Grady said as he sat up.</p>
<p>“No, but I found a puppy.”</p>
<p>“A puppy?”</p>
<p>Grady rolled over to see the puppy in John’s arms. He stood up, wiped the dirt from his face, dusted the dirt from his clothes, wiped blood from his nose and cheek, walked over to John and peered at the small creature.</p>
<p>“Found him in the stream. It’s a male coyote pup.” </p>
<p>“Wow! You found a coyote puppy. You’re lucky.”</p>
<p>“It would seem I am,” John responded with a smile. </p>
<p>A stream of blood dripped down Grady’s cheek as he reached out to pet the puppy.</p>
<p>“You’re still bleeding.”</p>
<p>Grady wiped the blood from his face. “I know. How bad is it?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that bad. The scrapes aren’t that deep. You were lucky.”</p>
<p>“I guess we’re both lucky.” </p>
<p>“That’s what I’ll name him, Lucky. His name is Lucky. I told you there are signs. This is definitely a sign.”</p>
<p>“What sign? So you found a puppy… whoop-tee-dick.” </p>
<p>“This changes everything. I’m not going to be a doctor. I’m going to be a veterinarian. This is definitely a sign.”</p>
<p>John looked at the dead rabbit lying on the ground. </p>
<p>“We should bury the rabbit?”</p>
<p>“Why?” </p>
<p>“Because it is the right thing to do.”</p>
<p>“The rabbit is dead. Do you think burying it will make a difference?”</p>
<p>“I’m burying the rabbit.”</p>
<p>Grady walked under the tree, sat down, leaned up against the trunk, wiped blood from his face and looked at John.</p>
<p>“Go ahead. But it won’t help the rabbit.” </p>
<p>John buried the rabbit in the shallow grave and marked the spot with a few large rocks. He placed lucky inside the cardboard box while Grady flung the back pack over his shoulder and they began to head back toward their neighborhood. As they started to cross the stream, John turned to Grady.</p>
<p>“Know what I think?”</p>
<p>“No, what do you think?</p>
<p>“I think I found Lucky because I recognized seeing the coyote was a sign. You, a non-believer, thought the sign meant nothing. That’s why you’re bleeding. God has spoken.”</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t worry about becoming a doctor. You should think about checking yourself in to the nut-ward so a doctor can help you.” </p>
<p>“It makes perfect sense. You just lack the vision to see it. And I just told you that I don’t want to be a doctor anymore. I’m going to be a veterinarian.”</p>
<p>“Let’s just get back. I’m hungry. Better hope your parents let you keep that sign.”</p>
<p>“They will. Once I explain to them that it’s my destiny to raise him.”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe you didn’t get a picture of me and the hawk. How will we remember all this?”</p>
<p>“I can take a picture of your face,” John said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Funny.  Very funny.”</p>
<p>“I thought so.”</p>
<p>“Whatever,” Grady said, hopping to the other side of the stream.  “I’m hungry.  Let’s go eat.”</p>
