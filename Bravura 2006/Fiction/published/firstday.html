<center><b>First Day</b><br>
Bill Bailey</center><br><br>
	 
<p>The bright orange sun peeked over the distant hills as Nancy and her father left the barn. Nancy's father is a big man. Nancy has to run to keep up with his giant strides. Her father is her hero and she always watches when he milks the cows. Sometimes, in the spring he would let her ride on the John Deere while he plowed and planted the corn fields. Nancy could see in her mind, the yellow tractor and smell the diesel and fertilizer.</p>
<p>Today is a very special day for Nancy because it is her first day of school. Starting today, she will learn to read better and do arithmetic, what ever that is. She can barely contain her excitement. As Nancy and her father come into the kitchen, her mother says, "What took you so long? Don't you know school starts today?"</p>
<p>Her father smiles calmly and says, "There's time."</p>
<p>He never seemed to get as excited or worried as Nancy’s mom. Nancy is hustled upstairs to her room and her mother helped her into her new school dress. It was white with little yellow flowers. She loved the lace around the collar and the   short puffy sleeves. It was the most beautiful dress she had ever seen and she beamed with pride as she looked at herself in the mirror. "I love it, Mommy. This is going to be a wonderful day," she said.</p>
<p>As they went out the back door to the car, her mother handed her a shiny new pea-green lunch box. "I've packed an apple and a tuna sandwich for you. Kindergarten is only half a day so I'll pick you up in front of the school at twelve thirty."</p>
<p>It was a half hour drive to town and Nancy wished her mother would hurry. Nancy pressed her nose against the car window. She watched rows and rows of rippling waves racing across the fields of ripening grain. In the distance, a lone dust devil wandered aimlessly across a pasture while sleepy looking cows monotonously chewed. There were so many fascinating things in the world and she wanted to see them all. School would give her that opportunity, she was sure.             “Mommy,” she said. “The cows are brown. Our cows are white.”</p>
<p>“Yes Nancy, cows come in different colors.” </p>
<p>The bright morning sun streamed through the car window and lit her fiery braids. Looking down at the glow of her plaited hair, she watched the light catch the tiny platinum filaments streaking her bright red hair. Nancy looked up at her mother. Her mother's hair was darker, not quite so bright. "I hope I'm as pretty as Mommy when I grow up." Nancy thought.</p>
<p>The car pulled up in front of the school and Nancy started feeling a little uneasy. She saw other kids and their parents going into the building. She thought they looked strange but she couldn't identify what. They did have two arms, two legs and one mouth but, still, they were different. As she thought about her cousins she saw the difference. Most of these children had dark hair like Uncle Samuel. Uncle Samuel must have been a little boy once. Even some of the girls had dark hair. The thought had never occurred to her. People come in different colors too. She was excited at the discovery. She had learned something at school already.</p>
<p>Nancy and her mother walked into the school building and stopped before a green wooden door standing wide open.</p>
<p>"Nancy, this is Miss Jackson, she’s your teacher and she will take good care of you." Miss Jackson smiled as Nancy's mother gave Nancy a big hug. And said, "Be a good girl and I'll see you after school." Miss Jackson led Nancy to a seat at one of the little tables. Several other children were already there. One had big tears streaming down his face. "What's the matter are you hurt?" asked Nancy.</p>
<p>The boy didn't answer. He just put his head on the table and sobbed softly. More children came into the room, some were crying. Miss Jackson closed the door and asked the children to follow her. She showed everyone where to put their lunches and coats and showed them the bathroom. Everything was small. She didn't need the step stool to reach the sink. There were mats on the floor of the classroom. There were crayons and pencils and colored paper and they all sat in a circle while Miss Jackson explained the rules. They weren't all that different from the rules at home when Nancy's cousins visited.</p>
<p>At recess time, children outside climbed on the swings and teeter-totters. Nancy stood watching some of the kids on the playground toys when one little girl pointed to her and said. "Look at her. She’s a freckle face. Freckle face! Freckle face!" she chanted. Some of the kids giggled and some joined into the chant. Nancy was frightened. They were all looking at her. They clearly thought something was wrong with her.</p>
<p>"What do you mean? What's wrong?" She pleaded.</p>
<p>"You've got freckles. Those brown spots all over you're face,” said the little girl.</p>
<p>The other children had skin the same color all over. Why hadn't she seen this before? She was different. Nancy ran into the school, her vision blurred with tears. She ran to the bathroom and stared at the mirror. Pale blue eyes looked back surrounded by white skin covered with brown splotches. </p>
<p>It was like she had never seen them before. Freckles, she was different. She was ugly. She wanted to hide. No, she wanted to go home and never come to school again.</p>
<p>As she came out of the bathroom, the other kids where returning to the classroom. The boy she had seen crying earlier saw her hiding her face in her hands. He said, "My mommy has freckles and she's pretty. I think you're pretty."</p>
<p>Nancy felt better as she lay down on her mat for nap time. She hadn't thought of it before, but both her mother and father had freckles and they weren't ugly. In fact, all her family had freckles except Uncle Samuel. Maybe that girl was wrong about freckles.</p>
<p>After nap time, the day went quickly. She ate her lunch and sang a new song. Before she knew it, they were all filing outside. The school day was over and she found her mother waiting for her in the car. </p>
<p>As they drove home, Nancy hummed the tune she had sung in class. They came to the pasture. Now there were different cows</p>
<p>“Look Mommy, there’s a black cow,” She said.</p>
<p>“That’s a bull, baby.”</p>
<p>“Bull?”</p>
<p>“Cows are girls, Bulls are boys. Bulls come in different colors too.”</p>
<p>They drove further, arriving now at the field. A cloud making a big shadow, then it was bright again,</p>
<p>“What did you learn at school today?”</p>
<p>Looking up at her mother with a big smile, Nancy replied, "I learned I have freckles."</p>
