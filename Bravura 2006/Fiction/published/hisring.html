<center><b>His Ring</b><br>
By Erin Bradley</center><br><br>

<p>The shrinking resort, where the awards ceremony was held, is all I can see in my rearview mirror.  Cars passing by, on their way in, and I’m rushing to get out.</p>
<p>What was I thinking?</p>
<p>Was I thinking at all?</p>
<p>The haze of love perhaps?  Maybe just too much of that fancy red wine.  Was it the excitement of a closet, cluttered with coats that reeked of expensive perfumes?</p>
<p>My phone rings. It’s him. Fuck him.</p>
<p>I wish.</p>
<p>What was I thinking?</p>
<p>I can’t figure out if I’m pissed off that we got so close, or pissed off that we didn’t.</p>
<p>I hate him because he doesn’t hate me and I love him for the same damn reason.  The tightly confined closet and two beating hearts. Two crazed kissers, charged by too many free drinks.</p>
<p>I wanted to. I needed to.</p>
<p>I would have loved him and forever, never had him, but I needed to.</p>
<p>I, innocently searching for my black Burberry coat, and he, not so innocently searching for something.  What?  I still don’t know.  Was it for sex?  For love?  For me?</p>
<p>That unforeseen moment when the light flickered on. </p>
<p>“Do you need help finding your coat, Melissa?”  That unforgettable moment when the light flickered off.</p>
<p>That kiss, filled with passion, yet void of meaning.</p>
<p>“Wait, what are we doing?” I said, but it didn’t matter.  We both knew neither one wanted to stop.  He kisses me again, harder than before.</p>
<p>“I want you,” he whispers in my ear, the smell of alcohol overwhelming my senses.</p>
<p>He lifts me up, right leg, then left. He slams me up against the wall, hard with lust. His grip on me, so fierce, so intense, so caring. His hand behind my head, as to stop me from hitting the wall too hard.  Two coat hangers fall, and I hear someone’s keys fall out of a pocket. We don’t bother to stop and pick them up.  My left leg drops, and there we stand. His kiss, amazing with passion, heavy with lust.  His strong arm holds up my right leg, wrapped around his body.</p>
<p>“I’ve wanted this for too long now,” he says. His courage brought on by wine and whatever, mine brought on by his words.  I could fall in love with this man, and secretly, I have. From the moment I walked into his classroom, to this moment, where is right hand is roaming over my breast and his left hand his grazing my lower back creating chills like you wouldn’t fucking believe.</p>
<p>He breathes into my ear and softly nuzzles my neck.  My knees go weak.  And now, his touch makes me spout cheap clichés.  His hand moves from my breast to my face.  Because it’s not only about sex?  Because it’s more intimate than that?  The closet, so dark, his hand almost seeing the face his eyes cannot.</p>
<p>The passionate kiss ends and his lips move to my forehead, planting the softest, most sincere kiss over my left brow.</p>
<p>“You could make a man fall for you,” he says.  We kiss again, and I can feel his lips forming a smile underneath mine.  My face, fitting sweetly in his hand, nuzzles it for comfort.  I put my little hand directly over his, feeling each knuckle, feeling each crevice, feeling his ring.</p>
<p>His hand drops, quick, as to hide the ring.  But I know its there.  I’ve seen it many times.  Each look at him is clouded by the vision of that ring.  My right leg drops and I rush to get away.</p>
<p>I love him, until I remember his life.  Forgotten by lust, reminded by a ring.  My eyes a blur from too many tears, my mind no longer clouded by a drunken haze.</p>
<p>Haven’t I said I’d fallen madly in love with him?</p>
<p>Wasn’t it what I’ve wanted to happen?</p>
<p>“Not like this,” I think to myself.  He’s married and I love him.  I will never have what I want from him, and it’s never just about sex in a closet after receiving a reward for writing some great essay that took me 20 minutes.  I just got lucky.  Except, not lucky enough to be loved by a man whose love belongs to someone else.</p>
<p>My phone rings again.  I’d given him my number as an R.S.V.P. for this special occasion, and I regret it now.  I answer and he says “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“Me too,” I say.  “See you in class on Monday.”</p>
