<center><b>Patterns of History</b><br>
By Andrew Watkins</center><br><br>

<p>Hold on to this flesh.  Grab anything you can.  We’re all going down some big damn meat grinder, but I’m going to escape.  Every time I put my hand in the dirt, it scares the shit out of me.  I’ll be a part of this someday, cold and alone, my body rotting in the dirt.  And it terrifies everyone.  Me included.  Nothing scares people more than rotting corpses.  But you know, right now I'm driving in my new car.  I'm going to the mall later on to buy a fabulous 40 dollar t-shirt because I'm a cool guy, and cool guys wear cool t-shirts.  And I can own a house and I can watch all the movies I want. </p>
<p>Movies—that’s the ticket.  Murder mysteries, shoot-‘em-ups.  I'm not the guy at the wrong end of the gun, but let me tell you that I don't mind watching.  I’m safe at home, watching the carnage and even laughing at them occasionally.  I think I'll stay right where I am, and wait for those wonderful, hard working scientists—oh, the powers they possess!—to find a cure for death.  Until then, the TV puts me in the right frame of mind. Sometimes I feel like I’ve got too many problems, and if I could only talk to someone who knew the answers, then….</p>
<p>But everyone who's tried to explain things has had some kind of agenda.  In fact, I'm tired of asking because when someone sees you might be asking them to explain something to you, they suddenly become a fountain of fucking wisdom.  Everybody wants to be the Pope these days, but the Pope wouldn't be cool even if he did wear this awesome bright blue Volcom t-shirt.  And there's plenty of styles you can wear, from punk rock to hip hop and you can do whatever drugs are in fashion.  Pot, speed, X…this is southern California, after all.   No place like it on earth. Whatever you want, you can get.  So many commercials.  I like the funny ones. </p>
<p>Then there are these environmentalists. They're always saying the world is coming to an end.  I put out my recyclables, so fuck off. They just want to play bongo drums and sit in the park smoking weed. I get up every morning and go to the construction site, where I do a day’s work for a day’s pay.  That's more than they can say.  They say to stop the war, but if brave American soldiers weren't fighting for our freedom, those people from those fucked up parts of the world would think they could do whatever they wanted. This is America.  Land of the free.  Love it or leave it.  </p>
<p>Terrible things are happening everywhere else in the world.  What the fuck is wrong with those people?  In America we build our roads straight and wide. We plan entire communities, so that you don't have to worry about anything.  Food from the grocery market, hot water, heating, none of the kinds of people who bring down property values, electricity, garbage collection, and most of all, plenty of entertainment.  Although I'm always bored, and need a little trouble to spice things up.  </p>
<p>Ah!  TV to the rescue again.  Here's my favorite show on now.  They're crucifying a southern racist in this episode.  Racism is really bad, and as long as you don't say anything mean to those people on the other side of the schoolyard, you've got a sure ticket to Heaven.  At least we can still go to church and be seen with some of the other good people—for the most part.  I saw one family there whose son is gay, but none of us talked to them.  So, anyways, this is life, and it's pretty good.  The key is to stick with the right crowd.  Lotsa crazy people out there, but they'll all disappear eventually.  Then just the good people like me and a few others who know what’s going on and keep our noses clean will go to heaven, where we’ll all get a big tract mansion with a swimming pool and a manned gate out front. </p>
