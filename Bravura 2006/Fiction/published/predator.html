<center><b>Predator</b><br>
By Mike Eastman</center><br><br>

<p>The chubby little brat jiggled and jaunted along the brick wall, his tender pale flesh now rosy from the physical exertion of his seductive dance.  The amber rays of sunlight reflected off his pudgy thighs, like an over glazed slab of pork covered in quivering succulent fat.  His glistening pores secreted his own personal marinade, a salty pungent stench that caused my tongue to roll around within my moist jaws.</p>
<p>I longed to paw at his flesh.  To slide my rough tongue into the crevices of his form, tasting the pockets of collected sweat.  My loins began to flex, my breathing became hard as the babe danced further from his parents and closer to me.  Me.  Waiting in the barbarous bush.  Coolly.  Poised.  Ready to pounce.</p>
<p>Finally my moment had come.  The frolicking swine hit a loose brick in the wall and tumbled into the concealing brush where I lurked.  As I strode forward toward the blubbering mass of tenderness, I heard the words that I had longed to hear since imprisonment.  "HELP!  My baby!  He's fallen into the lions cage!"</p>
