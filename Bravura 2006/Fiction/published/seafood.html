<center><b>Seafood</b><br>
By Kevin London</center><br><br>

<p>My Saturdays were nearly always God-awful adventures in tedium. This particular Saturday had been no different than the usual. I sat on the couch in my underwear and clicked the remote in the same way I would click a pen during a long-winded lecture back when I was in school. Saturdays were bad, but more than anything I dreaded the inevitable Monday grilling at work by co-workers about what I had done over the weekend.  “Nothing” was my canned response to this question more often than not. I wish I had the kind of action-packed lifestyle that would permit me to say otherwise, but it didn’t seem likely that my current situation would change any time soon.  I would just have to resign myself to the nothingness I knew so well. Nothingness and I had quickly become weary friends.</p>
<p>My musing was interrupted by the phone jittering in its holder. My phone seemed to be perpetually overexcited. It could never contain itself when announcing a call. It would leap from its cradle as soon as it was summoned and then scream in protest as the receiver vibrated on my table top. This particular Saturday I wasn’t particularly expecting a call, so I hesitated. My mental voices immediately kicked into chorus. “It’s a telemarketer, don’t bother,” and “Hey, maybe it’s Jake finally returning my call!” “It could be your mother.” Oh Christ, I thought I’ll just answer the phone. If I didn’t answer, I would just wonder who had called. My feet shuffled slowly along the floor toward the noise as the phone vibrated in ecstasy another three or four times. Finally, I silenced the phone’s tantrum by answering.</p>
<p>“Joel! Where the hell have you been?” Oh. It was Steven calling.</p>
<p>“Oh. Hey Steven. You know, around. Doing things.” He laughed like it was the funniest thing he had heard since he woke up. Knowing him, that could’ve been as recently as thirty minutes ago. Considering it was five o’clock in the afternoon, that was pretty good for Steven. I grimaced and tentatively held the phone a little further from my ear as though the receiver had caught fire and was about to melt.</p>
<p>“Well, are you doing anything today?”  he asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah, actually. I’m kind of in the middle of something,” I said.  I looked at the television flashing images of another infomercial for an amazing hair growth drug.</p>
<p>“Come down to the docks with me. You’ll have a lot of fun. I guarantee you won’t regret it.” Steven knew me too well; he could always tell when I was lying. </p>
<p>“I’m busy right now but I guess I could squeeze you in. What time were you thinking?”</p>
<p>“Six PM,” he replied without waiting for my response. “I’ll see you there, buddy.”  </p>
<p>I heard a click. It was nice of him to assume I was free at six. Steven was always the considerate one in our friendship. I wondered absently what I had gotten myself into. We had somewhat of a history of hanging out at the docks. We both grew up in the same coastal area so it seemed a natural fit to hang out by the sea. We were friends in elementary school and we stuck to each other like glue. We grew older, things changed. He grew to love life and his girlfriend. I grew to hate him. I never said anything though, it wouldn’t be polite. Frowning, I turned off the talking heads on the screen. I went outside and climbed into my car to meet Steven. It was going to be a long night.</p>
<p>Steven waved at me as I arrived. I could tell he had already had a few drinks. I didn’t normally drink so I had no problem being the designated driver. The only real problem I had was that whenever I was around Steven I wanted to drink. He walked over to me as I got out of the car.</p>
<p>“Joel, you look great.” I looked like shit but he was too nice to say so. I knew I still had the gaunt, hollow look that accompanies watching too much television. He lazily draped his arm over my shoulder. “I’ve got good news!” He paused for a moment. I sighed with resignation.</p>
<p>“Alright, what is it?”</p>
<p>“Jeez buddy, you could at least try to be excited for me,” he said. He paused to guzzle his beer. “I’m going to be a dad.” </p>
<p>“I’m happy for you,” I said mechanically.</p>
<p>This news to me was like sucking in air when you have a cavity. The pain took my breath away.  Steven’s wife Jennifer was the one girl I had desired in high school. We became friends in freshman year but it took me until junior year to work up the courage to ask her out. Steven was proud of me and my progress. I was proud of my progress too, until the night of our first date when, at the last minute, I got sick. Steven, always the gentleman, offered to go in my place so that she wouldn’t feel like she had been stood up. Like every storybook tale, they hit it off instantly and dated seriously for a while. Shortly after high school, Steven proposed. My dream life with Jennifer became Steven’s reality.  I thought the wedding was bad enough. Now I got to look forward to baby showers and little Stevens. </p>
<p>“Yeah dude! Jennifer’s starting to swell up like a balloon. It’s great.” He beamed at me. I imagined my high school sweetheart looking like a bloated paper mache pig. In spite of all the times I disliked Steven, eventually it was impossible to avoid liking him. I would say it was the key to our friendship. </p>
<p>“Congratulations on the tiny monster. You think it will have three claws on each hand or four?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Very funny. You’re a real jokester, you know that?”  He punched me on the arm.</p>
<p>“I’m well known for my wit and good looks,” I replied.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you were able to make it tonight,” he said. “When I called, I was a little worried you would turn me down like normal.”</p>
<p>“I’m always just so busy, Steven. It’s hard for me to slip away from work.” </p>
<p>“I know you’re not really that busy. I know you just sit at home and watch TV. I bet you were doing that when I called tonight.” He put down an empty can of beer and picked up another one. </p>
<p>Frowning, I found myself smack dab in the middle of Pout Town. Knowing he was right, he grinned at me and then looked as though he was struck by a great idea. I grew more worried.</p>
<p>“You should come over to our house tonight and have dinner with us. Jennifer’s been asking about you. I’m sure she’d be thrilled to see you.” He opened his hands in an exaggerated manner. “Telling you man, just like a balloon. You gotta see it to believe it.”</p>
<p>The thought of seeing Jennifer again left me feeling queasy. I tried to change his mind. “But we just got here, Steven. I was looking forward to just kicking back by the water tonight. I wanted to hang out just like old times.” Even as I heard myself I didn’t believe a word of it.</p>
<p>“We can have a quiet night at my house with just the three of us. If anything, that will be more like the old times than this would have been.” </p>
<p>Looking squarely at him, I said “You’re in no condition to drive.”</p>
<p>He teetered over the curb.  “I’m just a little buzzed. Plus, it’s ok. I know these roads like the back of my hand.”</p>
<p>I stopped arguing with Steven and just climbed into his car. His car smelled vaguely of cigarettes and stale cologne. The nostalgia from seeing Steven after such a long separation was quickly fading. I could already see that I was going to be wrangled into another crazy adventure where one or more people wind up drunk or accompanied by hookers at the end of the night. Steven was apparently determined to be the first drunk person in our party.</p>
<p>He climbed in the car and turned the radio on to some obnoxious DJ that was surely named something like Ripsaw. I watched the ocean I’ve loved since childhood fade away as we sped off into the night. I had always favored the Atlantic. There was something so intriguing about it. The Pacific is billed as the pleasant ocean but the fan club is much smaller for the Atlantic. People seem to have a difficult time learning to appreciate the Atlantic’s brooding demeanor. I had looked forward to watching the ocean quietly with Steven, but I hadn’t actually expected it. At this point, I would’ve settled for a longer look at it as it sped past us in the hearse he called a car.</p>
<p>Steven tried to make conversation. I feigned partial deafness. Steven had a way of ruining perfectly good silence. We arrived at his compact suburban cottage shortly after seven. It looked better than I had remembered it. His wife, Jennifer, stood in the door. She was expecting us. He had planned this all along. Dammit Steven I thought. </p>
<p>“Hi Jennifer!” I yelled, stumbling as I climbed out of the car. </p>
<p>She was still cute. The dim light hid my admiration.  She had never been beautiful when we were younger but she was approaching it now as she showed the first visible signs of her pregnancy. Steven was roughly half right with his balloon statement. Her wavy hair up was lifted into a loose bun. Her lips curled slightly with her trademark smirk. I had forgotten the way her eyes bore tiny holes into me. Until that moment, I had forgotten how much I missed Jennifer.</p>
<p>“Hey Joel.” She ran up to me and gave me a hug. The hug lasted both one second too long and several minutes too short. I suddenly felt very awkward. </p>
<p> “We’re having seafood casserole. I hope you’re hungry,” she said. I cursed Steven once more for planning this. He knew seafood and I had an agreement. I wouldn’t eat it and, in return, seafood would not make me deathly sick later on. Tonight Steven was making me break this truce.</p>
<p>“I’m so hungry I could eat a stable of horses,” I replied. It wasn’t nearly the smooth answer I was hoping for.</p>
<p>We walked inside and I put my coat on one of those cliché 1930’s coat racks that seemed completely out of place in its own time, let alone in a modern house. I followed them into the living room. The living room was also a strange fit, but it worked for them. It was small enough to be cozy but not cramped. They each took seats and I followed suit. Steven’s hand folded over hers. She looked at me.</p>
<p>“It’s been so long since I’ve seen you last! What have you been up to?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, you know, not too much. I’ve mostly just trying to keep busy. I’ve been hanging out with friends on occasion. It’s pretty much the same ho-hum stuff as usual.”</p>
<p>“Well, what about your job then? Are you still doing the consulting thing?”</p>
<p>“Ah. Yes, I am. It’s fun in a soul-sucking way. You’d be surprised how little you miss your soul after it’s gone. Money is money, though, so I can’t complain. How about you? Are you still heading the marketing department at Donnelly?” </p>
<p>“Yes, I’m surprised you remembered. I’m asking for a raise soon, actually. They work me hard enough, so I figure I deserve it because I have to keep working after the baby comes.” She elbowed her husband.  “Maybe some day Steven will have half as much success with the company as I’ve had.” She leaned towards me in her chair and laughed. </p>
<p>“Sweetheart, you always know just the right thing to say to make a guy feel good,” Steven said. He was an artist by trade but I wasn’t sure they called them artists at his marketing firm.</p>
<p>“It comes from years of practice,” she said, laughing. The oven beeped twice. “Oh. I guess the casserole is ready to go. Steven, would you mind taking that from the oven? I’m going to go grab a bottle of wine. Joel, would you like to join me?  I could use your help.” </p>
<p>Steven was out of sight before I could answer her. “Yeah, I’ll tag along.” I said. From the kitchen, I could hear the oven door creaking open.</p>
<p>She led the way down the darkened staircase to the basement. The steps creaked beneath us as we walked slowly down the flight of stairs. She approached the wine rack and browsed. I moved next to her. </p>
<p>“This one look good?” She said, raising a bottle of wine I could not even pronounce the name of, let alone recognize. </p>
<p>“Yeah, that one should be fine.”</p>
<p>I turned a little to head back upstairs. I felt her hand tugging at my collar. I turned back towards her. Suddenly, she planted her lips on mine. They were softer than I could’ve imagined. I kissed back. She wrapped her arm around my neck and pulled me in closer.  I heard Steven bustling about upstairs. This was probably the first event tonight that Steven hadn’t planned. He knocked on the basement door. </p>
<p>“You two kids find a winner yet?” he yelled as if he were an explorer yelling into the gaping mouth of a cave. I suppose in a way he was. She pulled back. </p>
<p>“Yeah, we found one! Be right up,” she replied.  </p>
<p>As I followed her up the stairs, I was more confused than I had been in years. My friend’s pregnant wife just kissed me on the lips. That’s got to break some sort of friend code. It’s probably right there in Subsection 4-B – “Thou shalt not kiss thine friend’s pregnant wife.” Hell, Section 4 itself is likely “Thou shalt not kiss thine friend’s significant other, period, or thou shalt regret it and want to drink thine self into oblivion.” Why did she have to break the code? My mind was struggling to cope. It was as though I had been calmly relaxing on a hammock on a summer day and, suddenly, someone spun the hammock. I was tumbling. Still, it had felt good to kiss her.  I realized Steven was staring at me.</p>
<p>“Yeah, what? Huh?” I asked, dazed.</p>
<p>“Joel, you ok?” Steven actually sounded concerned. </p>
<p>“I’m fine. I was just collecting my thoughts.” I laughed nervously and rubbed the back of my neck. </p>
<p>“Dinner’s ready, so come and get it. It’s so fresh, you’ll swear the sea made a personal delivery to your taste buds,” he said.</p>
<p>I grinned at Steven and plodded up the stairs. When I entered the dining room, I noticed that there was a place set for me and some food already on my plate. I sat opposite Jennifer. Steven opened the wine and poured some for each of us. He raised his cup in a toast.</p>
<p>“To the tiny monsters in our future,” he said. </p>
<p>“To tiny monsters,” I agreed. Jennifer looked at the two of us as though we were crazy and then just shook her head. She peered at me over her glass as she drank her wine. Oh God, this wasn’t helping at all. I refilled my drink.</p>
<p>I dug into my food while making as little eye contact as possible. They soon followed suit and the three of us merrily chomped away at an amalgam of seafood and casserole. The meal exceeded my expectations, but I wouldn’t say that the sea had made a personal delivery to my taste buds. A long time elapsed before anyone broke the silence. </p>
<p>“Joel, you still dating Regina?” Steven inquired.</p>
<p>“No, Steven. I stopped dating her about four months ago.”</p>
<p>“Oh! What happened?” Jennifer asked. </p>
<p>“We had a different set of goals. I wanted to find happiness and someone I could share my life with. She wanted to make me miserable.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Joel,” Jennifer said sadly. </p>
<p>“It’s ok. It’s all turned out for the better,” I said. I paused to chew my food. I needed to change the subject. “Do you guys think it will be a boy or a girl?”</p>
<p>“The doctor said it will be a girl. I’ve always wanted a little girl,” Jennifer said.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s good.” I responded.</p>
<p>I felt like I was in high school again. It was awful. I caught myself wondering if I had stepped into a time machine and I had abruptly re-entered my teenage years, worrying about first kisses and wondering what to say in front of girls. </p>
<p>They asked me a few more questions about work and old friends. I ate as fast as I could.  Jennifer’s gentle eyes settled upon me more times than I could count. Every time she looked at me and I caught her eye, all I could recall was the soft grip of her hand on my shirt collar and the feel of her lips against mine. </p>
<p>I pushed my chair out. “Well, it was great. Thanks for the splendid meal and the … wine.” I looked at Steven. I realized he had drunk a good deal more than I had during the meal. His eyes were fluttering open and closed. It was at that moment I remembered that Steven had driven me to his house. </p>
<p>“I’ll take you back to the docks. Steven drove you, didn’t he?” Jennifer said.</p>
<p>“Are you sure that’s a good idea?” I asked. I wasn’t sure exactly why I was protesting. </p>
<p>“It would be my pleasure,” she replied. </p>
<p>We carefully moved Steven to the couch and went outside. We both got in her car. It was a much smaller car than Steven’s horrible hearse-like counterpart. It smelled faintly of her perfume. I liked the smell. She started the car and we drove through the foggy evening in silence for several minutes. She interrupted my vigilant watch of the night conditions outside my window. </p>
<p>“So. . .” she said.</p>
<p>“So what? What do you mean by ‘so’?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” she said. She became silent.</p>
<p>The silence was awful. It bore down on me like a book bears down on a wrinkled poster in need of smoothing.</p>
<p>“What was that back there? What happened in the basement?” I asked finally.</p>
<p>“I kissed you,” she said.</p>
<p>“Yes, that. Why did you do that?”</p>
<p>“I wanted to see what it was like to kiss you. I’ve always wondered what it would feel like.” She bit her lip and looked at me for a second. “Joel, why didn’t you show up for our first date?” she inquired.</p>
<p>“I had the flu.” I said readily.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe you. I don’t really think you were sick.” </p>
<p>“I … I was sick that day,” I said. Several minutes passed.</p>
<p>“Ok, I was nervous. I asked Steven to go instead of me,” I said.</p>
<p>“Joel, I…” She trailed off.</p>
<p>“I was worried you wouldn’t like me, so I didn’t show,” I confessed. “I feel like I made the right decision. You and Steven hit it off immediately and you’re still together. Steven isn’t like me; he’s a good guy.”</p>
<p>“You’re right, Steven isn’t like you. Steven doesn’t have your sensitivity. Steven doesn’t have your face. Steven doesn’t have your touch. Steven doesn’t have a million tiny things that I like about you. I love him, sure, but ultimately he isn’t you.”</p>
<p>“You could’ve told me that back then. Things could’ve turned out differently,” I said.  “You could’ve told me you didn’t really love Steven.”</p>
<p>“I never said I didn’t love Steven,” she said defensively.</p>
<p>“You didn’t have to say it. I could tell by the way you claimed that you did love him.”</p>
<p>She frowned. The lines in her face creased in ways I hadn’t seen before. She cried quietly.</p>
<p>“I wish it didn’t have to be this way. I wish we could go back and fix everything,” she said as she pounded on the steering wheel. We were swerving slightly on the road but my safety was, for the moment, the least of my worries. For that matter, I wasn’t worried about Steven either.</p>
<p>“It’s not too late to change this Jennifer. You can still change your life. You don’t have to be with Steven. You don’t even have to be with me.”</p>
<p>“No I can’t. It’s too late. In case you haven’t noticed, I’m pregnant,” she said. “I’m pregnant, Joel! It’s about more than just Steven and I!” </p>
<p>I leaned over and I kissed her on the cheek. </p>
<p>“It’ll be ok,” I said.</p>
<p>“No, it won’t. I don’t believe you.” Now she was sobbing. </p>
<p>We had arrived at the docks but I hadn’t even noticed. Her car was idling next to mine.</p>
<p>She was staring down at a spot on her car mat. “Jennifer, it will be ok,” I said as I turned her head towards me.  She nodded slowly. I pulled a slip of paper from my pocket and wrote my number on it. </p>
<p>“I want you to call me later. We can talk about this – work through it.” </p>
<p>“Joel, don’t go,” she said. She was practically whispering. I had to lean in closer to hear what she was saying.</p>
<p>“… What?”</p>
<p>“Joel, just stay here for now. Just for a second.” She grabbed my collar again and pulled me into another kiss. I could taste the saline from her tears. I kissed her and it felt like an eternity before I pulled away. I gave her a long hug and then I clicked open the door. I began to get out of the car.</p>
<p>“Jennifer, you’re drunk. I’m drunk. I don’t want us to do anything we’ll regret.” </p>
<p>I could feel the heat of her stare on my back. Her sobs grew more ragged. She protested through her tears. Her words slurred together. My shirt was damp where her head had been on my shoulder.</p>
<p>“Goodbye, Jennifer,” I said as I stepped out of the car. I felt the gravel crunching underneath my feet. I heard her crying as I closed the door behind me. </p>
<p>Before I could think about it, I said it. “I love you.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t bring myself to look back at her. I wanted to stop myself from leaving her. I wanted to turn around and hold her in my arms – this other man’s wife – and kiss her until she stopped crying. I wanted to kiss her until she didn’t hurt anymore. </p>
<p>I walked down to the beach. I cried as the waves washed slowly in and out. I always liked the Atlantic Ocean. It’s a much more complex ocean than the Pacific. The Pacific’s main attraction is its calm, clear waters but the Atlantic holds its secrets deep within. The Atlantic practically dares observers to discover what lies beneath its turbulent surface. The Atlantic is an ocean you can really grow to love.</p>
