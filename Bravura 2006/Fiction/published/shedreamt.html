<center><b>She Dreamt She Was A Bulldozer</b><br>
By Nolan Turner</center><br><br>

<p>Claire and I stayed as faithful to each other as we could.  We were perfect for one another, after all.  But sometimes the drinks were free and sometimes the smiles at the end of the bar were new and mysterious and sometimes the nights were just a little too cold and sometimes the poverty and loneliness just stung a little too much.  But when it was all said and done I loved her and she loved me, and that’s all that matters, right?  I could set her free and she’d come back—she always came back.</p>
<p>The thought of Claire screwing other guys didn’t bother me all that much; it was the kissing that drove me crazy.  She could’ve fucked the whole Bay Area and I would have forgiven her as long as the kisses didn’t mean anything.  But the thought of her sharing that tender kiss with another guy—the kiss I was selfish and stupid enough to believe was only for me—made me want to vomit.  When she’d go out for the night I’d usually just drink until I pissed myself and fell asleep in a sea of vomit, gin and urine.  When she came home I’d wake up and throw myself at her feet, praising God she was back.  I would try to kiss her but she wouldn’t have any of it—“Alex,” She’d say, throwing her coat onto our old brown recliner, “Look at you, you’re covered in piss.  What the hell were you drinking?  It smells like rubbing alcohol in here.”  I’d start to ramble on about her fucking other guys.  She’d never talk to me until I sobered up.  We’d get into bed just as the shafts of light from the morning sun started to creep into our bedroom and she’d apologize, even though she knew it wasn’t necessary, “You know I’m sorry Alex…it doesn’t mean anything, sometimes I just get carried away...”  I know, I’d say, and kiss her forehead gently.  I did the same thing.  I just think in the end I was more sensitive than her, or at least I showed it more easily.  </p>
<p>I met Claire in college.  Washington State.  Thanks mom and dad.  I was an obnoxious English major who listened to the MC5, smoked pot and thought the world was fucked.  She was a philosophy major who listened to Nick Drake, smoked A LOT of pot and thought the world was just fine.  Well fell in love our senior year and dropped out.  We spent the next few years wandering along the Pacific coast, eventually settling in San Francisco.  All we could afford was a tiny basement apartment on Haight Street.  The landlords, Mr. And Mrs. Shaw, were a nice couple from Texas.  They moved to the bay area about ten years ago to get away from the dry Texas heat.  Mrs. Shaw took a shine to me because I “had a good head on my shoulders”, and Mr. Shaw flocked to Claire because she was the “hottest piece of ass” he’d ever seen.  Our relationship with the Shaw’s worked out well for us—we didn’t always need money to pay the went.</p>
<p>Cash was always an issue for us.  Claire’s job at a record store didn’t pay well, and I’d have months at a time where I didn’t have any money coming in.  Writing’s a tough thing to break into when you don’t know anyone and don’t have any money and aren’t particularly good.  I made some cash every now and then doing art for local bands: fliers, album covers, t-shirts, all that.  Problem was the bands were even worse off than us so I rarely got paid in cash…just shirts or records or passes to shows.  But we survived, we didn’t need a lot of money to live.  Claire stole any of the records we wanted from her store and never got fired, even though everyone knew she did it.  That’s what girls have over guys, they can get away with that kind of thing—well, the good-looking ones at least.  People are usually more sympathetic to a cute young girl with a nice body and a quavering voice.  Her flirtatious demeanor worked to my advantage a lot, so it was hard for me to get down on her about it.  It’s a lot easier to overlook a person’s faults when they’re all you’ve got.  Despite all the shit we pulled on each other we both knew there wasn’t another person who gave a damn about us in the world.  </p>
<p>Claire didn’t believe in marriage.  For a while she had me convinced I didn’t either.  Even the discussion of marriage made her uncomfortable.  She shied away from the topic in every imaginable form.  One summer our landlords were heading off to Las Vegas to renew their wedding vows, and they wanted me and Claire to be their best man and maid of honor, respectively.  I remember the day I asked her if she wanted to go; it was a warm summer afternoon and the air was humid and salty coming down from the crowded streets.  We were listening to the new Slint record that had just come out, Spiderland.</p>
<p>“The Shaw’s invited us to go to Vegas with them this weekend.”</p>
<p>“Oh?  What’s the occasion?”</p>
<p>“They’re renewing their wedding vows, I guess.  Sweet, huh?”  </p>
<p>She wasn’t listening.  Her thoughts were somewhere far off…on an isolated shoreline drizzled with ice.</p>
<p>“Claire?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it nice that the Shaw’s are renewing their vows?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, it is.”</p>
<p>“Well?”</p>
<p>“Well what?” She was annoyed.</p>
<p>“Do you want to go?”</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry…No, not really.  Just listen to the music, this album is fantastic.”</p>
<p>Her parents split when she was 14.  From what she tells me the whole thing was pretty nasty.  It hit her really hard because she’s an only child; there was no one for her to confide in.  Once when she was at her father’s place she tried to kill herself.  She downed half a bottle of Vicodin and chased it with a few shots of Grey Goose.  She was in a coma for a few months after that.  The doctors gave her about a 30% chance to live—but damnit, Claire’s a tough chick.  She fully recovered and ran away when she was 16.  She had to work three jobs to put herself through college, but she always said it was the best thing she’d ever done.  I guess that’s what I loved about her—she’d been to hell and back, to the very bottom of the bottle, and I know it’s cliché—but if anything she’s stronger for it.  She knew that the world was fucked up but she could still see all the beauty around her.  She told me once, “You know Alex—there’s beauty in this place—but we don’t always see it.”</p>
<p>She was the kind of girl I always wrote about but never actually knew.  She had the kind of life I used to wish I had.  That kind of life was great for a writer—all the hardships and triumphs really gives your stuff the kind of authenticity you couldn’t buy or fake.  But me…I was a rich little shit with a nice car and happy parents.  After a while the whole thing made me sick.  So I started to write about people struggling with addiction, disease, love, death, poverty…all these things I didn’t know anything about.  I thought it couldn’t be that much worse than the shit I was going through.  Then I met Claire and it just changed everything—the dull and distant sadness in her eyes, the way all her body movements seemed defensive and guarded around strangers.  She really changed my life—and my writing too.  I wouldn’t be half of what I am today if she never came into my life.  </p>
<p>About two years ago Claire and I had a kid.  It wasn’t planned, that’s for sure.  We spent a good three weeks at the beginning of her pregnancy deciding what we should do about it.  I wanted to keep it; she wanted to get an abortion.  Who was I to make her keep this thing inside her if she didn’t want it?  </p>
<p>“I just don’t think I’d be a good mother,” She said once, her head emerging from the toilet after vomiting, “Look at us…look at how we live—there’s rats under the floorboards and the heater doesn’t work…can we really bring a child into this shithole?  And how would we afford it?”</p>
<p>“We’ll manage, we always do.”</p>
<p>“Alex…I’m not ready for this kind of thing.”</p>
<p>“It’s up to you, baby.”</p>
<p>“Look at MY parents.  They never did a damn thing for me,”</p>
<p>“They’re only human, Claire…”</p>
<p>“I just don’t want to raise a child that’s only going to end up hating me.”</p>
<p>We decided to give the baby (a beautiful boy) up for adoption.  It was rough.  The pregnancy really changed Claire.  She had to stop drinking, stop smoking, but she didn’t care—she was a different person.  Responsible.  She even stopped stealing from her store.  But in the end the kid needed a fair shake at life—having parents as fucked up as us was no way for him to start.  Some real nice couple from Petaluma took him.  They seemed to have their heads on straight.  He was a doctor and she was a teacher.  He had a gentle smile and she had soft eyes, it was comforting.  As they drove away I saw Claire wipe her face with the sleeve of her shirt—she was crying.  I don’t know if Claire cried often or not…but if she did she sure as hell never let me see it.   That was the first and last time I ever saw her without the armor she always wore.  Without the defensive mechanisms and sarcastic wit.  Her eyes were bloodshot and her sobs were soft and delicate.  I guess Claire was fragile afterall.</p>
<p>She never got back into her old habits after the kid was born.  I guess it’s amiable.  Everyone’s got to grow up a little eventually right?  Those days when she came home at 4 a.m. the smell of vodka and cheap cologne were nowhere to be found: just red eyes and salty cheeks.  She quit her job too, told me the whole grunge “revolution” thing that was going on really made her sick.  I didn’t believe her.  She had outgrown the store, the apartment, the city…me.  The smell of the cool air off the bay creeping through our windows on a brisk autumn day wasn’t enough to keep her there anymore.  I tried everything I could to spark the old flame in her again.  I suggested moving, getting real job, having another kid…nothing.  She didn’t want to do anything.  She was already gone.</p>
<p>So when she finally did leave it didn’t come as much of a shock.  That didn’t make it any easier to bear though.  Coming home one day and seeing empty spaces where her clothes used to hang still felt like a rusty chisel being beat into my chest.  She left all the furniture, all the records…everything but her clothes.  Either because she couldn’t carry them or because she was a sweet sweet loving woman until the end.  I like to pretend it’s the latter.  I sat down in the old brown recliner and wrote what was probably, to this day, the worst attempt at a poem I’ve ever made.  Words couldn’t do justice tohow I felt.  I was never much of a poet, either.  </p>
<p>In the end I moved back to Washington, finished up college and got a teaching degree.  I prefer fucking up someone else’s kids to my own.  I haven’t seen or heard from Claire in…eight years now?  Even if she wanted to contact me or I her it’s not like we could—we both have different lives now.  She could be dead right now for all I know.  I try not to think about her too much, because I’d be lying if I said it didn’t still sting a bit.  But I’m engaged to a sweet woman named Emily now.  She’s smart and fun and has a good heart.  Who knows, we might even have kids.  A tan Volvo with car seats and ice cream stains—I can see it now.  In the end Claire, I wish you luck in finding whatever it is you were looking for.  And just remember that whenever I catch the scent of cheap vodka on a woman’s breath or a belligerent argument about the merits of Nirvana I’ll always think about you.  And to David Weakland of Petaluma CA, good luck in whatever it is you’ve become or are becoming.  Just remember that your father was a bum and your mother was a dreamer—she dreamt she was a bulldozer, she dreamt she was alone in an empty field.  </p>
