<center><b>Sylvia’s Garden</b><br>
By Christopher Dean</center><br><br>

<p>My sister was born four years too early for the cure, her legs twisted for life. Encased in a cripple’s scaffolding. My legs shine in the moonlight. Straight and muscular…</p>
<p>The gazebo’s paint is peeling, and in the slight, summer-night breeze, I can easily imagine myself sitting in a pagoda of ice. Around me are the gardens of my estate—my sister’s gardens, Sylvia’s. The stepping stones among the roses and poppies and lilies are still scratched, dented, from the spurs of her braces, personalized with her signature footstep-scrapings.</p>
<p>She used to kneel and hobble throughout the garden, as a child, and even when we grew up, went to Yale, she still would come back to the estate and tend to the garden. It was our mother’s, before she died from leukemia.</p>
<p>I feel naked, here in the gazebo in my inherited garden. First my mother’s, it passed into Sylvia’s hands. And when my sister died—drunken chauffeur from Czechoslovakia slamming her into a bridge support—the estate and gardens became mine to tend. In the garden where my sister used to play, laughing at me with her handfuls of flowers when I brought her my worms and beetles, tracking muddy footprints across the grimaldi Roma tiles of the back veranda.</p>
<p>A midnight snack gone awry, and Shannon’s gone in sleep, upstairs and beyond any ability to save me from this floral expanse. There’s a pebble hiding in my left slipper, eluding my fingers, and it hurts to walk. </p>
<p>The cheese sandwich I came downstairs for is on the bench beside me, the plate dark under shadow. My knee’s giving me trouble again; too much jogging, yesterday, but I’m forty-seven after all; my waistline’s increasing, metabolism slowing down, and Shannon’s pushing me to begin dieting and to give up coffee.</p><br><br>

<p>When we were children, Dad would come home from the Capitol on weekends and talk to us about our week. He’d watch us play in the gardens and when we were thirsty hand us our refreshments (he liked to do it instead of our nannies) and laugh at us.</p>
<p>When Dad would call us in from our adventures with daffodils and grasshoppers under the afternoon sun, our dirt-encrusted fingers would invariably spill some milk or juice or maybe plain water. I remember how we laughed and let the hounds clean it up, and how Sylvia and I giggled at the sight of them, all three jostling and frantically licking the tile.</p>
<p>I remember how nice it was to hear my sister talk, to hear someone speak without mentioning The Hill, someone who didn’t understand what a fiscal year was; she could tell me everything about anything she came across in the garden or in the street, and explain to me what Daddy was talking about with his friends in suits. She’d make up stories about why men in ties and jackets followed my father every time we went somewhere, or explain big words like “treaty” and “legislature.”</p>
<p>The tiles have turned white, stained by the moonlight a strange translucent blue. The hounds are gone, sleeping in their kennel. And I can still see Sylvia digging in the garden, her bright orange bangs falling above her freckled face. I…</p><br><br>

<p>Tonight’s party was gorgeous; orange and buttery light had filled the Samuel Robert McLain Hall, and our various cocktails clinked thousands of toasts, out of tune but enjoyable. Shannon laughed and talked perfectly; made jokes with John Mulciber and his wife Margaret, delighted the delegation from Kyoto, and generally played well her role of Attorney General’s Wife.</p>
<p>And she helped me out of that hallway after they held a toast to Sylvia, to the great political clan of the Lynches. Mulciber, the show-off that he is, taking the initiative.</p>
<p>“To the great, late, Senator Sylvia Vivian Lynch. Her work with normalizing relations with China and North Korean, her efforts to bring out effective medical aid to the nation’s children, and her great sense of trust, hope, generosity, humanitarianism—in short, all the traits that make our great nation so wonderful—in memory of that fine woman, let us…”</p>
<p>On and on they droned, talking about her dedication and spirit and kind-heartedness. I had to sit there all night, listening to these praises of her accomplishments and the obstacles she overstepped. She always got the attention, especially because of her condition. I got so wrapped up in my jealousy, I know I must have shouted when I pulled Shannon close, demanded we leave on a presumed emergency, and let her yank me from the hall into the freezing New York air.</p>
<p>Driving back to the estate, we said nothing.</p><br><br>

<p>“Here, Daddy, they’re pretty and blue, like Mommy’s favorite, for when she gets home, Daddy! She’ll be happy I got these for her, won’t she, Daddy? For her? Daddy? Daddy!” I loved the sounds of her braces’ clicking as she hobbled down the gravel path, the dogs chasing her happily. I was barely three, and could hardly follow. But I still remember that day when Mom died.</p>
<p>Dad told us what had happened, in a far-away place called Munich with cancer? That was the first time I’d ever seen Dad cry, kneeling with Sylvia, her concerned arms around his neck. Too young to comprehend what it meant, I was confused, but I hugged him anyway.</p>
<p>Dad kept the flowers in a vase on his dresser.</p>
<p>My sister was a thing of beauty, despite the braces. All the most expensive ones possible, the best, nothing but, for the daughter of California Senator Jonathan Lynch.</p>
<p>And God still took her.</p>
<p>Where was God when she died? Where was God when I had to identify my sister’s corpse to the mortician? The hand that held mine when we went to church, the hands that lay a crushed mass of violets on Mom’s coffin: hands scarred black and red by the flames. I can’t forget Sylvia’s already imperfect broken body, laid out in the ambulance. Black, splintered face…</p>
<p>My cripple sister, crucified in flames.</p>
<p>God…</p>
<p>She grew into the star, out of us. Yale Salutatorian of her year. International, really, U.S. ambassador to Japan, then to the U.N., and then the Senate. Everybody loved and praised her, and our story was constantly cited as the reason for her selflessness, her resolute sympathy to the unfortunate, her unswerving drive to excel. I stayed quite, the bastardized sibling, kept busy for years, behind her and out of the light, as New York Attorney General. Until her death, I was kept a nobody, self-imposed exile. And the media made me their darling, their poor martyr.</p>
<p>I was never jealous of her, I’m sure.</p><br><br>

<p>But if I loved her so much, why am I sitting here, why aren’t I still in the Hall trading jokes with McDonald and Ambassador Tsubasa and Jenny, drinking the free-flowing champagne?</p>
<p>I hate functions honoring my dead family. I could shoot myself anytime, and continue the legacy of the dead. But I hate the Kennedy comparisons, and it would only further them, if I were to die prematurely. Would only bring Shannon and the kids under closer scrutiny.</p>
<p>They like to flash old family photos of us, Dad being tall and lean and solemn, with me a miniature of his tree-trunk frame. And next to us would be the dazzling mask of my sister’s smile, bringing feelings of good cheer to those friends who pay lip-service to my grief.</p><br><br>

<p>“Joshua…”</p>
<p>The memory of my sister in the garden around me, around this post I lean my head against, bent over the tulips, the way she did before some drunken Czech driver robbed her from me, à la Princess Diana. Sylvia was beautiful to me before the coming of the hordes of shadow-eyed men who slumped their shoulders before turning to one another, agitated, glancing towards me with fear in their eyes. They knew about the Attorney General’s famous dead mother.</p>
<p>They were the same looks they gave me and Dad when Mom died. I was barely three, and I already knew what their looks meant.</p>
<p>I hated them all.</p>
<p>They’re a blur: all the friends who come to offer fake pity at my loss—let them lose their family, and tell me they understand! Let them learn that there is no justice, no worth, no God! They call us the New Kennedys, the newest clan of tragic heroes. But I won’t let them do that again, I won’t let them have their way with Sylvia’s memories…</p><br><br>

<p>The kitchen window is lit against the night—I’ve left the lamp on, and the peanut butter needs to be put away, back in the fridge.</p>
<p>So I get up to return to bed, to go and clean up the kitchen find Shannon’s warm back under the sheets. But that damned pebble still annoys, and when I bend over to fish it out, I find myself toppling into a patch of rhododendrons. And my shoulder connects with one of the stepping stones, scratched and pockmarked with her braces’ heels. Cursing the stones, I start to get up, to pull myself from the dirt, before I notice the tiny shard of Japanese fiber-spun carbon polymer, broken off in one of the stone’s indentations. A last signature of presence from her. A last token of her ownership of this garden. Holding this black nub, knowing it will go into a sealed envelope in my writing desk, I limp back to bed and sleep.</p>
