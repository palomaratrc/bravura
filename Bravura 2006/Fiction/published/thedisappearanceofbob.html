<center><b>The Disappearance of Bob McCready</b><br>
Mary Charles</center><br><br>

<p>We all know that water seeps into the desert sand. But this was ridiculous. Bob had disappeared.</p>
<p>Scanning our town's bimonthly newspaper, The Curious Lizard, my eye caught the article:  "Bob McCready traveled almost 3,000 miles from Boston to Desert Crossing on March 31 to experience the spring wildflowers. Now the 54-year-old man seems to have been swallowed up by the desert he came to see.”</p>
<p>Putting the paper aside for a moment, I reflected upon the positives in my life: lov¬ing parents, caring friends, good health, and memorable students. But the negatives—growing, rising like a termite hill—had begun to consume. Twenty-seven years, twenty-seven very very long years - same school, same grade, same Language Arts curriculum, same classroom, same boyfriend, who refused to commit. It was Harry Fiske, our principal at Elliott Junior High School in Pasadena, who suggested that I ~ for a sabbatical leave. I jumped at the chance to heal my troubled soul, to get in touch with my inner self, to renew my creative juices.</p>
<p>Scouting around for a small town off the beaten path, I had discovered Desert Crossing quite by chance. This little town and I were perfectly suited. Insulated from the out-side world: no electric stop lights, fast food restaurants, movie theaters, just one main drag with two tiny shopping centers, "The Mall" and "The Center". Population 2,893, swelling to a winter 6,000- "snowbirds" flocking for warm climes, but fleeing when temperatures be¬gan to soar. Surrounded by jagged mountains, Desert Crossing became my sanctuary.</p>
<p>I took a sip of Amaretto flavored coffee and continued to read the article. </p>
<p>"Sheriff Tom French said McCready left a Journal in the abandoned rental car, but it gave no hint of where he was going or what could have happened to him. He took notes as he waited to take off from Logan Airport, watched "Good Will Hunting" on the flight, sighted a roadrunner in Desert Crossing and had minimal food expenses.”</p>
<p>Quickly scanning the rest of the article, I noticed the name Susan. Susan, that name rang a bell! My old college chum moved to Boston after graduation and married Bob McCready.</p>
<p>I put my coffee cup down and considered: How would I feel if a loved one had sim¬ply vanished? What would I do? Not a single clue left behind - except the square-one clue of the car in the parking lot. With plenty of time on my hands and a certain fondness for puzzlers, T. V. mystery programs and Who-Done-It books, I made a decision. I was go¬ing to try to find Bob McCready.</p>
<p>Armed with a tape recorder, my Good Samaritan attitude, and a sleuth's dogged-ness, I decided to help his family in need and in the process, also, help me overcome my personal frustrations. McCready's last journal entry showed that he had stopped at 9:30 A.M. for breakfast at The Coffee 'n Bun. Perhaps Diana Simmons, the owner, might be able to fill in some of the missing pieces.</p>
<p>Diana smiled and asked how I was. It was so unlike her, usually some curt remark. I explained the purpose of my visit, placed my tape recorder on the counter, and pushed the start button.</p>
<p>Hesitantly she began, "He asked if he could take my picture for his journal. Wanted to post it on the Internet. Used one of those new high tech digital cameras." She paused, "He wanted to know where to see the wildflowers. As we talked, he ate one of my freshly baked pecan rolls. Well, he finished his roll, then paid for a muffin. Said something about snacking on it later."</p>
<p>As I neared the door, Diana shouted, "Barbara, did you hear about that man they found wandering up in the canyon? Looked like your guy, but it was someone else."</p>
<p>The next day I went to interview Big Bill who works at Desert Crossing's only liquor store. Big Bill, a name that suited him well - big belly protruding over his belt buckle, lots of jokes, fount of town gossip. </p>
<p>Placing the tape recorder on the counter, I posed the identical question, "What do you think happened to Bob McCready?" </p>
<p>After telling me the same old shopworn political jokes he began, "That fella came in here. Wanted to know how to get to Palm Canyon. I pointed up Palm Canyon Drive. Told him it's kinda hot today. Bet¬ter take some water. He bought a bottle, climbed into a shiny blue Pontiac Spitfire, and took oft."</p>
<p>I tried again. "Well, Bill, what do you think really happened to him?”</p>
<p>"How the hell, do I know. Maybe a mountain lion got him."</p>
<p>I mulled this possibility in my mind. It didn't fit. Search volunteers had traveled up the length of the canyon - arms extended straight out from their sides, walking about 5 feet apart, covering every rock and crevice. A mountain lion wouldn't devour a digital camera, a backpack.</p>
<p>I sensed a close presence in my space, a tiny nudge. Daryl, one of the town's char¬acters... Erect posture, handsome, a former Green Beret. Lives in a tiny trailer set well back on a small dirt used car lot - just two or three cars belonging to senior citizens, too old to drive them. "Daryl, what do you know about the fella that disappeared up Palm Canyon?"</p>
<p>He didn't have a clue. But, answered with a completely oft base comment, "All poli¬ticians are the same," and then offered me a cigarette.</p>
<p>Leaving this guy, I dashed across Palm Canyon Drive to the other shopping center, cleverly named "The Mall". Something in The Curious Lizard article had piqued my inter¬est:  “The scent went up the trail for a while, then stopped."</p>
<p>I needed to know why the tracking dogs had lost McCready's scent a possible clue to Bob's whereabouts. An "Out to lunch" sign stuck to the door of our local sheriffs' storefront office caught my eye. No one was there, so I'd have to schedule an appointment with Sheriff French at a later date.</p>
<p>Enough sleuthing for one day. Hunger pains drove me to the Desert Deli. Fred, an¬other town old timer, was seated in front of the Deli. Happily retired from his job as a bar¬tender at the only private golf club in town, he planned to spend his remaining days in Desert Crossing. But, his wife pictured their life differently. He used to tell me, "Love this little town. If the wife's not happy here, she can go over the mountains without me."</p>
<p>I began, "Fred, I'm trying to figure out what happened to that fellow who disap¬peared hiking up Palm Canyon. Got any ideas?"</p>
<p>"Maybe went over the hill." He paused, "Speak to the Mrs. Know where she's at?" Glancing toward the towering mountains he muttered, "Over that dang mountain."</p>
<p>The next morning I awoke to the sound of chirping birds and fresh desert smells. I brewed a fresh cup of coffee, munched on a banana nut muffin, and set out to interview UI, the owner of the town's only video store. In my haste to get out of the heat, I tripped over a cement block in the parking lot. Damn, my clumsiness, sure don't need another broken arm. When I regained my footing, I noticed two fellas slowly marching lock step, "robots" in black. The older of the two hair slicked back, the younger - black cap, black small wrap around glasses, black jacket, black gloves. Strange attire for these desert temperatures. Observed that neither bore any resemblance to the missing McCready, just two more of our local town characters. ... fodder for a possible creative writing story.</p>
<p>I paused to read the flyer taped to the door of the Desert Video store. "Have you see this missing man? Bob McCready, hometown - Boston, Massachusetts, 5' 6", 150-155 pounds, shaggy beard, brown eyes, very nearsighted, strong under bite. May be carrying a red backpack or a digital camera."</p>
<p>Lil, proprietor of Desert Video, used to handle merchandise from the Sears catalog and carry a few video rentals as a convenience for the locals. When the catalog store became a relic, she became the town's full service store - video rentals, Xerox copies, faxes, greeting cards, tickets to the town's artistic endeavors, and for the few who knew, porno flicks. In one of our many conversations, she confessed that she secretly harbored a desire to chuck it all, head to Broadway, become a stage actress. Now she had to satisfy her theatrical bent by appearing in bit parts at the town's Performing Arts Center.</p>
<p>"Lil, what do you think happened to that guy, McCready?"</p>
<p>She began, "Strangest thing, right after the disappearance, I was sitting on my porch watching the sunset. A yellow cab comes speeding down the dirt road. Turns into that dead end behind my house, spins around and heads out toward Lazy S Road."</p>
<p>I thought a speeding Yellow Cab, two hours from the nearest fair sized city. Never have seen one of these here. "Have you shared this information with the sheriffs' office?"</p>
<p>Lil didn't answer my question, but continued, "Heard that his brother's in town, staying over at the Whispering Sands motel. You might speak to him."</p>
<p>The next day I decided to follow up on Lil's suggestion. Steering wheel hot to touch, air conditioner blasting, I took the short drive to the Whispering Sands motel. A slight man with an untidy beard, bearing a close resemblance to the photo of his missing brother, answered the door. I identified myself and told him I had read the article about his brother, Bob. Shared that I didn't want to intrude in his family's misery. "But I'm a good listener," I said. "Maybe talking about Bob and your family will help."</p>
<p>"My wife's resting. Let's go sit out by the pool."	</p>
<p>Slumping in a pool side chair, he began, "You're right, I do need to talk to someone. It doesn't fit. Bob's a gentle, friendly, inquisitive man,... almost a Mr. Rogers. He wearily continued, "He and Susan had so much to look forward to, their wedding anniversary and his twenty five years at Boston U. Staring distractedly across the pool, "He's so proud of his two kids, Meagan and Tad. They're both doing so well at Georgetown University" He repeated again, "It's not like Bob. It just doesn't fit. He and Susan had planned a special trip to Washington D. C. to pick up the kids. Then the four of them were going to visit the historical sites."</p>
<p>He shook his head, "no sense. It's almost like Bob's just on vacation." Glancing my way for the first time during our pool side talk, "Did I tell you that Bob was an Eagle Scout? His family spent their summers in the Adirondack Mountains. He knows the out-of-doors."  He took a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his brow.  “Is it always this hot and dry here ?”</p>
<p>I considered this question. Had Bob adequately prepared for a day hike in our harsh desert environment? ... plenty of water, light weight clothing, a map of the area. I said good-bye, expressing the hope that our conversation had helped in some small way. Looking back, I observed the dejected man seated by the pool, a look of pain and suffer¬ing on his face.</p>
<p>My next move was over to the Zany Coyote bar and restaurant for a dinner date with Daisy. Daisy, always good for a laugh, a funny political aside, a lively discussion She had recently returned from a ten day volunteer effort in Costa Rica studying the mating habits of some obscure bird. It seems the dominant bird gets all the action, while the other male just observes. "Kinky" sex in the bird world.</p>
<p>Daisy wasn't there yet, so I joined George and Sally at the bar. Sally, a dog - an Asta look alike - was seated on a barstool, head cocked, seeming to join in our conversa¬tion. George volunteered, "You know the guy that disappeared. I know what happened to him. Probably been planning his escape for months. Surfed the Net, found this little burg, arranged for a friend to meet him, skipped to Mexico. Probably a lover."</p>
<p>Daisy's arrival saved me from attempting a response. We were seated at our usual reserved table with views of tall palm trees, distant varicolored mountains, and Fly Catcher birds darting about catching dinner. On their menu, flies.</p>
<p>Sipping my Merlot, I started to tell Daisy about my conundrum. She looked at me and laughingly said, "Probably he's sunbathing on the beach at Acapulco with a gorgeous dark haired younger woman, or maybe two."</p>
<p>I relaxed in my chair, took another sip of Merlot, and thought, "Now I have this guy's M.O. He stashed some cash, searched the net for some isolated community, arranged for transportation - that Yellow Cab - fled the country, ditched his wife for another woman.</p>
<p>Scorching temperatures, rising humidity, approaching August storms...</p>
<p>I stopped at the Post Office - bills, junk mail, post office box renewal notice, a letter from my school. I tore open the envelope and quickly scanned the missive. Welcome Back... September 9... first teacher in-service. It was already July 24th, and I still hadn't a clue as to the whereabouts of McCready. But, on the plus side, my own personal demons were slowly being conquered. I'd called my, soon to be, ex-boy friend Trevor, told him that our lives had been slowly moving in different directions. Abruptly, I ended the conversation, slammed down the phone, treated myself to a tall vodka tonic, and recalled the words to that song, "I'm gonna wash that man right out of my hair."</p>
<p>"Fasten your seat belts..."  So I'm off to Boston. Maybe Susan McCready can help fill in the missing blanks.</p>
<p>Apprehensively, I approached the McCready home - a trim home set back from the street, the front yard a riot of colorful blooms. A short, plump woman, a sad look about her, answered the door. She looked startled and said, "My God is that you Barbara, Barbara Symthe? Why are you here?"</p>
<p>"I'm in Boston attending a creative writing workshop and on the spur of the moment decided to visit you. Susan, it's been years since we last chatted. When you left UCLA and moved east our paths parted. A few letters, a Christmas card or two... Do you mind if I come in?"</p>
<p>She invited me in. After I settled down in a living room chair, she asked, "Would you care for a cup of tea? While she was out brewing the tea, I thought how could I tell her about Bob. She returned with the tea. I made small talk - the weather, the airplane flight, the writing workshop, my interest in gardening. I commented on her colorful blooms.</p>
<p>She seemed to feel more at ease as the two of us chuckled as we recalled how we often got into trouble in the sorority house.</p>
<p>"Susan, do you remember how our house mother got so upset when she found the beer we hid in the toilet tank downstairs?"</p>
<p>"Sure do, but Barbara it was your fault we got locked out of the sorority house cause we partied too late? Thank goodness you had that old clunker of a car and we could sleep in it.”</p>
<p>I paused and considered my next comment very carefully. "I now live in Desert Crossing and read about your husband in our local paper."</p>
<p>Pulling a Kleenex from her pocket she dabbed at her eyes and asked, "Why? Where is he? It was just a short business trip."</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry, but perhaps I can be of some help." Then I filled her in on my efforts so far. I, also, told her how and why I had gotten so involved in his strange disappearance.</p>
<p>"Susan, did Bob have a computer? If he did, perhaps we could find out more about his trip."</p>
<p>"A computer, why yes, he seemed to love that computer more'n me. 'Course I guess you'd say I'm not computer literate. Do you have a computer?" I nodded yes and she brightened up. "Would you like to see his?" She led my down a long narrow dark hall¬way to his office at the rear of the house, the door tightly dosed. "Never go in there much. Bob said it's kind of his retreat from the world's problems."</p>
<p>I wandered into his office. Stacks of computer manuals, travel books, horticultural books, lined the walls, spilling across his desk and onto the floor. Seemed to tend his gar¬den with more care than his office. "Mind if I use his computer?" I inquired.</p>
<p>"Well", she paused and fidgeted with her necklace. "Oh, all right. Just be very very careful when you use it."</p>
<p>A photo of the family as a screen-saver caught my eye, good-looking kids. Scanned the documents list, then discovered a floppy disk file stashed behind some books. Hmmm, a disk with phone numbers - mainly male names in the Boston area. Checked his e-mail "address book". Something caught my eye, a phone number with a San Diego area code. San Diego.... a 2-hour drive from Desert Crossing! I jotted down the number on My-Things-to-Do-list.</p>
<p>Returning to the living room I drank another cup of tea and sampled one of Susan's delicious chocolate cookies.</p>
<p>Susan asked, "Did you find anything on Bob's computer that may help me?"</p>
<p>"No, just some work information and digital pictures of trips that you two have taken.  Looks like he uses his computer mostly to play games."</p>
<p>When I rose to leave I instinctively hugged Susan, left her my phone numbers in both Desert Crossing and Pasadena, and told her to please keep in touch. After returning my rental car, I purchased a crossword puzzle book for my return flight to Lindbergh in San Diego.</p>
<p>Back at my apartment I did a Yahoo search and found that the email address was a hospice in San Diego. I picked up the phone and called. "Was Mr. McCready still there?" I inquired. He was and, yes, I could visit him.</p>
<p>The next morning I jumped in my car and drove over the mountain. All the time wondering what I would say. Was I being too nosy?</p>
<p>I recognized him immediately, sitting by the window, a patchwork Afghan covering his spindly legs and now his face with a deathly pallor. "Mr. McCready, I've been looking for you. I live in Desert Crossing and knew your wife in college. Your family is concerned about you."</p>
<p>He began to spill his tale. For the past eight years he'd been involved with men. His family didn't know - kind of his secret life. Then the diagnosis - AIDS - the disease gradually sapping his strength. He had to get away. He'd planned his own disappearance because he didn't want his family to suffer. The naked anguish in his face, "Please don't tell them."</p>
<p>I promised to keep his secret. But, as I stood up to leave, "Bob, you obviously love your family very much. Please consider their feelings, their hurts. Is it fair for them to be left wondering what happened to you? ... To never know?" I left the hospice, returned to Desert Crossing, with the memories of that frail man lingering on my mind.</p>
<p>So many sleepless nights .... Would I honor Bob's request?</p>
<p>One month into the school term. Things were definitely on the up swing - a group of highly motivated bright students and John, the new Math teacher. Two dinner dates with him, and I'd begun to feel our relationship had possibilities. John made me feel special. So, unlike that other jerk, Trevor   all those wasted years!</p>
<p>The phone rang. Could it be John? Quickly I picked up the phone. "Hello, this is George McCready. Do you remember me?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, George. I do." Visions of this distraught man seated by the pool flitted through my mind.</p>
<p>He continued, "You were so kind to spend a few moments with me. I thought you'd like to know. Bob passed away last week. But just before he died, he called and spoke to all of us. He told us about your visit, your caring concern, your promise to keep his secret. Your visit got him to thinking about the family. Made him realize how devastating it must be to the living - to be left in limbo, never knowing, always wondering. Thanks from all of us.',</p>
<p>I hung up the phone. "Now I can sleep."</p>
