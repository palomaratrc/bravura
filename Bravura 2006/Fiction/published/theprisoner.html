<center><b>The Prisoner</b><br>
<i>Second Place Winner, Fiction</i><br>
By Christie M. Franke</center><br><br>

<p><i>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten… one, two, three, four, five-</i></p><br><br>

<p>They were opening his door. He immediately pressed himself against the wall; curled up in the corner, he made a smaller target. The guards liked to beat the prisoners when they were bored, and he was popular for that sport. Perhaps if he was silent and did not move, they would not punish him. Silent, silent, he must be silent. <i>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven-</i></p>
<p>“Hey you! Wake up!”</p>
<p>He put his hands over his eyes, shaking, dreading the blows to come, and yet expecting them with the utter despair of those long used to torment. He would not scream this time. He would not let them see how much they hurt him with their whips and their rocks and their hot irons. This time he would bear it in silence. <i>One, two, three, four-</i></p>
<p>“Hey! Wake up! Don’t you want to see who’s come for you? Hey!”</p>
<p>He hissed as a steel-toed boot swung into his side. <i>–eight, nine-</i></p>
<p>“Please Mr. Sykes, let me collect him. Perhaps he’ll answer me.”</p>
<p>Whose was that voice? His head shot up and he peered through his fingers and lank, dirty hair at the angel who knelt before him. What was she doing here, in a place like this? She was clean and pure in a cream-colored dress and blue coat. What color was that coat, he wondered dizzily. Peacock blue? That was it. He thought he would die of the shock of seeing her again. Surely this was a dream?</p>
<p>“Nathan,” she said, and her voice was like music. She held out her hand, reaching for him. “Will you come with me?”</p>
<p>Beyond her he could see the tall Mr. Sykes, glaring at him with the usual hatred. He pressed himself closer to the wall, curling in tighter. No. He had been tortured enough. He covered his face with his hands and moaned softly, pain lancing through him as sharp as any knife. Why wouldn’t they just kill him? It would be so much easier just to die. But the thought of leaving the nightmares in his own head once and for all was dizzying; he pushed it away and sought to merely exist. And still, the angel knelt before him. </p>
<p><i>One, two, three, four, five-</i></p>
<p>“Nathan,” she said again, her voice a coaxing whisper. “Will you at least look at me? Please Nathan.”</p>
<p>“He’s mad, miss. They all are here. The darkness and guilt makes them go into their heads until they’re all raving lunatics,” Sykes said.</p>
<p>The angel seemed annoyed, for through his fingers he saw her turn sharply to the warden. “And no doubt also because of the physical trauma inflicted upon them. I saw how you kicked him when we came in. Leave us be, thank you.”</p>
<p>For a moment he looked at her in pure amazement. Nobody talked to Sykes like that. Her voice was angry; he wondered what he had done. He was so sorry, oh so sorry for everything. How much pain would there be before he was forgiven? There had been the weekly night of the hot irons, from which he bore scars and burns, and the regular, sometimes daily beatings. But that was nothing compared to the pain of hearing that voice again, the voice that forced him to remember all he had lost.</p>
<p>The angel was speaking again, her hand still held out. “Nathan? All you have to do is take my hand. I’m here to take you home, Nathan. Won’t you understand that?”</p>
<p><i>Home.</i> Home? Take him home? He thought he remembered what home was; it was love and laughter and happiness, it was not being afraid because of the people who surrounded you. But that was gone; there was only darkness left behind. </p>
<p>“I have no home.”</p>
<p>He had not meant to speak, and pressed himself closer to the wall, certain that he would be beaten now. He cringed away from it like a dog. </p>
<p>“No home? Yes, you do,” she replied, startled but firm.</p>
<p>He shook his head; didn’t she understand? He tried again, his voice harsh and croaking from lack of use. “I lost them all. Even the smallest one.”</p>
<p>He raised his eyes and looked at her through his matted hair. Her eyes caught his and held them, and they were full of tears. </p>
<p>“Oh. Oh, Nathan. No, you didn’t lose them. You couldn’t help what happened. Come on, Nathan, let’s go home. You’re safe now.”</p>
<p>Safe? It was impossible. He bit down hard on his knuckle, hoping that the physical pain it caused would lessen the pain inside. The angel put her hand on his knee, her touch light as a petal. He rocked back and forth, holding the jet of misery back to keep it from springing forth and consuming him utterly, but he could feel it rising like an inexorable wave. <i>One, two, three, four</i>…If he kept counting, he could keep the misery at bay…<i>five, six</i>… </p>
<p>“Nathan?”</p>
<p>“…seven, eight, nine, ten! One, two, three…”</p>
<p>“It’s not your fault, Nathan, it was an accident! No one could have known it would happen! The judge looked at the case again and saw that it was an honest accident.”</p>
<p>“…four, five, six…!”</p>
<p>“They’re letting you go with a full pardon, Nathan, don’t you understand?”</p>
<p>“…Seven, eight, nine, ten!”</p>
<p>He screamed. The roaring misery would not be held back any longer; it pushed past his meager defenses and gushed forth to consume him. Five years of grief and guilt and fear burst forth, and he screamed again from the pain of it all. Innocent, yes, and he had known it all along. But he could have saved them. He could have saved them all. He put his hands over his face and howled his misery again.</p>
<p>The angel withdrew her hand and did not touch him again, rightly guessing that she had forced him to see the truth. And yet, the moment her hand withdrew, he wept. He could not bear to have lost her again; now the pain was so great he knew he would die of it. He wept great wracking sobs, tears pouring down his face and soaking his beard and tattered shirt.</p>
<p>“Please, please don’t leave me. I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, I can’t…please help me, please don’t leave me!”</p>
<p>He dared to look up at her and saw that her eyes were over-bright with unshed tears. She wordlessly held her hand out to him, the simple gesture conveying more to him than words ever could. His tears slowed and stilled, and his sobbing breath slowed to quiet gasps. After staring at it for several long moments, still unsure if this was safe, he reached out and gingerly took her slender white hand. Her fingers closed around his as she smiled at him.</p>
<p>“Good. That’s very good, Nathan. Can you stand?” She was already rising. He unsteadily climbed to his feet, swaying and cowering like a timid animal, and sending fearful glances towards Sykes.</p>
<p>“Mr. Sykes will not harm you,” the angel said firmly, wrapping one arm about his waist. “Lean on me, Nathan; that’s it. Let’s go.” </p>
<p>She smelled like lavender and fresh air, he thought dizzily as he was propelled from the room. The angel-did he dare even think her name? - wrapped a long coat around him like a blanket, and he clutched it to him like a lifeline, feeling the warmth of the soft wool soak into his skin. He did not dare to let go. Perhaps if he did, they would make him go back to that wretched little cell. He could not bear the thought.  Not when she had her arm around him and was leading him out of this hell. </p>
<p>She led him out of the cell, past Sykes. The man glowered at him, and he shrunk against her in terror. The angel murmured soothing little phrases, her arm tight around his waist. They moved quickly, and he did not look back at the hellish place he had lived in for the past five years. They walked for a long time through the building, past the interrogation rooms where so much pain had been meted out to him because of his crimes, past the wardens’ offices, and finally out the iron-barred front doors into the cold night air. The wind bit at his face, but he breathed it in deeply, sucking it into his lungs, unable to believe that there was still fresh air in the world. The angel squeezed his hand as they walked down the front steps.</p>
<p>“You’re safe,” she murmured into his ear, breath warm on his skin. “I swear it on my life.”</p>
<p>And then they climbed into a car and were moving fast. It was all dark, so dark, and his heart pounded with terror as they drove along the silent streets. What if this was just a dream? He had had dreams like this before, but this one was so real that he knew he would die if he woke up back there. <i>Oh please, oh please, oh please…</i></p>
<p>At last, they stopped. He looked up at a large building that was strangely, desperately familiar to him. He gazed out the window at it apprehensively; was it another place of torture? Perhaps not, but the memories would be painful enough.  </p>
<p>“Come,” she said, and climbed out of the car. He followed, his movements still uncertain, limping and fearful. He was almost able to think of her by name now.</p>
<p>She led him into the building, one arm wrapped firmly around him in support, past the doorman he did not recognize and towards the lift. It was a new lift; he saw the year inscribed in the brass plate beside the door: 1923. Yes, it really had been five years. He closed his eyes and tried to keep his rising hysteria down. Safe, he was safe, he was safe…</p>
<p>At last the lift stopped and the angel led him onto a landing. There was a door there, painted dark blue with a gold number on it. He stared at her long musicians hands as she unlocked the door and led him inside. The door shut behind them and they were alone in the flat. </p>
<p>“Here, come with me,” the angel said, taking off her coat and tossing it over the back of a nearby sofa. “Let’s get you cleaned up.”</p>
<p>He followed her, staring around the flat in wonder. There were books everywhere, and paintings on the walls, and sheet music scattered around the piano. It was warm and utterly comfortable here, and he again felt a desperate stab of fear that he was dreaming. <i>Please don’t let this be a dream. Please. </i></p>
<p>She led him into a large bathroom. He caught sight of himself in the mirror, and stood staring in repulsed horror.</p>
<p>The man staring back at him was skinny, gaunt, with wild and terror-filled eyes. He had a lot of lank, filthy dark hair and a ragged beard, and the rags he wore under her overcoat would not have kept him alive outside. And he was utterly filthy. Years of dirt were caked into his skin, and he felt a sudden sense of absolute shame that she should see him like this. He knew that he was filthy, had known for ages, but the knowledge did nothing to relieve the feeling. </p>
<p>She was starting a bath. He tore his gaze from the devastated man in the mirror and looked at her. </p>
<p>“Nathan, are you all right?” she asked, gazing at him with worried eyes. </p>
<p>“I-I-why are you doing this for me?” he asked hysterically. The welling of grief and guilt was rising again, and he felt his throat constrict. </p>
<p>The angel blinked back tears as she put her hands up to cup his face. “Do you not know, Nate? It’s because I love you.”</p>
<p>The pain surfaced and consumed him again, but only a single tear escaped his eyes to wet her hand. She brushed it away gently and kissed his cheek, mindless of the dirt. She gestured towards the bath, which was full and steaming. “Get in.”</p>
<p>He hesitated for a moment, then dropped the overcoat and began stripping off his stinking rags. If this was a dream, and he was beginning to think it was not, than he would get clean. Maybe then he would be at least partially worthy of her. </p>
<p>There was soap next to the tub, for the body and the hair, and for a long while he lost himself in the simple pleasure of bathing. It was wonderful. The layers of dirt peeled away from him and made the water black, so she emptied the tub and refilled it with clean water, and he scrubbed again. They repeated this cycle several times, until at last he was clean and raw. When the water no longer became black from the filth of the prison, the angel tipped his head back and scrubbed his long hair, combing it and killing the crawling things with a special soap, then trimming it to a manageable length while he sat in the warm water. She pulled her dress up and stuck her legs into the bath with him as she worked, and he raised one hand and ran a finger along her foot slowly, like he had done so many years ago. He felt her drop a kiss on his neck. </p>
<p>When she had finished with his hair, she gave him a mirror and a razor, and lathered his face for him so that he could shave. He did so, each swipe of the razor against his skin clearing away hair that had been there for years. It was bliss.  </p>
<p>She talked to him all the while, soothing words that told him he was safe and loved, and that he really was free. She talked about her life these past five years, and the work she did at the grand opera house, singing and teaching. He listened intently, drinking in the musical sound of her voice. </p>
<p>“There,” she said at last, wrapping a towel around him as he rose from the bath. “Good as new!”</p>
<p>He tried to smile, but it was fleeting. He had not said a word to her since he had asked why she was doing this. </p>
<p>The scars on his body shocked her; he could see it in her eyes when she looked at him. There was medicine to put on his back, though, which eased the pain of his latest injuries. He leaned against the counter as she rubbed the ointment in, feeling the muscles in his neck and shoulders relax even more than they had in the bath. He felt lighter than he had in ages, a lightness that was almost dizzying. She rubbed her hand over his back one last time, gliding her fingers over his neck so that he shivered.  He dressed in the soft new clothes she gave him reluctantly, wishing that she would continue her ministrations, and she wrapped him in a warm blue robe. </p>
<p>“There,” she murmured again, smoothing his damp hair back and resting her hands on his shoulders. “There, that’s much better. Now, Nathan, please look at me.”</p>
<p>He looked at her, and her blue eyes caught his and held them. “Nathan,” she said gently. “Who am I, and how am I related to you?”</p>
<p>She asked him the question, he knew, to learn the state of his mental health. His throat constricted and made it difficult to breathe. He had thrust her from his head while in the prison because of the painful memories, and he was not sure that he dared to call her by name, even now. But her eyes were gently insistent, and he wracked his memory. He would do anything for her. </p>
<p>“I-you…” he stopped, choking back his grief. How long until it would leave him? She nodded encouragingly. “You are Audrey. You are my wife,” he whispered, tears brimming in his eyes.</p>
<p>There were tears in Audrey’s eyes too as she nodded. “Yes, I am. Tell me who you are.”</p>
<p>It was easier now, though he still felt overwhelmed. A reckless desire started to rise in his heart, threatening to overwhelm him with its power, and yet it made a lump in his throat that was difficult to speak around. “I am Nathan Blythe. I was imprisoned for a murder that I did not commit.” There it was, the memory of his friends and superior officers dying in the car accident that he had not been able to prevent. He remembered the pain of being thrown violently from the car, and he remembered their screams as they went over the cliff edge. A court of law had convicted him of leaping from the vehicle and letting them die. The courts had still been reeling from the aftermath of the war, and he had been imprisoned with no more than a rudimentary trial and no witnesses. Audrey had not been allowed to attend the trial. He had not seen her for four months before they imprisoned him, and for five long years after that. He had been given no news of her after his imprisonment, no matter how much he had begged. He had been given over to torture and abuse, and had thought he would never see her again. </p>
<p>A great scream rose in Nathan’s throat, and he buried his face in his hands. Any moment now it would burst forth and he would not be able to stop it. Audrey put her arms around him and drew him close, and he pressed his face to her neck as the first sob left him. He clung to her desperately, weeping so hard it hurt. Audrey stroked his back, his hair, and kissed his face gently as his hot tears soaked her dress. There were no words to be said, not anymore. </p>
<p>At last the storm ended, as all storms must, and Nathan stood limply with his face pressed to her neck, emotionally drained. Audrey rubbed his back in slow, soothing circles and he leaned into her touch, breathing in her scent. She looked up at him, blue eyes gazing into green. </p>
<p>“There,” she whispered. “That’s better, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>He smiled at her, a quick upward quirk of the lip. He knew it would be a long time before anything was fully better, and that he had years of healing to endure before the scars on his spirit faded, but yes, at the moment he was feeling a little better. </p>
<p>“Don’t you want to know the best news, love?” she whispered, laughter and sympathy in her voice. </p>
<p>He straightened up and looked at her quizzically, raising an eyebrow. “What? What is the best news?”</p>
<p>Audrey gave him a shy smile, but there was joy in her eyes. “I had our baby after you were taken. She’s almost five years old now. I couldn’t get my letters through to you, to tell you. Her name is Emma.”</p>
<p>Nathan froze and stared at her, shocked to his very core. The last thing he could have expected on this night of miracles was to learn that he had a child. Was it possible? It must be; he vividly recalled his last visit home to his wife. Audrey smiled at his gobsmacked expression. </p>
<p>“Would you like to see her?”</p>
<p>He nodded mutely; it was the only thing he could do. Audrey took his hand and led him out of the bathroom and down the hallway to a door that had been painted light blue. She opened it softly and led him inside. The light from the hallway illuminated a tiny figure tucked into a warm bed, sleeping soundly with a doll tucked under one arm. </p>
<p>“There,” Audrey said. “I left her here, with Pim and Marcy from next door watching her as she slept. They’ve got grandkids, so they’re good with children. They left when we got here; I don’t think you saw them. ”</p>
<p>She fell silent as Nathan stepped forward and reached out to touch the sleeping child. He hesitated before touching her face, then let his fingers glide over her cheek. </p>
<p>“Oh, Audrey,” was all he could say. “Oh, Audrey.”</p>
<p>How hard it must have been for her, alone and pregnant after his arrest, after not having seen him for months. She must have been so frightened without him to care for her. </p>
<p>Back in the hallway, Audrey wrapped her arms around her husband’s waist. “She is your greatest gift to me. She was all I had left of you once they took you.” She kissed his cheek gently, lingering close to his face. </p>
<p>Nathan closed his eyes, feeling his blood heat for the first time in years. It warmed him through, and he wrapped his arms around his wife, heart pounding, never wanting to let her go. Her lips touched his in a soft caress, and he smiled against them, pulling back slightly.</p>
<p>“Let’s go to bed,” he whispered, and the laugh that he loved rang out as she took his hand and led him to their bedroom. </p>
<p>Nathan fell asleep that night wrapped in his wife’s arms, the blankets of their tousled bed wrapped firmly around them both. It was the first real sleep he had had in half a decade, and he slept blissfully, his head pillowed in his wife’s chest. It had not been a dream, being released. Nothing would ever make him believe it had been. And in the morning when he woke, a strange sense of peace filled him, pushing the last of the guilt away. It had not been his fault, the accident, and he could live now, as he always should have with his wife and their daughter. More would follow, if Audrey had her way, and he did not want to say her nay. Smiling with sheer contentment, Nathan curled up around Audrey, wrapped the quilts tighter around them both, and fell asleep once more.</p>
