<center><b>“10th Street Bar”</b><br>
Emily Gravlin</center><br><br>

<p>Fiftyish woman,<br>
Dyed red hair with gray roots—<br>
Black-ringed eyes and blue cigarette smoke<br>
Booth eight behind the pool table<br>
Rubbing the green plastic polyester next to her<br>
Empty ring finger with a thin tan line.</p>

<p>Old Bill at the bar<br>
Always here<br>
Counts grimy change from a pocket<br>
On a stiff old Salvation Army flannel shirt—<br>
Steals shots when the owner goes in the back.</p>

<p>Waitress with a sticky plastic tray<br>
Caked red lipstick<br>
Sings at 10:30 from a makeshift stage.<br>
Barbra Streisand with a honeyed drawl.</p>

<p>Six-year old boy in front of the jukebox<br>
Watches mommy fall off her barstool<br>
Laughing.<br>
His stomach grumbles<br>
As he sips a Shirley Temple.</p>

<p>Owner and barkeep—<br>
Cherry cheeks puff out steamy breaths<br>
Onto spotty tumblers<br>
He rubs with the old red rag<br>
He keeps next to the till.</p>
