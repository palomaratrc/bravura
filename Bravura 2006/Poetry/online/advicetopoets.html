<center><b>“Advice to Poets”</b><br>
Adam Marley</center><br><br>

<p>If you want to be a poet<br>
it is really quite<br>
simple.<br>
First, you must take out your eyes<br>
and screw them in backwards.<br>
Watch the creative impulses<br>
as they bounce around in your brain,<br>
vivacious chemicals screaming.<br>
Second, you must shove your head <br>
between two fluffy pillows<br>
until all outside sound is drowned out<br>
and all you hear is your heartbeat,<br>
for that is the rhythm you will use.<br>
Third, you must peel off your flesh <br>
and run about through a field of grass<br>
so that you may<br>
feel the blades as they grasp<br>
at your sticky insides.<br>
Fourth, you must swallow your tongue<br>
and have it dance<br>
through the deep pits<br>
of your body.<br>
Have it taste your blood,<br>
your bile,<br>
your soul.<br>
If through all this<br>
you finally find <br>
your creative center<br>
and if there you see<br>
a little cantankerous gnome <br>
in green spandex tights<br>
with a big fluffy hat<br>
with a little star on the end,<br>
crouched over a desk<br>
with pencil in hand,<br>
grumbling to himself about<br>
how much he hates his job,<br>
ask him carefully<br>
what the differences are between<br>
a fluffy duck-shaped cloud<br>
swimming lazily in the sky<br>
and a duck lazily swimming in a lake<br>
with its head in the clouds.</p>

<p>Or, if the above directions seem like<br>
too much work,<br>
just sit in a park and pick some dandelions.</p>
