<center><b>A Smooth, Gray Rock</b><br>
By Linda Roux</center><br><br>

<p>“Read me New Hampshire’s record catches.”</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Landlocked salmon,” she reads. “Thirty-six inches.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighteen pounds, eight ounces, 1914.”</p>

<p>“Go on.” What a sight that must have been.<br>
A bit bigger than my catch in ‘49.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Lake trout, thirty-nine and one half inches.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-eight pounds and eight ounces, caught by<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Albert C. Staples of Massachusetts<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on April 24, 1958.”</p>

<p>In a stream as clean as a Quaker prayer<br>
salmon swim against the ice-cold current<br>
as if trying to hook their downcurved snouts<br>
on backward-running, rushing water.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Black crappie, seventeen and one quarter inches.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom Noyes of New Hampshire, February 2000.”</p>

<p>My daughter is 40 but doesn’t know how to cry.<br>
She’s impacted like these bowels of mine.<br>
My kidneys, my heart, all are shutting down.<br>
So I watch the coho or trout or sockeye<br>
swimming across this tiresome ceiling.<br>
“Thank you, sweetheart. I’ll rest now.”</p>

<p>Waking, I wonder where she’s gone.<br>
Now I’m no longer a member of<br>
the tribe who walk when and where they want.<br>
I hear doors open and close several times.<br>
After a while she walks into my room<br>
and places something from Alaska in my hand.<br>
She must have found it among the seashells<br>
on the kitchen windowsill,<br>
a water-smoothed rock, but grainy, and shaped<br>
as if made to fit in my rough, cupped hand.<br>
She had put it outside to warm in the day<br>
then she brought it in, the last sunlight,<br>
so I could feel it on my hands again.</p>
