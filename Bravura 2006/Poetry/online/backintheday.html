<center><b>“Back in the Day”</b><br>
Brian Payne</center><br><br>

<p>We liked to feed the ants.<br>
When we were kids we<br>
Would clean the pool and feed<br>
The crispy corpses of drowned insects<br>
To our hungry colony of ants near the shed.<br>
One week they didn’t come out<br>
Of their tiny hole to devour the limp spider.</p>

<p>Daddy said they were pests.<br>
Sissy said they were pets.<br>
We never brought it up again.<br>
Now we throw the centipedes and<br>
Scorpions to the dust in the alley<br>
When we find them in the filters.</p>
