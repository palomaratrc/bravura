<center><b>Broken Hearts and Rusty Nails</b><br>
By Donna Booher</center><br><br>

<p>If you step on a rusty nail,<br>
Scream.  It’s okay to let everyone know it happened.<br>
Try limping.  If that doesn’t work.  That’s okay too.<br>
Let someone lend you a shoulder.<br>
Clean the wound.  It’ll sting some.<br>
But that’s to be expected.  <br>
Let it mend and then,<br>
Watch out for rusty nails,<br>
Only to hit your head, instead.<br>
‘Cus, you see, accidents will happen.<br>
No matter how careful you aim to be.<br>
And it’s hard to play like it doesn’t hurt much.<br>
When it does.  So let it.  <br>
Don’t pretend it ain’t nothin.<br>
Because, you know, it’ll never heal right.<br>
If you don’t let it sting proper</p>
