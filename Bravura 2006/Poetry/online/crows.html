<center><b>Crows</b><br>
By Clayton Beach</center><br><br>

<p>The crows are becoming a nuisance they say,<br>
10,000 and growing in greater San Diego.<br>
Crowding the morning mists with a “Cah! Cah! Cah!”<br>
they flood the grenadine skies<br>
in droves at dawn and dusk,<br>
commuting to and from the local hotspots,<br>
feasting on the trash that we leave behind.  <br>
One day, I nearly ran down a crow<br>
as he hovered above a gory mess of red and yellow<br>
already flattened to the asphalt.<br>
At the last possible second <br>
he abandoned his prize, greedily stealing<br>
one last slice of pepperoni pizza, and then<br>
he flew away, high above the midday traffic<br>
with that slice of pie hanging from his beak.<br>
Why blame the crows for adapting so well?<br>
Why hate them for thriving on our chaos?  <br>
The gnatcatcher, his time is up, I fear, <br>
for he cannot live amid concrete seas <br>
and forests of false-pine cellular towers,<br>
so learn to praise the crow and his brethren,<br>
coyote and pigeon, for they have learned <br>
to feed from garbage cans and highways,<br>
don’t blame the symptoms of your own virulence.</p>
