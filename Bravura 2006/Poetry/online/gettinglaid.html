<center><b>Getting Laid - On My Terms</b><br>
By Sherrie Gonzales-Kolb</center><br><br>
 
<p>You were an ubiquitously competent lover<br>
all encompassing, <br>
well, almost -<br>
mind and body -<br>
the Soul? <br>
I'll reserve judgment for<br>
that hypothetical day which remains to be seen<br>
but -<br>
never underestimate<br>
pure, carnal pleasure unto<br>
frenzied release<br>
as a starting place<br>
where all masks and bets are temporarily off<br>
and I invite you to be under my skin<br>
somewhere in between raunch and routine, <br>
tidbits of CNN, World Updates and Rogaine commercials<br>
in this tawdry hotel<br>
that reeks of cigarettes, <br>
cheap one nighters, and<br>
desperate moments -<br>
no Gideons' in sight -<br>
where we will not wake up<br>
in each others' arms -<br>
leaving before check out<br>
as brazenly as we came<br>
back to our discreet and orderly lives. </p>
