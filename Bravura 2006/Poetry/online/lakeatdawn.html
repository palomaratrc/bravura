<center><b>The Lake at Dawn</b><br>
By Clayton Beach</center><br><br>

<p>The fog hung high<br>
over the lake and<br>
meandered to the glassy surface<br>
in long, lazy fingers.<br>
She imagined<br>
that her father had taken her<br>
on an expedition <br>
into unknown territories<br>
rather than just<br>
some boring fishing trip.</p>

<p>The only sounds <br>
were her father’s steady breath,<br>
the ripple of water <br>
purling at the kayak’s bow<br>
and the slight splash<br>
of his blade cutting water.<br>
She had never before<br>
witnessed such natural silence <br>
and it enveloped her peacefully<br>
along with the chill, moist air.  </p>

<p>All of a sudden, <br>
a patch of land loomed <br>
out of the fog <br>
like some prehistoric beast.  <br>
It was furry and green <br>
with moss and bushes and <br>
it stuck its long neck <br>
far out into the silvery water.<br>
A shadow flew above them, <br>
and the wisps of mist <br>
transformed it<br>
into a giant, flying reptile.  </p>

<p>Her father remained silent<br>
as he rowed, and she <br>
took in the scene<br>
with deep, thirsty breaths, <br>
drinking the feeling<br>
of  cool, misty air,<br>
chromed, rippling water, <br>
and white, wispy fog.  </p>
