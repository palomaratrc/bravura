<center><b>On Turning 60</b><br>
By Karen Wooton</center><br><br>

<p>Wow—What a surprise.<br>
At 25 I knew I only had 10 years left, I knew I wouldn’t<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make it past 35.<br>
By 35 I had a child and knew I had to stick around<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A while longer.<br>
By 50 I was beginning to hit my stride and my child was <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly up and gone…and I was catching on.<br>
At 60 feels like I’ve arrived.  All those things in life requiring dues<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They’ve been paid.<br>
I’ve got the hang of this life business now.  <br>
It took me every one of those years to figure some of this stuff out 	<br>	
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here is what I know today.</p>

<p>The prime directive of life is just have fun<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boredom is a choice—<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are way too many wonderous things to engage me <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is nowhere near enough time in a day to fit it all in.</p>

<p>The only things in life I can control:<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How I think and<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How I feel<br>
The rest is out of my hands <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And most of it is none of my business.</p>

<p>The universe spills abundance into my hands everyday<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I have to do is keep my hands cupped.</p>

<p>I have no control over the first thought that enters my head<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some of the are duzzies.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have total control over the second thought.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can change my mind at any time—I only have to want to.</p>

<p>All of life’s challenges offer a seed of opportunity.<br> 
Walking through a challenge with grace is finding the seed<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saying ‘Thank You.’</p>

<p>Many individuals are highly evolved souls.  Mankind is primitive.</p>

<p>My best ideas always require a second opinion.  <br>
I can dazzle myself with my own brilliance<br>
To the exclusion of common sense.</p>

<p>As for how much older I get to become…<br>
I only have this moment, maybe this day.<br>
I’m going to live it knowing that if it is my last<br>
It was terrific.</p>
