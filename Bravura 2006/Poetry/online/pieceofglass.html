<center><b>Piece of Glass</b><br>
by Sarah O’Nan</center><br><br>

<p>Your facade as a wall has been broken. <br>
The mortar was play-doh and the bricks were all plastic. <br>
And as it turns out, you're glass. <br>
A simple shard of crystal. <br>
Grasping at the covers and excuses <br>
You stutter your way out of my sight <br>
Step by step you back away <br>
For fear you might get shattered. <br>
I won't break you- <br>
I can't break you! <br>
You're too pretty. <br>
Too fragile. <br>
And if you're angled <br>
In just the right way <br>
I can see my own reflection.</p>
