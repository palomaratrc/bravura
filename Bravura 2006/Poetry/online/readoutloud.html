<center><b>read out loud, loudly</b><br>
By Nicole Lee</center><br><br>

<p>I am sad to see the sad darkness round those<br>
eyes of yours and truly, truly, I am goddamn tired<br>
of hearing different stories that are all the same<br>
all the same because they all end with you <br>
in tears<br>
cause tears are the only symbol you know for <br>
the tragedy rending you in secret places</p>

<p>I am angry, too, that there is tragedy but I<br>
am hesitant to settle in a world where such <br>
a thing is a fixture and that will not be my <br>
coping mechanism--resignation is only <br>
hesitation to experience more--<br>
and so you, friend,<br>
I invite you to this unpainted room<br>
of non-descript color in which you are<br>
welcome to swirl the sad the bad the <br>
hints of happy the shouts of hope the<br>
unspeakably awful with the bright light<br>
of glad because truly,<br>
they mix but don’t blend <br>
life doesn’t end up grey nor<br>
should it ever fall from your eyes<br>
in drops that you use to show that life<br>
is dropping away<br>
express yourself however you want<br>
but do not stop, satisfied, when you are<br>
empty because that’s the time the lies<br>
will get you, the time when you most<br>
need the next thing cause there is <br>
always the next thing<br>
so I invite you to share my joy<br>
in a potluck of emotion<br>
and we don’t even need pots so <br>
I guess we could call it the <br>
luck of emotion, <br>
the inexplicable contradiction of <br>
joy and the many things sharper than<br>
cut diamonds, <br>
that cast more rainbows </p>

<p>if we bleed <br>
if we cry<br>
if we halt before every kiss<br>
it does not end things and it does<br>
not do a disservice <br>
to the joy that I couldn’t <br>
get to stay in the serving dish <br>
but is really the<br>
air around enabling us<br>
to dance while we experience<br>
everything else</p>

<p>bring whatever you have to <br>
offer and everything else, too,<br>
but in this blank blank <br>
room<br>
remember to breathe and <br>
resign yourself to the fact that</p>

<p>the air is magic.</p>
