<center><b>SPF 45</b><br>
By Sherrie Gonzales-Kolb</center><br><br>

<p>I soak up the sun<br>
slathered in SPF 45<br>
and in my pink visor<br>
content to be without you on this<br>
'made for lovers only' day<br>
I am affirmed by how well<br>
you know me, and yet, how you<br>
are still surprised at the hybrid fruit<br>
produced by my mercurial moods<br>
delighted and humbled by my gifts<br>
of fire, wood, and words<br>
wrapped in string<br>
and when I get home tonight<br>
there will be a card from Mama<br>
like the one I've received every year<br>
of my life<br>
something lacey and girlie and<br>
astonishingly unlike me<br>
and it will tug at my heartstrings<br>
like they have for the past 44 years<br>
until I toss it in the trash<br>
with a love that could envelop<br>
the entire world<br>
my son will bring me lunch<br>
and some little chocolate candies<br>
shaped like seashells<br>
which he knows I will not eat, and<br>
which he knows I will give to someone<br>
who will be sad today<br>
on this day<br>
made for lovers<br>
I silently and solitarily absorb the warmth<br>
of this most unselfish and reliable sun<br>
through all the layers of the protection<br>
that I may always<br>
find necessary<br>
knowing that despite all of the glaring imperfections<br>
in this life<br>
I am loved. </p>
