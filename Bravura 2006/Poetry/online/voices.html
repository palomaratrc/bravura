<center><b>Voices</b><br>
By Michael Parker</center><br><br>

<p>The war torn faces<br>
Distended and screaming<br>
Pleading<br>
Not here; Not now; but Everywhere;<br>
Hands trembling; blood soaked fear<br>
It’s all for nothing, and nothing for all;<br>
Innocence lost, consumed by sand<br>
No one knows, No one cares<br>
What we’ve lost in blank stares</p>

<p>A last breath taken, all is lost in that split second<br>
Should I shoot or should I hide<br>
Mom will be so proud today<br>
 I gave my life for the USA…</p>

<p>Oh, he was so handsome then<br>
What a waste<br>
 To say goodbye so soon<br>
 My son<br>
 I shall weep, and forever keep<br>
This token flag upon my chair<br>
A tribute to you, for what you’ve done</p>

<p>Podium ready, here I stand<br>
To tell the land our important plan<br>
We shall fight, and we shall win<br>
At a cost I know, It’s not cheap<br>
To keep my house so bleached and clean<br>
Sons and Daughters they will fall<br>
But it’s for the good of us all.  </p>
