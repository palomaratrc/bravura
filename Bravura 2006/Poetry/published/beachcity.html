<center><b>Beach City Living</b><br>
By Carmela Zermeno<br><br></center>

<p>Beach city life seemed a luxury to me, our chicken coop apartments had a view.<br>
Well if you ran across the grass to the neighbors, <br>
climbed up the stairs and stood on boxes,<br>
and looked over the sand colored wall blocking the train tracks,<br>
you could see the ocean.</p>

<p>When the builders passed around the flyer to the neighbors, that’s what  it said,<br>
“Beautiful beachside living with a view” in bright blue letters. <br>
Boy, the apartments drawn on there were beautiful.</p>

<p>They were painted in all kinds of bright colors,<br>
and I bet you they thought of that because all the movies point out that Mexicans love bright colors,<br>
and most of the time I’d say that’s right.</p>

<p>We’re a bunch of show offs.</p>

<p>All of us got caught up in it, they had something for everyone:<br>
for the kids they would build a state of the art playground,<br>
and really that was for the adults who wanted to get rid of their kids:<br>
while they fried the papitas for breakfast,<br>
and later when they fried the papitas and nopales for lunch, <br>
and then just before it got dark when they refried those things again,<br>
and also fried beans.</p>

<p>Certain times of the year I think the parents forgot they had kids,</p>
 
<p>Like in the summer when the kids ran wild up and down the bleach white sidewalks,<br>
with no food time,<br>
or rest time,<br>
or come inside for no reason time, <br>
when no playgrounds were needed to have fun,<br>
thinking up ways to get things wet and dirty all day long.</p>

<p>For the adults, and those who did not like to stink, the builders offered: <br>
a square of a building with two washers and two dryers, <br>
which seemed great at the time,<br>
but not so great when you have to share, <br>
and a huge parking lot:<br>
no more parking on the street and hoping the Cholo’s,<br>
want to be bad asses in English, <br>
don’t steal your things, <br>
but the greatest thing of all, for adults and children:</p>

<p>The bowling alley they promised across the street.<br>
So when they said our church could stay, <br>
everyone signed on the dotted line and for six months while they built the chicken coops, we lived in style.<br>
A, so many foot, camper we nicknamed “La Poderosa”, the strong one.<br>
Man was she beautiful,<br>
long and lean with purple sparkling tape shooting up from the bottom along the side to the front.</p>

<p>We watched our house get torn down and I cried because I’d miss our tree,<br>
the weeping willow in the back with all those drooping leaves,<br>
it was then I think I felt my heart sinking, like when you do something wrong and you know you’re going to get it,<br>
like a dog that travels on its belly to you because it tore up the trash again, <br>
a black shadow passed over our heads, <br>
over the church, <br>
and rested on the weeping willow, <br>
perhaps trying to shade it from the on coming blows.</p>
