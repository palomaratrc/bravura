<center><b>The Civil War</b><br>
By Katherine Franklin</center><br><br>

<p>Every family has its secret<br>
nobody talks about the secret but<br>
somehow everyone knows.  </p>

<p>In my family their was my Uncle Si<br>
not my uncle actually, but my dad’s<br>
I think that makes him my great uncle<br>
He was not great to me nor to my cousin Sharon.</p>

<p>I think my dad enjoyed his visits.<br>
Uncle Si had known men who fought in the Civil War;<br>
My dad was fascinated with the Civil War.<br>
It was a fascinating war,<br>
brother against brother.<br>
Uncle Si could talk about the battles and <br>
He could talk about the wounds,<br>
the ones with blood<br>
and the ones without.<br>
 He would visit from time to time and share these stories</p>

<p>I never knew if he was invited or invited himself.<br>
He would get my bed and I would sleep on the couch.<br>
If you knew the secret,<br>
 why would you do that?</p>

<p>He brought gifts. <br>
Tokens for my mom and brother<br>
Something special for me<br>
There was this jewelry box…<br>
I was 40 when I destroyed that box,<br>
Oddly, some time after it had all come back.</p>

<p>Always deep in the night the gentle shaking,<br>
My name whispered,<br>
The first time I responded easily<br>
After that I tried to pretend not to wake until <br>
I had to give in.<br>
He would coax me to the dining room<br>
Away from my sleeping parent’s door.<br>
The hands, old hands, rubbing and proding, probing<br>
I don’t remember what he said but his voice<br>
Was soft and scratchy and I wanted it to be over.<br>
His breath smelled of whiskey and cigarettes<br>
And the awful way he used his tongue…<br>
You must not tell he would warn me.  <br>
You’re mommy will know you’ve been bad.<br>
Mustn’t tell.</p>

<p>Everyone in the family knew  <br>
Uncle Si had this problem<br>
With little girls. <br>
But no one ever told the little girls.  <br>
It was the family secret and you didn’t talk<br>
about those things.<br>
And I didn’t.<br>
My dad never knew I was a casualty of the Civil War.</p>
