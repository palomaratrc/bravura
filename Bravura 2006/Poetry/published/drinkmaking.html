<center><b>Drink Making at Starbucks</b><br>
Emily Gravlin</center><br><br>

<p>Buzzing around<br>
In their matching black-striped uniforms<br>
(Even when they wear color, it melts into the background<br>
and leaves them monochromatic)<br>
The cluster around the bar<br>
A hive of bees<br>
Wings twitching<br>
Abdomens humming with communication<br>
Talking into cell phones.<br>
They squeeze their cardboard cups<br>
Branding their palms with the tattoo of<br>
Modern corporate America.<br>
A female WASP with Botox-tight eyes<br>
Orders a tall, nonfat, suger-free vanilla latte.<br>
A heavy, mustached Latino man in boots<br>
And the tanned Abercrombie girl behind him<br>
Each order venti, extra-caramel, caramel frappuccinos<br>
And everyone pays with a five.<br>
The rest goes in the tip jar<br>
Which I get at the end of the week<br>
To support my mocha habit.</p>
