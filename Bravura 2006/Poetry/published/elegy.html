<center><b>Elegy for My Left Breast</b><br>
By Jenne A. Mendenhall</center><br><br>

<p>Farewell mend, companion flesh,<br>
chesty childish, short lived girlish bloom<br>
Too soon swaggering to woman's profile D<br>
Nippled and primed for mezzo passions<br>
in art and life.</p>

<p>Beneath your diva's prow, breath lifted<br>
heart and ribs, happy singing<br>
Handel arias, Mozart Brahm's songs<br>
and Negro spirituals.</p>

<p>Flesh remembers pleasure, tired heads<br>
bidden and unbidden, resting 'gainst<br>
Roving infant hands, fervent mouths<br>
loves fierce dark sweetness.</p>

<p>Gone now, old hurts and losses<br>
disappointments long forgotten<br>
But logged still in your mutinous ducts<br>
as cancers on the move.</p>

<p>Farewell dear part of me<br>
not two thoughts honored in our life<br>
But cherished these last days<br>
before the surgeon makes clean breast of thee.</p>
