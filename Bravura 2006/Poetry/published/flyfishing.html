<center><b>Fly Fishing from a Ferris Wheel</b><br>
By Nicole Lee</center><br><br>

<p>The only girl on the ferris wheel<br>
holds a can of unopened chicken.<br>
She will get hungry later.<br>
Her pa stuck a can opener in his<br>
back pocket cause then she'll need<br>
him, cause then she'll seek him.</p>

<p>A woman works the levers and sweats<br>
a shiny lot in the unkind heat,<br>
dark spots on her dirty overalls.<br>
Dry brown grass, stiff in its death,<br>
irritates her bare feet.  She scratches<br>
them on the backs of her calves, one<br>
at a time, a slow-motion hop, something<br>
of a dance, as the wheel throws each car<br>
forward and pulls it back again,<br>
unapologetically.  She lets it spin too<br>
many times too too<br>
many times too<br>
many times.</p>

<p>The girl's eyes close and she<br>
imagines herself bait, a hook<br>
through her middle, some large<br>
fisherman throwing her far out-<br>
first far forward,<br>
and then down to the waterline-<br>
the natural arc of a fishline casting.</p>

<p>Her pa has weight<br>
like water-you can't breathe<br>
when you can't break surface.</p>

<p>Her pa has weight like<br>
suffocation that fills her<br>
lungs while she helplessly sees that<br>
no matter how much air surrounds<br>
her it's what's in her, what's filled her,<br>
that means she<br>
can't breathe.</p>

<p>can't the girl can't and can't<br>
and the girl can't do the can't anymore<br>
there are no more tears to fall<br>
like sweatdrops.</p>

<p>the ferris wheel casts her out<br>
and then pulls her back too<br>
many times too too<br>
many times too<br>
many times<br>
pulls her back<br>
flicking the surface</p>

<p>her pa sits at a nearby picnic table<br>
he watches her get closer<br>
and then pull away he watches<br>
her get closer<br>
and   then<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pull<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wants to<br>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clutch her<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;back to him<br>
young girl fly</p>

<p>she knows for whom<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she is bait:<br>
both the water and<br>
the monster in it</p>

<p>a woman works the levers and<br>
she notices for the first time<br>
the skinny girl on the ferris wheel<br>
the grass still irritates her<br>
but she stops hopping<br>
lifts her hand to her eyes and<br>
follows the transparent fishline from<br>
the girl's torn gut to the<br>
man waiting at the table<br>
for his next meal.</p>

<p>A woman works the levers and<br>
she works the ferris wheel<br>
pulling the girl back too<br>
too many times<br>
not enough not not<br>
enough not<br>
enough.</p>
