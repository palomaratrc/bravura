<center><b>Hands</b><br>
By Ernest Lucero</center><br><br>

<p>I can remember<br>
Years ago, as a teen<br>
Looking at someone’s hands.<br>
I do not remember who he was.<br>
I remember only his hands.</p>

<p>I remember thinking how they looked—<br>
Tired, scarred, dark from the sun, <br>
Wrinkled from years of labor.</p>

<p>I looked at mine, smooth and clean, and<br>
Remember thinking, How did his hands <br>
Get like that?</p>

<p>Now, many years later,<br>
I look at mine,<br>
And I know.</p>
