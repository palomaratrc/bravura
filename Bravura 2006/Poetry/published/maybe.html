<center><b>“Maybe”</b><br>
by Ashleigh Blake</center><br><br>

<p>Maybe it’s her eyes that sparkle different colors<br>
In different lights.<br>
Maybe it’s the roses in her hand<br>
That deliver her emotions<br>
In endless opportunities<br>
For love.<br>
Maybe it’s the way she smiles<br>
At the memories<br>
She frames around her room.<br>
Maybe it’s the Louis Vuitton accessories<br>
She drowns her loneliness in.<br>
Maybe it’s her arms that wrap around<br>
Anything that reaches out to hold her.<br>
It could be her name,<br>
Or her face…<br>
But it’s what we don’t know<br>
About her<br>
That we pretend we do.</p>
