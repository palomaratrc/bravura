<center><b>“Men in White Suits:  A Villanelle”</b><br>
A.J. Ray</center><br><br>

<p>Men in white suits want to take me away<br>
Inside a van that comes out from their zoo<br>
Due to the fact that I’m crazy, they say.</p>

<p>They must already be well on their way.<br>
Panic and mayhem!  Oh what can I do?<br>
Men in white suits want to take me away.</p>

<p>How can I stand against those such as they?<br>
Looks like I’ll have to bid freedom adieu<br>
Due to the fact that I’m crazy, they say.</p>

<p>Would have been able to keep them at bay<br>
If I had mastered the art of kung fu.<br>
Men in white suits want to take me away.</p>

<p>Once they arrive I’ll be forced to obey.<br>
If I escaped they would surely pursue<br>
Due to the fact that I’m crazy, they say.</p>

<p>Knowing my fate makes me feel much dismay.<br>
Please let them give me a room with a view!<br>
Men in white suits want to take me away<br>
Due to the fact that I’m crazy, they say.</p>
