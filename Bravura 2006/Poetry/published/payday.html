<p>The phone rings on payday<br>
Nonstop.  From his crimson couch<br>
We sat and watched videos of John Fahey<br>
Flicking cigarette ash into his guitar</p>

<p>My friend has a large collection of videos<br>
And rarely leaves his apartment these days.<br>
So to be sure, he takes his Vitamin C.<br>
I jockey the VCR while he weighs out the bags.</p>

<p>Today we watched Orson Welles grow fat,<br>
And through the friendly smoke of sampled goods<br>
We watched the Monks on German television.<br>
I watched his back, too.</p>

<p>As he slouched over the scale,<br>
His elegant spine peeking through his thin t-shirt.<br>
I knew our thing was only temporary,<br>
Yet I still tried to love him then.</p>

<p>Wearing Sandy Bull’s haircut<br>
And a cold that won’t heal, he brushed his knee against mine<br>
As if to say, thank you.  What a high.<br>
He held it there for the full duration</p>

<p>Of each moment in between<br>
Come-on-by and drop-on-in.<br>
Later that night he said my skin felt more dangerous<br>
Than all his business on payday.</p>
