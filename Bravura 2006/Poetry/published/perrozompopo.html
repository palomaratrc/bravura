<center><b>Perro Zompopo</b><br>
By Denise Brown</center><br><br>

<p>At 2:14 in the insomniac night<br>
of Puerto Escondido,<br>
explosion rocks the world outside<br>
these walls, and sets me on my feet<br>
running to the door, out to the porch<br>
and scanning the horizon ‘til<br>
my vision snags on bolt of lightning<br>
in the eastern sky.<br>
And CRACK! It fells me like a timber to<br>
the hammock slung across the porch,  <br>
where, snagged again, I<br>
see shooting stars above -<br>
Perseid sparks like fireworks<br>
in the steamy August night,<br>
and rhythmic roar of tumbling Pacific <br>
fills the black space in between <br>
the meteors and lightning bolts.</p>

<p>A gecko chirps. <br>
I know his Spanish name.<br>
It’s etched across my brain electric blue, <br>
and musty red Oaxacan dust <br>
rises from the earth like dawn.</p>

<p>Alive in every pore,<br>
I sleep.</p>
