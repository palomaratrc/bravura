<center><b>Ten a.m. Sunday</b><br>
By Linda Roux</center><br><br>

<p>As you slake your eyes on her in bed<br>
she reminds you of an anaconda<br>
curled among the amethyst petals<br>
of a jacaranda tree. One muscle<br>
of hers wakes the next until<br>
you see she’s long as a schoolbus, but <br>
much quieter. Don’t mind the panther<br>
with malachite eyes, whose spots are<br>
(then aren’t) the shadows of leaves; <br>
or the sapphire-throated hummingbird<br>
dipping into that moss-cool pond;<br>
the long one will wrap herself around you,<br>
tighten after each breath escapes, <br>
help you to your own little death.</p>
