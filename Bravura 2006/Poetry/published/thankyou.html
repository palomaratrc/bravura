<center><b>“Thank You for Flying Abstraction Airlines”</b><br>
<i>Third Place Winner, Poetry</i><br>
by Elizabeth Webbe</center><br><br>

<p><u>Ambition</u><br>
Curled hair and lipstick<br>
(“I’m Really Not a Waitress Red”),<br>
new pumps,<br>
navy blue<br>
to match her uniform.<br>
Bronze wings for a 19 year old girl<br>
flying at 35,000 feet.<br>
Someday they’ll be made of gold.</p>

<p><u>Injustice</u><br>
Paying $1500 for a <br>
first class upgrade<br>
to sit next to the man<br>
who needs a seat belt extender.</p>

<p><u>Poverty</u><br>
Skyharbor in Phoenix,<br>
two stops left till home and<br>
three days to payday.<br>
Route 66 is the designated smoking area.<br>
Eight dollars for a Bloody Mary.<br>
Just enough for a double.</p>

<p><u>Loneliness</u><br>
Feet hang out of the window<br>
of a hotel room by the airport.<br>
Another RJ900 comes in for a landing.<br>
Rolled up nylons<br>
A freshly pressed uniform<br>
Pedicured toes<br>
And an empty bottle of cabernet.<br>
Smoking my last cigarette,<br>
I play “Godspeed” one more time.<br>
I’ll be home soon.</p>

<p><u>Contentment</u><br>
A window seat on a Dash-8,<br>
redeye half empty,<br>
an extra pillow,<br>
fresh out of the plastic,<br>
lights out at 15,000 feet.<br>
Dreaming.</p>
