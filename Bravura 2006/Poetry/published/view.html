Wesley Heid</center><br><br>

<p>We were driving down a pockmarked street<br>
through some broken part of town.<br>
Looked like it had been through a war—<br>
houses without windows,<br>
boards covering their empty eyes.<br>
Building walls<br>
had lost most of their plaster,<br>
the brick underneath exposed,<br>
naked and dirty.<br>
I saw a girl out of the corner of my eye,<br>
sitting by the street,<br>
her pink dress falling apart,<br>
no shoes on her feet.<br>
Dirty face,<br>
dark, dead eyes.<br>
I felt something in my chest—<br>
guilt or something that I’ll never explore—<br>
doesn’t matter, really.<br>
In the end,<br>
no one will notice when she’s gone.</p>
