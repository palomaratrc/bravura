<center><b>You Almost Had Me Fooled</b><br>
By Jodi Sanchez</center><br><br>

<p>While a couple<br>
tried to conduct me<br>
to a threesome<br>
in  an unfamiliar city<br>
I thought you stood me up.</p>

<p>You were forty five minutes late.<br>
Given our roller<br>
coaster relationship,<br>
you almost had me fooled,<br>
and these freaky strangers<br>
almost had me convinced.</p>

<p>Ready to cab it<br>
back to the airport,<br>
I suddenly saw you.<br>
A sweaty blonde,<br>
thin silver frames<br>
sliding down your<br>
crooked nose;<br>
white Hanes tee<br>
clinging to your<br>
Ivory soap skin.<br>
You were dashing<br>
through the crowds<br>
of the Boston train station<br>
and I knew<br>
I wouldn't have<br>
to dine<br>
alone.</p>
