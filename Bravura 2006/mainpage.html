The Bravura staff would like to extend thanks to the following people for their support of the creative community at Palomar in general and for their support of the literary journal in particular:  Robert Deegan, President of Palomar College; Berta Cuaron, Vice-President of Instruction at Palomar College; and Dr. Katheryn Garlow, Dean of Languages and Literature at Palomar College.  The staff would also like to profusely thank the President’s Associates for generously providing the funds for the writing and visual awards as well as for the full-color cover and insert; their very generous contribution heartily encourages the artistic achievements of our students, who in turn are fortunate to have such a supportive group associated with our college.  Finally, we would like to thank Jack Mawhinney, who works very hard to enrich the coffers of not just Bravura, but of the entire English Department.<br><br>
