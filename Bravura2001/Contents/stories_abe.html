  <p class="MsoDate"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">My
  mother is fifty-seven years old, and she is healthy and has a lot of energy.
  She wakes up early every morning and walks three miles every day. My parents
  have managed their own business. Even though my mother is busy with their
  business, she takes care of my grandfather, my father and my brother’s
  family. She is the center of my family, and everyone counts on her. When my
  grandmother had a stroke and could not move by herself at all, my mother took
  care of her all day for one month until she had gone. She said to me she was
  glad that she had taken care of my grandmother as much as she had, and she
  also said, “I was sad when I remembered your grandmother in her youth. She
  had a lot of dignity. When your aunt and I were children, she was very strict
  with us; however, she was also a thoughtful person. She taught me how to cook
  sushi and wear kimonos. After she had a stroke, I wished she could get well,
  but I knew she was too old to recover completely. Also, even though she
  recovered somewhat, she could never have been the mother I used to rely on a
  long time ago; however, now I needed to be her mother while I took care of
  her. It was very sad and complicated to see my parents getting older. You will
  understand it someday.” I could not comprehend that my parents would get old
  like my grandfather and my grandmother. Although it would happen to them in
  the future, I expected it would take more time.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoDate"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Since
  I moved to the U.S., my family has always been concerned about me because they
  do not know about my lifestyle here. Even if I call them every weekend or send
  pictures that I took here, these do not work enough to relieve their worry. My
  mother is especially concerned about me; therefore, I tried to convince her to
  visit me in the U.S. because I believed that she could relieve herself from
  her worry after she met my wonderful host family and friends here. Finally,
  she decided to come to the U.S. after the New Year. I had not seen her since I
  went back to Japan during the last summer break, so I was very excited to see
  her. It was her first time coming to the U.S, and she came alone even though
  she cannot speak English at all. I believed she would be fine because she is a
  strong and curious woman despite her age.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoDate"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">At
  the airport, we were so happy to see each other again and hugged each other
  tightly. When I hugged her, I felt her shoulders were small and skinny. I
  thought she had lost weight; however, she said, “I have gained weight.”<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoDate"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">“I
  felt you lost it.”<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoDate"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">“No.
  I have gained six pounds since last summer.”<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoDate"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">I
  thought I might have forgotten her figure a little because we had not seen
  each other for half a year. When I was a child, I often hugged her and felt
  her body was soft and strong. I guess I expected her body to be the same
  figure as in my childhood. However, this hug reminded me of my grandmother who
  had also become small and skinny when I hugged her in her later years. I was a
  little shocked about her change, but we were so excited to see each other
  again that I did not think about it much at the moment.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoDate"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">She
  had a big suitcase. When I saw it, I imagined she had brought many Japanese
  souvenirs for my friends and me because I had asked her if she could do so
  before. As soon as she arrived at my house, she opened her suitcase in my room
  to find some souvenirs for my host family. However, she did not come into our
  living room. When I went to my room to check on her, she was sitting beside
  her suitcase in confusion. She could not find her souvenirs and she said, “I
  put souvenirs for your host family together to find easily and give to them
  soon, but I cannot find them and cannot remember where they are.”<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoDate"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Finally
  she found them, but it took a while. I thought she forgot where she put them
  because she was probably too busy to pack her suitcase in a well-organized
  manner before she left Japan. The next morning she tried to find clothes and
  her jewels, but she could not find them. Watching her, I thought, “She might
  be still tired because of the long flight. I hope she will be fine
  tomorrow.”<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoDate"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Regardless
  of enough rest that night, she still forgot where she had put her stuff in her
  suitcase again. She said, “Recently I often forget where I put my stuff. I
  am ashamed of myself.”<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoDate"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">What
  she said reminded me of my grandmother again, who often forgot where she put
  her stuff. At those times I helped to find them together with her. I thought,
  “Is my mother getting old? Is she becoming like my grandmother? She was not
  like this last summer. I didn’t think she could get old so fast.” I did
  not want to think about it and said with irritation, “Mom, don’t spend
  your time looking for your stuff; don’t put your things in each small bag,
  but put them together, so you can find them easily.”<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoDate"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Actually,
  what I said to my mother was exactly the same as I had always said to my
  grandmother when she lost her stuff.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoDate"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Even
  though the stuff that she looked for was not necessary for her, she kept
  looking for a while. She was irritated with herself because she always forgot
  where she put her things and could not find them easily. Gradually, I felt
  sorry for her, so I helped her to find them as I did with my grandmother
  before.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoDate"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">While
  she stayed here, she needed enough time to be ready to go out every morning
  even if we needed to hurry. Not only did she spend time looking for her stuff
  but also she moved more slowly than before. I did not push her to hurry and
  tried to understand her; however, I was shocked by her slowness. In fact, it
  was painful for me to wait for her not because we needed to hurry but because
  I could not believe she could not act as fast as before. Even though her
  movements were not as slow as my grandmother’s, she had obviously gotten
  slower. To save time in the morning, I helped to set her hair. I had not paid
  attention to my mother’s hair well since she arrived here, but I was shocked
  when I saw a lot of gray hair. When I started to set her hair, she said, “I
  have a lot of gray hair, don’t I? I hate it.”<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoDate"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">“I
  don’t think you have a lot of gray hair. You have less gray hair than others
  your age.” <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoDate"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">What
  I said was true, but I could not tell her that her gray hair had been growing
  because she was proud of her black hair. While I was setting her hair, I
  imagined her black hair would be completely gray soon, and I felt sad with
  that.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoDate"><span style="font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Since
  my last visit to Japan, I felt she had grown older. Because I had not seen her
  in half a year, I could easily find her differences. Still, as my mother said,
  it is hard to think about our parents getting older because generally children
  want to keep their parents as reliable as they have always been. However, I
  need to be ready to accept the fact my parents will grow old as my grandfather
  and my grandmother did. The change of generation will come to our family soon,
  and she will pass the center of our family to me.<o:p>
  </o:p>

  had a great time together for eleven days. She likes America and my friends,
  so she wants to come back here again. On the last day of her trip, I took her
  to the airport. I hugged my mother again before she got on her airplane. I
  felt she was small and skinny, as I had felt before, but I was not as shocked
  as before. I believed I had now started to understand our changing.</font></span>
