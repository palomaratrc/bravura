  <p><b>by Ashley Cook</b></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>BEGINNING OF SCENE/VOICE OVER-<i>A man mid forties named FRANKY carries a
  crinkled paper bag, wearing dirty brown corduroys and walks from the bus
  station to the racetracks. This is practically an everyday event for him while
  the season runs strong. He has his life stowed away in one hand and anxiety in
  the other.</p>
  </i>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <b>
  <p>FRANKY: </b>Have you ever had an ordinary day? A day, where you go to
  school or work, and people are doing the same thing they did yesterday except
  they are wearing a different tie or skirt. Have you ever felt like you were
  walking in slow motion? Or, maybe, everyone around you is in slow motion, and
  you are at normal tempo. <i>(pause) </i>There are days when the air seems
  unbearable, the sun so condescending, and even the slightest wicked laughter
  scrapes your ears like fingernails to a chalkboard. But, you are the trooper
  you've always been and you breathe less deep today. You wear sunglasses, and
  the screeching laughter turns into music. More of the violin quality, if
  anything. So, did you say you've had an ordinary day?</p>
  <p>END OF SCENE <i>(calm)</p>
  </i>
  <p>Have you ever had one of those days where you thought everything would go
  perfect as planned? Of course you have. Have you ever been walking down the
  street not noticing anyone around you? Or do you notice them staring at you
  with their piercing eyes as if they could see right to your soul. They can see
  your face turn flush, they know you drink too much, and they sense you walking
  step by step down the asphalt sidewalk. They smell your stench. They know your
  fears. They drive the anxiety right to the shaking of your palm. They know you
  can't sleep at night because your thoughts run a race around the track of your
  brain. <i>(a little excited) </i>One minute you're a horse in full fleet of
  victory and the next you're being shot because you broke your leg. Breathe
  ...breathe...breathe. One more time, wait don't look, okay ...look! They just
  didn't have the patience to fix your leg ...I'm sorry. <i>(pause) </i>Maybe
  next time, you won't let them get to you. Maybe next time, you'll be more
  careful choosing who you let in. Or, maybe next time, you won't be so scared,
  and you'll realize not everyday goes perfect to plan. There are no more
  ordinary days, my friend.</p>
