  You Shall Know Well
  <p>by Kelli D</p>
  </font></b>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I fell upon a forest road, the position of which I cannot tell,</p>
  <p>But at its mouth it bore a sign &quot;Of this you shall know well&quot;.</p>
  <p>The path was dirt, aligned with willow and sage,</p>
  <p>And, at length, there was an oak; worn about with age.</p>
  <p>It smelled of life, and strength, and good.</p>
  <p>It felt of earth, of grass and of wood.</p>
  <p>Its leaves would quiver, caught in a breeze</p>
  <p>Then dance and skip, and bow to their knees.</p>
  <p>I observed the tree with quiet delight</p>
  <p>When, to my amazement, the tree took flight!</p>
  <p>It flew off to the north, where mountains lay asunder,</p>
  <p>And disappeared into nothing, with the clap of silent thunder.</p>
  <p>In its place, I saw a space, a space that wasn't there.</p>
  <p>It wasn't rock or dirt or grass, the space was simply air.</p>
  <p>Away from that space I meandered then,</p>
  <p>Walking on till who knows when.</p>
  <p>All of the sudden sounds did arise</p>
  <p>Sounds of horses to my surprise.</p>
  <p>The sound was sharp and loud and clear,</p>
  <p>But of the horses I only hear.</p>
  <p>I saw no sign of living thing,</p>
  <p>Yet on the noises continue to ring.</p>
  <p>Then, the bushes and shrub melt into earth, and forest turns to field,</p>
  <p>The sight of a rumbling heard its disappearance to yield.</p>
  <p>30 some odd horses in all.</p>
  <p>From stallions great to foals quite small.</p>
  <p>Manes of brown and silky hair,</p>
  <p>Tails that blossomed on the air.</p>
  <p>Eyes of ebony, ether, and coal,</p>
  <p>Among their presence I silently stole.</p>
  <p>With girth and speed they filled my eyes,</p>
  <p>Such beauty and grace, strength and size.</p>
  <p>Their hoofs did pound, their voices call,</p>
  <p>Their songs rang out from mountains tall.</p>
  <p>The mighty horses churned the ground,</p>
  <p>Then lifted right off, without making a sound.</p>
  <p>They flew off to the north, where mountains lay asunder,</p>
  <p>And disappeared into nothing, with the clap of silent thunder.</p>
  <p>In their place, I saw a space, a space that wasn't there.</p>
  <p>It wasn't rock or dirt or grass, the space was simply air.</p>
  <p>I was now left with considerable conclusion,</p>
  <p>This surely couldn't be just an illusion.</p>
  <p>The horses were real, as was the tree,</p>
  <p>Their flight, it seemed, just could not be.</p>
  <font FACE="Garamond">
  <p>But they were gone, and there stood the space,</p>
  <p>And me alone with a wondering face.</p>
  <p>So off again I went alone, in this story I tell,</p>
  <p>Wondering back to the sign before, &quot;Of this you shall know well&quot;.</p>
  <p>Next I fell upon a bay; the path flowed along its shore,</p>
  <p>I wandered down onto the beach; hoping answers were in store.</p>
  <p>I stood upon with sand about,</p>
  <p>And watched the sea breathe in and out.</p>
  <p>It heaved with heavy and thoughtful sighs,</p>
  <p>Blinking large and watchful eyes.</p>
  <p>From its depths I heard the song</p>
  <p>Of all the creatures long since gone.</p>
  <p>The creatures sprang forth into the sky</p>
  <p>As mother ocean heaved her final sigh.</p>
  <p>I watched the whale, long and round,</p>
  <p>Glide right past without a sound.</p>
  <p>As it passed, I met its eye,</p>
  <p>It shed a tear as I waved good bye.</p>
  <p>The great creatures of the sea flew past,</p>
  <p>Glancing back, that glance their last.</p>
  <p>They flew off to the north, where mountains lay asunder,</p>
  <p>And disappeared into nothing, with the clap of silent thunder.</p>
  <p>In their place, I saw a space, a space that wasn't there.</p>
  <p>It wasn't rock or dirt or grass, the space was simply air.</p>
  <p>All that was left was a great empty sea,</p>
  <p>No songs to sing, no pray to plea.</p>
  <p>The ocean said silently in my ear,</p>
  <p>&quot;I’m sorry, but there is nothing here&quot;</p>
  <p>Then she too turned away,</p>
  <p>And left with nothing more to say.</p>
  <p>She flew off to the north, where mountains lay asunder,</p>
  <p>And disappeared into nothing, with the clap of silent thunder.</p>
  <p>In her place, I saw a space, a space that wasn't there.</p>
  <p>It wasn't rock or dirt or grass, the space was simply air.</p>
  <p>It was at this point I did realize,</p>
  <p>The world was disappearing before my eyes!</p>
  <p>Each thing was gone, and in each place,</p>
  <p>There sat a cold and empty space.</p>
  <p>I remembered the sign, its message as well,</p>
  <p>It said, &quot;Of this you shall know well&quot;.</p>
  <p>Remember that earth is so fragile a place,</p>
  <p>So easily lost without a trace.</p>
  <p>Nature bares a gentle face,</p>
  <p>Often lost in progress' pace,</p>
  <p>Till all that's left is the human race,</p>
  <p>Surrounded by nothing but empty space.</p>
