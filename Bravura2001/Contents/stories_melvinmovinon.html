  <p>Henry sighed and tugged at the ring on his left hand. Holding his gloves
  awkwardly between thumb and forefinger he worked the gold band over his
  swollen knuckle, hands cold and clumsy from standing in the predawn chill.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well, Emma, it’s time.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I know, love.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Doesn’t seem right, doin’ this. Always thought I’d be buried
  wearin’ this ring.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;You know we discussed this, Henry. It’ll be best for you <i>and</i>
  for me. It’s time for both of us to move on.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Emma . . .&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;You have that exhibit in the City next week. Your portraits, that <i>Then
  and Now</i> series, will be a smash hit, just you wait and see.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Em . . .&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Have I ever been wrong about these things?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Emma, love, just because you’re dead doesn’t mean you’re always
  right.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I was <i>always</i> right, Henry, even when I was alive.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Hmm. You sure you know what you’re doin’—what <i>we’re</i>
  doin’—this time?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Henry James, you just take that ring and pitch it!&quot;</p>
  <p>Henry held the ring up to the just-visible arch of the sun and squinted at
  the gold glinting faintly between his fingers. Walking to the middle of the
  small curved bridge over the stream where it entered the partly frozen pond,
  he lifted his arm. With a free underhand swoop he slung the small metallic
  treasure—releasing it at the last possible moment—toward the sunbeams
  tearing his eyes.</p>
  <p>Without waiting to see where it fell, Henry James, husband to Emma for 32
  years and widower for 3, turned and walked through the snow toward the park
  entrance.</p>
  <p>Unseen, Emma moved out from the sunlight, ring caught tightly in her hand.
  Smiling lovingly at her husband’s back, she thought of Dorothy, the widow he’d
  meet next week at the uptown gallery displaying his photos. Dorothy would
  recognize a picture of her mother and herself as a young girl. The
  conversation she started with Henry would lead to dinner after the exhibition
  and to…</p>
  <p>Well, who knew exactly what it might lead to. Smiling roguishly, Emma
  tossed the ring up and caught it, whistling. Turning back toward the pond, she
  walked over the ice and still-open water into the sunrise.</p>
