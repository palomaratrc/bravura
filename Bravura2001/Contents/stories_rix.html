  When Walking Was a Chore</b>
  <p><b>Kristin Rix</b></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It was one of those hot summer days when walking was a chore, and only the
  most dignified of ladies could pull it off with only a glow. The days where
  the subtlest of hips could work their way through the burning asphalt, across
  marble games in the shade and over the out-slung legs of men while they drank
  beer and expounded on the women they would have done if . . . She could handle
  this heat. Those same men who tilted their hats to maximize on the shade and
  looked at her with disdainful eyes couldn't see how easily she maneuvered
  through the heat. They only saw the slightly disheveled hair, and the mildly
  rumpled flowered skirt that he saw clung so well to her thighs. It sailed over
  her beautiful thighs, it soared and danced a maraca when she skittered around
  the marble ring. He watched her first with respect, envy, even, and soon after
  with a desire to possess the hips that so easily swam amidst the heat that
  pulsed up in waves around her, barely grazing her.</p>
  <p>She walked his way. Perhaps it was the dress shop that sat just past the
  balustrade he eased himself against. Perhaps she walked her way into this dead
  Texas heat knowing he would be standing in her path, tilted her hat because
  she knew as she tilted it that he would only be able to see the suppleness of
  her lips as she approached and his eyes guided down to the shape of her ample
  breasts against the cotton of her shirt. the scarf swaying back and forth in
  rhythm with her feet. She had her own music, her own song, her own quartet of
  body movements that no man, perhaps long ago but not any more, appreciated.
  She had it all in a tight, subtle package left on a shelf twenty years ago
  waiting for the one man that could see through the cheap wrapping paper to the
  gift hidden beneath. This was what he was waiting his whole life for, this
  woman. This is what he looked at magazines for, watched old movies for and
  yes, snuck out for while his mother held Tupperware parties in the living room
  past his bedtime. He'd studied the hats she might wear, the pleats that might
  be in her skirt, the colors which might collide in the scarf embracing her
  neck.</p>
  <p>With each step she came nearer, his destiny, his Madonna. his Mother Mary.</p>
  <p>&quot;Afternoon, ma'am,&quot; he managed.</p>
  <p>&quot;Afternoon.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;How are you?&quot;</p>
  <p>She paused. His heart leapt to his throat as he realized he was no longer
  in control, that his destiny had taken over and was guiding him into the
  moment of his future, his ultimate purpose, this woman.</p>
  <p>&quot;I must say that right about now I'm doin' very well.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I’m ever so pleased to hear that, ma'am. You look very well, if I
  may say so.&quot; He could hear her breathing, and the minute paused. She
  hadn't turned her face to him yet, and all he could do was watch her lips
  moisten themselves against each other as they prepared to form the next
  response.</p>
  <p>And then, as they began to form she turned her blue eyes on him and they
  sparkled at him.</p>
  <p>&quot;You may, and thank you. You from around here?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I was passin' through, but I thought I might stay for a short while.
  I'm renting a spot upstairs.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes . . .&quot; she looked him up and down. &quot;I would have
  noticed a boy like you before.&quot;</p>
  <p>He could tell how relaxed and comfortable her eyes were with that gesture,
  not from having done it over and over, as a habit, but from having wanted to
  do it so many times and never gone there. Here stood before him the woman who
  was the gown in the closet worn once and forgotten, once loved and so
  beautiful and once the magic was used, hung and forgotten. Here was his prize.</p>
  <p>&quot;It's awful hot out here.&quot; he said.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes, oh my,&quot; she fanned herself and her eyes grew wide with the
  sudden realization. Her cheeks flowered pink.</p>
  <p>&quot;I have some nice cool iced tea upstairs, if you'd like to join me for
  a spell.&quot; His whole body hung upon the balustrade, waiting for her
  answer.</p>
  <p>She looked down the street where she had come from, pensive. Then she
  smiled and looked back him, took his whole face and meaning in.
  &quot;Yes,&quot; she responded. &quot;That would be so nice.&quot;</p>
