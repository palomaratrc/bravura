<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" rowspan=3 width=408><b>The Argument</b>
  <p><b>Tabika T. Rojas</b></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Kara was completely engrossed in their argument. She knew she should mind
  her own business, but the feuding couple had captured her attention almost
  immediately. Actually, if she was to be honest with herself it was the male
  half of the couple that had first piqued her interest.</p>
  <p>He was hard to miss, since he stood at least six feet tall. He had broad
  shoulders and a slight muscular build. It was obvious that he worked out just
  enough to look good but he didn't over-do it. He had short brown hair that
  could only be described as wild. It looked as if had a hard time controlling
  it, but worked on him. The most intriguing things about him were his eyes.
  They were a rich hazel color with flecks of yellow. They were intense eves,
  and yet they held warmth as well.</p>
  <p>He stood in front of her as they waited in line at the movie-theater, and
  he turned to scan the crowd. He was obviously looking for someone, and during
  his search their eyes met. Their gaze held for several seconds, and he gave
  her a slight smile. She returned his smile shyly She stood there looking into
  his eyes, unsure what to do next. She wasn't usually a bashful person, but she
  felt an odd connection with this man that she could not explain. She had never
  seen him before, she was sure of that, but she couldn't shake the feeling of
  familiarity that he awoke in her. She was hesitant to speak, fearful that
  somehow the connection would be severed with words.</p>
  <p>The spell was broken when a gorgeous redhead sauntered up to him and threw
  her arms around his neck. He looked down at his date, and Kara was soon
  forgotten as they began to converse. A wave of disappointment washed over her
  and she reluctantly lowered her gaze. She discreetly listened to the couple
  hoping to discover that the pretty woman was a sister or cousin—anything but
  a girlfriend would be preferable. After awhile it was evident that the couple
  was having a hushed quarrel. Kara felt intense guilt as she took a few baby
  steps closer so she could listen more closely. It was a private conversation
  between two complete strangers, and she knew it was in bad taste to listen,
  but that knowledge didn't stop her. She found herself hoping that the argument
  would end the relationship, and this thought caused another assault of guilt.</p>
  <p>&quot;So, where were you today?&quot; He was asking the woman.</p>
  <p>&quot;What are you talking about, Sam? I was at home of course.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;You lie. I tried to reach you several times; there was no answer. Try
  again.&quot; The sarcasm was evident in his voice.</p>
  <p>&quot;I went out for a couple of hours, so what. I don't have to stay at
  home and wait for your call.&quot;</p>
  <p>The woman turned her back on him, and Kara could sense her anger
  escalating. This had to be better than any movie Kara was going to see. This
  was a real-life drama unfolding right before her eyes. She set aside her guilt
  and silently prayed that the line would proceed slowly, and she could continue
  to eavesdrop on their conversation.</p>
  <p>&quot;You were with him again, weren't you?&quot; He growled in her ear.</p>
  <p>&quot;So what if I was. We work together, Sam, and I can't keep avoiding
  him every time there is an assignment to work on.&quot; She kept her back to
  him only turning her head slightly to throw her words at him.</p>
  <p>&quot;Like hell you can’t Pamela. Get a new partner&quot;.</p>
  <p>&quot;I will not. He's good, and it is rare that I get to work with someone
  so talented. I will not give that up just because you are insecure and
  jealous.&quot; She kept her voice low, but the venom in her tone should have
  been a warning to the man that she was close to losing her temper, yet he
  still pressed on.</p>
  <p>&quot;I am not insecure or jealous!&quot; His voice was no longer a whisper
  and several people were now openly staring at the feuding couple.</p>
  <p>&quot;That's it Sam! I am done having this argument. It is always the same
  with you. Whenever I talk to someone you automatically assume that something
  is going on. If you don't trust me then there is no point in keeping this
  relationship going.&quot; She stepped out of line and stalked down the street.</p>
  <p>It didn't take him long to follow. He caught up to her in two easy strides.
  Several people were shaking their head at the couple in obvious pity, some
  were laughing, and some were actually cheering the couple on.</p>
  <p>Kara watched as their heads disappeared down the street. She had this
  overwhelming need to know how the whole thing was going to turn out. She
  didn't usually follow people around listening in on their private
  conversations, but for some odd reason she was drawn to this couple and she
  wanted to know what was going to happen next. She made a split-second decision
  and bounded out of line, hurrying down the street to catch up to the couple.
  Once she reached them she stayed several steps behind them so she wouldn't be
  noticed. They were so engrossed in their battle, she doubted they would notice
  her even if she bumped right into them.</p>
  <p>&quot;So that's it? Just like that? You're giving up on us after one little
  argument?&quot; He continued his tirade.</p>
  <p>The woman continued to walk down the street, ignoring him as if he were
  some lunatic who suddenly decided to strike up a conversation with an
  unwilling listener. He grabbed her arm and twisted her around to face him.
  Kara quickly stopped to glance in a shop window pretending to be interested in
  something she saw. In actuality, there could have been two mating zebras in
  that window and it wouldn't have distracted her from the couple. She was
  absolutely engrossed in their fight, and she had no idea why it was so
  important to her.</p>
  <p>&quot;Damn it Pamela! Listen to me. How can you give up on us so easily? Do
  I mean so little to you that one simple argument can end something that has
  taken seven years to build? We are engaged, doesn't that mean anything to
  you?&quot; He was still holding onto her arms, and he seemed to be unaware
  that he was shaking her.</p>
  <p>The woman struggled against him and finally broke free of his grasp. For
  the first time Kara really looked at her and was shocked to find fear in her
  expression. Her eyes were wide and she ran a shaky hand through her hair. All
  around them people were steeping aside to avoid them. Kara looked from her
  face to his and she was even more shocked at what she saw in his eyes. He had
  a desperate wild look in his eyes. He didn't seem to notice the people around
  him. He only saw her.</p>
  <p>`Stop this Sam. Please just let me go this time. I can't take this anymore.
  It is the same argument we have been having for years. I can't stay with
  someone who doesn't trust me, and I can't stay with someone that I am afraid
  of.&quot; She took a step away from him and turned to leave. He again grabbed
  her arms and pulled her close to him.</p>
  <p>&quot;I am so sorry about all the times that I have hurt you. Please don't
  hold that against me. It is just that I panic when you start talking about
  leaving me. Don't you know that I would be lost without you? I need you.&quot;
  He let out a choked sob and buried his face in her hair.</p>
  <p>She stood there, stiff and uncaring. She made no move to comfort him. She
  kept her hands at her sides. She refused to touch him.</p>
  <p>&quot;Please let me go this time Sam. I won't stay with you. I won't let
  you hurt me anymore. This time I am leaving, and none of your threats will
  stop me.&quot; She pulled away from him and continued to walk down the street.</p>
  <p>He stood there for several seconds watching her walk away, and then he
  turned to follow her yet again.</p>
  <p>He followed her at a discreet distance and Kara followed him the same way.
  He never made an attempt to stop her; he just kept walking behind her. The
  woman knew he was there. Kara could tell by the guarded way that she walked
  that she was prepared to run if she had to. She stopped at a crosswalk and
  waited for the light to turn green. He moved directly behind her.</p>
  <p>The man glanced down the street and Kara looked to see what had caught his
  attention. She didn't see anything out of the ordinary, just a bus making its
  way down the street. He moved closer to the woman. He stood behind her
  breathing down her neck. He wanted her to know that he was there. The woman
  was nervous. Kara watched her and she could see that she was shaking. To
  anyone else it just looked as if she had caught a chill, but Kara knew that it
  was fear that made her tremble.</p>
  <p>&quot;Pamela, no!&quot; he screamed suddenly, and in that instant Kara knew
  what he was going to do.</p>
  <p>He reached up and shoved her in front of the moving bus. She flew forward
  and the bus struck her, throwing her several feet down the street. There were
  several screams from the crowd and soon chaos erupted. The young man raced
  down the street and kneeled down beside the woman. He was screaming for
  someone to get an ambulance and sobbing hysterically. Kara thought it was a
  pretty good performance. The crowd was gathered around looking down at the
  woman as the young man cradled her lovingly in his arms. The bus driver was
  protesting his innocence loudly.</p>
  <p>&quot;I never saw her, she just came out of nowhere.&quot; He was saying to
  anyone that would listen.</p>
  <p>&quot;I tried to stop her but it was to late. The young man was rocking her
  gently back and forth, and tears were streaming down his face.</p>
  <p>If Kara hadn't known that he pushed her, she would have believed his
  reaction to be that of a genuinely distraught lover. His tears were real, but
  if anyone had bothered to look into his eyes they would have seen it. His eyes
  were void of any emotion. They were the cold eyes of a killer.</p>
  <p>There were sirens in the distance, and soon the police were there. They
  began pushing everyone back, to make room for the ambulance. Two paramedics
  jumped out and pried the poor dead woman from the young mans hands. They tried
  to revive her. They worked frantically to bring her back to life, but in the
  end it was all for nothing. She was dead and dead she would stay.</p>
  <p>The police began to question everyone, and their stories were all the same.
  They all claimed that she had stepped off the curb without looking. Her poor
  fiancé had tried to stop her but he was too late. After questioning several
  witnesses the police began to wrap up their investigation. They covered the
  woman up, and soon the coroner came to take her to a morgue.</p>
  <p>Kara lost sight of the man and searched the dwindling crowd for him. She
  located him in the back seat of a police car. He was being consoled by a group
  of cops. They were telling him that there was nothing he could have done. It
  wasn't his fault. Kara knew otherwise.</p>
  <p>Kara started to walk toward the police officers intent on telling them what
  she knew, and that's when it happened. He looked up at her. He stared at her
  with a strange familiarity.</p>
  <p>Kara stopped walking and stared back at him. She was unable to look away. A
  slow smile spread across his face. He was warning her with his eyes, she was
  sure of it. Kara took several cautious steps forward. The smile on his face
  spread wider and he gently shook his head at her. She froze in mid-step, and
  fear began to make her heart beat faster.</p>
  <p>This was impossible. There was no way he could have known that she was
  following him. If he had known, he would never have killed her. Kara took
  several steps backward, never taking her eyes off of him.</p>
  <p>He nodded his head in approval and mouthed several words to her. She
  couldn't believe it. It was as if he was standing behind her whispering in her
  ear. She heard his words clearly.</p>
  <p>That's a good girl.&quot; That's what he said.</p>
  <p>Kara took several more steps backward, bumping into several people in her
  haste to get away. He kept his eyes glued to her. A police officer offered to
  give him a ride home, and suddenly that imitation look of grief came back to
  his face. He reluctantly tore his eyes away from her and accepted the offer.
  They closed his door and drove away.</p>
  <p>He watched her out the window as they drove by. His smile returned, and
  Kara knew that it was an unspoken promise that they would see each other
  again. He was coming for her. Kara wasn't sure how she knew this, but she did.
  She was inexplicably drawn to him right from the start. There was an unusual
  connection between them. He had been aware that she was following him the
  whole time.</p>
  <p>As the car disappeared around the corner Kara could still feel his eyes on
  her. She could still hear his words. &quot;That's a good girl.&quot; Yes, she
  would definitely see him again and she was very afraid.</p>
