<!-- ------------------CONTENTS------------------ --><b>Off to School</b>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b>by Derek Scefonas</b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">I let out a subatomic whistle. The spyder awakens. It
  stretched out each leg. Each one the articulation of speculation and
  education. A sliver strand, like god-spun angel hair, and it lowers itself
  onto my face. Soft touch as it passes over my eye. It slides to my ear and
  enters. I begin to feel the web it weaves in my brain. Old connections
  restrung. New ones laced with laughter. The lattice works across my eyes. A
  mirror web wink and I'm gone...</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">A fuzzy haze and the smell of the lawn holocaust and I am
  outside. A group of orange clad monks walk not next to me, but inside my mind.
  They chant the morning call to prayer. They were brought by my spyder and
  housed in the gossamer temple of my occipital lobe. The dust rises from the
  dead grass field diminutive dust clouds called into being by the shuffling of
  my feet. I reach the crossroads where the shuttle picks up those of us with a
  low-band connection. Meanwhile the monks have uncovered a hidden tomb in the
  monastery and what lies within I can only guess, but it must be the pounding
  backbeat Buddha of compassion, cause I'm awake. High-speed busybodies in slick
  metallic shells whir by, an occasional watchdog watches. BIZARE cries a mind
  monk and then sets himself on fire while pointing at the approaching shuttle.
  I stand up, signaling my intention to hitch a ride on the low-band shuttle.
  Quiet now except for the 4/4 beat of my heart and the high hat of my mind. I
  reach in my pocket for the offering as the double doors of the shuttle swing
  open folding as the metallic wings of the angel of death. A creek, hiss and
  the scent of well-worn industrial rubber and flesh tell me I am on the right
  shuttle. I look through graffiti covered eyes onto the world. I see the
  cutting of the ground. The sound it makes is of a thunder crash and a looping,
  drowning wail of a wicked woman who lived near the watershed.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The Christian savior stares at me from the
  backwards-turned hat of a fellow passenger. Christos is swaying to the
  pounding of the rainforest drums. Arms eternally outstretched wanting to
  enfold you. Does he ever get tired standing on the brim of that baseball hat?
  A voice like Vlad the Impaler comes from the old man sitting next to me.
  &quot;Twenty years ago O was banned from homeland, parted from my wife and
  son. Never to see them again. Cause I dared to use atom elements to producing
  super beings. Beings of untinkable strength and silence. I was branded a
  madman and a charlatan. Outlawed in the world of science, which previously
  honored me as a genius. Oh fear and desperate shame, I curse you all to hell.
  I have proven that I am almighty.&quot; I was going to say something. I wasn't
  sure what. I mean, what do you say to a megalomaniac biotech genius with a
  messianic complex. Then from within my ancient broken Chinese jade heart came
  the following, &quot;wow, that must suck.&quot;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">He nodded his translucent head and asked, &quot;Vould you
  have a cigarette?&quot;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">I shook my head, &quot;No, they don't work here.&quot;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&quot;I know,&quot; his voice like a muddy paddle,
  &quot;but it's fun to ask.&quot;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The sound of a whale farting through 15 layers of
  philosophical fog ended the conversation. The shuttle had reached my
  destination. I was ay Palomar. This is not a test. Is this reality? Worldwide
  and wide-awake I stride. Community College construct V.1.1.1.1.1. The sun
  burns down like a gravel sound. The Asian artists seem to surround with Manga
  hairdos and Bozuku driven frowns. Rabbits of forgotten fame pass by with
  frightened memories of native hunters buried in the genetic memory.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Yellow stripe to Red past a jungle of Green. To the clock
  tower, tick-tock, tick-tock, almost unseen, pump it up now with the nature.
  Low quarter circle walls of brick cry out, &quot;Danger, all you have to do is
  be calm,&quot; or is it become? I'm not too sure 'cause a wide breeze blew
  that thought out of my head. I watched it go. It flew past a red and yellow
  flag and ended up in a Hello Kitty backpack that was lying on the steps of the
  student union. Soon to be picked up by a lost raver kid from 15 years ago
  whose teeth fell out forming a bracelet around his wrist that spelled his
  name.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Meanwhile a fellow student has sat down near me, she
  looks at me through blue tinted bangs and forgotten galaxies.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">I say, &quot; It's hard to survive in a world of
  destruction. Tough when you are young, needing assistance or justice. Open
  your eyes to the devastation that is this.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">She replies, once I had a dream. We were young and once
  invincible: I lost focus.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Once I had a dream: I was young and full of arrogance</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Once I had a dream: I was dragging your body somewhere.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">It is tough at the top.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Tougher at the bottom.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">It is hard to survive in a world of destruction.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Open your eyes to the devastation that is this.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">I turned my head. Looking over my shoulder, checking out
  the dead people left behind. Doesn't everyone like the taste of gasoline? I
  got nowhere to go. Oh yea I do. I get up and with a nod to the once fellow
  Invincible I head over to the student union. Pass the people with no classes,
  bouncing bodies and cold, cold, cold thoughts to the side entrance. Up and to
  my left before I open the door I glance. Random lines and swirls draw me in. A
  psychogenetic trance-like piece of art hangs there. It is alone and random. I
  reach out and touch it to see if its there or just a glitch in the system. My
  index finger stretches out. It starts swirling, mixing becoming another swirl
  in the pattern. My feet are still firmly planted on concrete, but not for
  long. The rubber souls of my sneakers break free from gravity and I begin to
  melt. I become another swirl. I am liquid. I am viscous and viscous. I am the
  slayer of dreams and my biochemical structure has been designed to join in
  chemical conditioning my body has been trained since childhood to become
  excited by this. Now we can begin. The chemical configurations of this
  creation and myself must balance. The view is breathtaking. This is strange. I
  should feel a balance beginning. A voice. &quot;I seem to feel something. Long
  have I hung here unnoticed and forgotten. Now you come. Come, come, come, come
  with me.&quot; Icy cold that streaks through what was once my body and my soul
  and I am transported and transformed into another universe. It is a universe
  of sound and liquid laughter. I watch with it. &quot;We must join in chemical
  conditioning,&quot; it says. I watch as particles of life explode outward
  forming galaxies, nebulas, stars, planets, comets...life. It is so much more
  than static being. It is more than randomness. It is more than order, order,
  order, order, order...</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">An &quot;Excuse me,&quot; and a tap on my shoulder.
  &quot;Do you want to order?&quot;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Corporeal being once more I reply, &quot;Yes, one
  breakfast burrito.&quot;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">She hands me a number -37. I wait till it is called, take
  the wrapped burrito and then I pour a cup of coffee. I pay and take my
  insignificant feast to the grassy area outside the library. I finish but
  hunger still remains. &quot;Is it real?&quot; I ask once more. A voice robotic
  and effected answers from some exotic realm of my mind.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Deep Space...Abandoned. Any survivors?&quot;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&quot;No&quot;, I answer as I shoulder my backpack and
  climb into the cavern.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The scent of long dead authors and hidden cabbalist
  knowledge assaults my olfactory opening. I climb more stairs. In a back
  corner, hanging from the wall are the twin bloodshot eyes of god. They sit
  upon a pool of languid blue.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&quot;What is happening?&quot; A monk or is it the monkey
  of my mind asks.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Something wonderful&quot;, is the countersign.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">In the distant shack that lies abandoned in a forlorn
  field my brain, an ancient, sits down at a piano and begins to play 5 notes
  over and over. He weaves them into a tapestry, which he places upon my soul to
  keep it insulated from the cold grip of God's gaze.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">I look deep into the twin pools of red. I am slipping and
  twisting once more drawn into something that is neither more nor less than
  myself. I remove the cloak and dive in. Harp string songs break the surface
  and in the next moment the lotus finds the strength to blossom. The river of
  time begins to flow backwards and I step into the same place...twice. Then
  again...and again. &quot;It is all just an endless recurrence of a single
  thought played out in innumerable ways. Beware the trap of the soul that grows
  in the eyes... this time, time, time, Ime, I'm late for class.</p>
