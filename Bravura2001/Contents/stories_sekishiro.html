  <p><b>By L. S. Sekishiro</b></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Olive green tea leaves swirled about, rushing though hot water and nudging
  each other before taking their predestined places at the bottom of the white
  porcelain cup. Madame Quo peered over the lip and what she read through the
  bronze-colored brew caused tiny beads of sweat to form across her brow.</p>
  <p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
  <p>The tarnished bell over the glass-framed wooden door rang out announcing
  the arrival of another customer. Quo's Teashop at l0u' and Main had sold
  exotic teas and blends imported from China since 1941. A ceiling fan hummed,
  circulating stale air infused by a melange of dried aromatic leaves. Faded
  green paint chipped from every wall. Madame Quo rose from a stool behind the
  counter to greet her client, wincing before reaching her full height of four
  feet and eleven inches. <i>Ai, my back! Perhaps more of my special blend would
  help. I must remember to prepare some later. </i>She hobbled toward the cash
  register, hands clutched at her waist massaging her lower back through a
  simple cotton print smock.</p>
  <p>A petite woman dressed in a fuchsia silk suit rushed in, calling out,
  &quot;Quo!&quot; Her heavy floral perfume interrupted the fragrance of the
  teashop.</p>
  <p>&quot;Ah! Councilwoman Yee! Such a pleasure to see you again. I have your
  mother's order right here.&quot; The shopkeeper retrieved a brown
  paper-wrapped package from under the aged Formica counter top.</p>
  <p>&quot;That's a full ounce, right?&quot; The ambitious young politician
  snapped. Her irritation was no small remnant from last night's city council
  meeting. Councilwoman Yee's main platform during last year's election had been
  the redevelopment of the downtown area. But because of Madame Quo and several
  other old-timers' refusal to relocate, as recent as yesterday, she had yet to
  make good on those promises.</p>
  <p>The shopkeeper was hurt by the city official's insinuation. She had never
  tipped the scales in her favor. And she always offered a free tea reading
  &quot;for good measure&quot;. From atop the ancient register she pulled down
  an abacus, flicked the loose disks and turned the apparatus toward the young
  woman.</p>
  <p>&quot;Never mind.&quot; The councilwoman waved a hand through the air
  dismissing the telling beads, something she never took the time to learn.
  &quot;Here's my mother's money.&quot; She slipped a fat white envelope across
  the counter.</p>
  <p>&quot;Thank you, Councilwoman. Please tell your mother. . . &quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm only here because my mother asked me to pick up her tea for
  her,&quot; Ms. Yee interrupted. &quot;She swears by it, but you and I both
  know there's nothing to your so-called `special ancient Chinese blends'.
  You're nothing but a con artist, Quo,&quot; the young woman started,
  continuing her tirade from last night.</p>
  <p>&quot;How is your mother, by the way?&quot; Madame Quo asked, wanting to
  change the subject. She turned toward a battered TV tray behind her. <i>Ai,
  the younger generations! 7hey have such disrespect for the old </i>ways! From
  the small table she took two white porcelain cups and a thermos of hot water.
  She reached into a jar on the counter and produced pinches of dried olive
  green tea that she sprinkled into the vessels. &quot;Let's have some
  refreshment. I'll read your leaves. Free, of course.&quot;</p>
  <p>The impatient woman eyed the shopkeeper with suspicion, but her curiosity
  had been piqued. She placed her slim leather day bag on the counter. &quot;My
  mother is fine. Her doctor calls it a medical miracle, but I say she's just in
  remission. For some reason she believes it's this concoction of yours that's
  seems to have cured her.&quot; She reached for a cup.</p>
  <p>Madame Quo tapped the top of the bejeweled and manicured hand. &quot;Not
  yet, be patient. Let the leaves settle.&quot; She glanced at her customer. <i>Ai,
  such a disgrace to the Yee </i></font><font FACE="Garamond" SIZE="4"><i>family</i>!</p>
  </font><font SIZE="3">
  <p>The councilwoman, with lips pursed and arms folded across her tailored
  suit, leaned against the counter and watched the dried foliage twist and turn
  its random dance. Madame Quo stood rubbing her back but froze when she saw the
  star pattern begin to form.</p>
  <p>&quot;Quo! What's the matter with you? Why are you sweating all of a
  sudden? And your face is red,&quot; the councilwoman shouted.</p>
  <p>Madame Quo wiped her damp brow with the back of her hand.</p>
  <p>&quot;Quo! What is it?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;You don't have much time. . .&quot; She blinked her eyes in
  disbelief.</p>
  <p>&quot;Don't have much time for what?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;You . . .you . . .&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I'll tell you what I don't have much time for. It's this ancient
  Chinese mumbojumbo crap of yours.&quot; The young woman picked up her teacup.
  Madame Quo reached across the counter but was unable to prevent her from
  taking the hot liquid in one gulp. &quot;I'm going to have a thorough
  investigation done on your shop, Quo, and with the results you'll be out of
  business. Have a nice day.&quot; The councilwoman slammed down the cup, picked
  up her bag, scooped up her mother's package and stormed out of the teashop.</p>
  <p>That's when Madame Quo heard the deafening sound of screeching tires.</p>
