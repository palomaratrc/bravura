  Markers</b></font>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>by Elizabeth M Taylor</b></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The first thing I did every morning
  was examine my purse to make sure nothing was missing. Satisfied today that my
  markers were still there, I lovingly put them back. A woman-in-white entered
  my room, cheerfully greeting me with a good morning Darlene. They all dressed
  in white, these people whose names I've forgotten. And the walls, curtains,
  and furniture in my room were all white. I didn't like the monotonous,
  mind-numbing whiteness; it was depressing. I despised this place.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The woman-in-white helped me bathe
  and get dressed, chattering, saying nothing I was interested in hearing. Still
  damp from my bath, I reached for my tiny yellow blanket, which had fallen to
  the floor, and wrapped my shoulders tightly with it. I remembered how the
  people-in- white tried to take my yellow blanket away from me. &quot;It is
  filthy and needs laundering,&quot; each one of them would say. But I would
  kick and claw and scream at them, for fear of not seeing that yellow blanket
  again. They would then leave me alone, but I knew, oh I just knew, that they
  would take my blanket away while I was in a drugged sleep. Each morning I
  would find it somewhere else instead of on my bed. It would be on the chair,
  or draped over the footboard, or on the floor.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I was fed my meals. I couldn't feed
  myself well. Once, I was handed an item and had forgotten what it was.
  &quot;It's a fork,&quot; I was told. I couldn't remember what to do with it,
  and like all items that had lost their meaning for me, I dropped it. Now I had
  to be fed because they gave up trying to teach me to eat and they were tired
  of cleaning up the mess. &quot;For cryin' out loud, Darlene, just eat,&quot;
  they would beg me. I dawdled; I was not interested in eating, the food was
  tasteless, and I was frequently nauseated from the odor. But then I would eat,
  just so they would leave me alone.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And I had to stay in my room each
  morning now. I was grounded. All because of a misunderstanding. It was that
  blue ceramic vase. I saw it in one of the women resident's rooms. It had the
  exact shade and luminosity as Niina's eyes, a deep dark cobalt blue. I
  couldn't believe my luck when I saw it! I had been on the lookout for that
  particular shade, and the spartan and dull décor here didn't help. And there
  it was, within my reach.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It really stood out from all the
  whiteness. Entering the room and seeing two other flower-filled vases, I knew
  she wouldn't mind my having the blue one. So I dumped the water-soaked flowers
  out and hid the vase in my gown. Oh, the flimsy gown. I was caught.
  &quot;Darlene made a mess out of my bed and took my vase!&quot; screamed the
  owner, and in the tug-of-war with her I dropped it. Two people-in-white
  dragged me back to my room and told me I was grounded. &quot;Darlene needs to
  be watched more closely. She's hoarding again,&quot; I heard one of them say.
  Well it was not the blue vase I needed; it was the color.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Later that afternoon I was allowed
  out and I quietly and carefully looked into each trash can until I found the
  shards. Just one tiny shard is all I wanted; one tiny piece to hold in my palm
  and put in my purse. One insignificant item that no one would miss, but meant
  hanging on to my humanity. I cannot, must not, forget Niina.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Niina. My baby. Thank God I could
  still remember her name, which was the one thing I remembered my husband and I
  ever agreed on. It was her face I'd begun to worry about. I remembered her
  bright and curly yellow hair and her wide, almond shaped blue eyes, but it was
  as if her face was being erased. I could no longer remember how tall she was
  or what her smile looked like, or if she had freckles. Niina.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She was born at a time when society
  and the medical establishment knew next to nothing about her condition, except
  to recommend an institution. But I would not be persuaded to put her in one of
  those places in spite of the advice of well-meaning doctors, and in spite of
  what others usually did at that time. I visited such a place, and I was glad I
  did. It was supposed to be better than most. It was horrid. The patients that
  could walk were herded like cattle, silent, avoiding any eye contact with the
  staff or each other. The babies, usually wet and weeping, stayed in cold metal
  cribs all day. There was nothing for the patients; no school, no playground,
  no toys, no music, no colors, no smiles, no hugs, nothing. The uncovered
  windows were sooty, the floors and bare white walls were grimy, the food was
  ill-prepared, and the employees were callous and without pity. I felt so sorry
  for the patients, and I was horrified at the idea of my own daughter being one
  of them.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">She was tiny and fragile and
  frequently in and out of the hospital with breathing problems. She was only
  three, and so sick with pneumonia the last time, that her damaged heart just
  couldn't take it any more. I remembered sitting by her bedside, sobbing and
  bargaining with heaven and hell and everyone in between, that she might live.
  &quot;Oh, God, I don't want to lose her,&quot; I would wail out loud until the
  nurses and my husband would take me away.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My husband. The cheat. I remembered
  him being handsome, and ten years younger than me. I was embarrassed to admit
  it, but I was flattered that he would focus his attentions on me. I should
  have known better. The hardness in his eyes never matched his smile or his
  words. He knew how to charm people into giving him what he wanted, and people
  did. Including me. A stage actor, his sudden stardom got the best of him, and
  he cheated on me. Rehearsals, he said, when I asked him why he was rarely
  home. I called the theater from the hospital one evening because I was
  exhausted and needed him to drive me home. He was not there. I was given a
  number, and a woman answered. I never cared to see him again after that day.
  But he was clever. And I hated cleverness, especially in him! He used my love
  and concern for Niina to worm his way back. After all, he said, it would be in
  Niina's best interest to have us together. It will take the two of us, he
  said, to raise a sick child like Niina. She needed a father in her life, he
  said, and he loved her. We could start all over again, he said, and it would
  give Niina a strong chance of making it. He's in love with me, he said, and
  the other woman meant nothing to him. So like a bad joke he came back to me
  and my daughter died.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My train of thought was interrupted
  by the woman-in- white, reminding me to go to the bathroom. Yeah, that's
  regimented here, too. I guess I'd had one accident too many. And I easily lose
  track of time. Now I'm reminded every so often to go.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The lobby was at the other end of the
  hall. I occasionally went there when I was allowed to leave my room, although
  I was not supposed to go there and a person-in-white would steer me back. The
  furniture was upholstered in dark green. There were several plants in large
  terracotta pots on the floor, and several more hanging on knotted ropes. The
  floor had a textured brown carpeting. The walls, painted in beige, had big
  framed photographs of various cityscapes and people hanging from them. That's
  where I wanted to go today, to see the photographs. I liked them. I would
  stand up close to look at them, and wondered about who the people were and
  where they lived.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There was one particular framed piece
  which unnerved me each time I saw it. I wanted to avoid it, but I was drawn to
  it somehow, and I just had to see it yet again. It was of an old woman with
  short hair the color of sand. Her eyes had that mixture of sadness and
  suspicion, and they followed me around the room. She looked pathetic, unloved,
  and familiar. Sometimes, when I would look at her, she seemed to want to ask
  me a question, or tell me her story, or warn me of an impending tragedy. I
  felt pity for her, yet at the same time I was rattled by her.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I finally asked a woman-in-white
  sitting behind a desk if the woman in the photograph once lived here. She
  said, &quot;Darlene, that's only a mirror. You're seeing yourself.&quot;
  Dismayed, I told her that I didn't look like that. That woman wasn't me; she
  couldn't be. When did my light brown hair turn into that color? When did my
  face turn sunken, ashen, and wrinkled? Looking around the earth-tone décor, I
  felt so out of place. Worse, I felt as if I was in the wrong time. What
  happened to the last ten years? To the last few months? To yesterday morning?
  There was such a gap between now and maybe ten years ago that I couldn't
  account for. I wanted to remember, and I started to cry. The woman-in-white
  led me back to my room.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And yet...</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I can remember when my hair wasn't
  the color of sand and my fingers weren't crooked and painful. I had long light
  brown hair at a time when many women were cutting theirs very short. I was not
  conventional in my clothes, preferring them loose and long, rejecting the
  cashmere sweaters and thin skirts that were in vogue. I had painted my own
  fabrics, with colors and patterns inspired by my travels in Asia and the
  Middle East. My apartment was a riot of colors. I had painted the jewel-toned
  drapes in the living room, and the murals on the walls in the hall. There was
  a fireplace which had a golden fire all year, even during the summer, because
  it made the living room cosy and peaceful. My bedroom wallpaper was covered
  with big red cabbage roses, and the floor had a thick plush red rug that made
  my toes disappear. The windows were big and they let in the city at night.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I painted. I remembered that. I
  painted right out of paint tubes using bright colors and big brushes, and many
  people liked my work. Yes, I was a woman who painted at a time when most
  successful painters were men. And I made enough money with my art, but my
  husband would squander it in half-baked multi-level schemes when he couldn't
  get decent acting parts. When Niina became gravely ill it meant putting aside
  my art. That didn't sit well with him, and in one of our many fights he said
  the most despicable thing to hurt me: &quot;Hey, there are no mongoloids in MY
  family!&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">At her funeral I promised to never
  ever forget her. But I got busy. I got busy living and trying to bury the pain
  of her death. I painted wildly and furiously, accepting practically every
  commission I was offered, and travelling every chance I could. My husband and
  I, though married, led separate lives. He eventually opened an acting school,
  and he even tried to reach out to me, but at some point I simply got tired of
  his games. Living on my own again, I began to paint Niina's portrait, but I
  didn't finish, because it was during this time that I noticed changes in my
  memory.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I didn't pay attention at first. I
  would misplace my glasses and forget appointments. I would forget where I
  parked the car. That happened to everyone everyday, I reasoned. But then,
  talking became embarrassing when I'd forget words in midsentence. Using the
  telephone became difficult. I couldn't remember the phone numbers that I
  frquently called, and I consulted my address book more and more, until I
  misplaced that, too. I had a painful time looking at my photo albums. Who were
  those people? Family? Friends? I couldn't remember them. I blamed it on
  stress, but when I could no longer drive, the doctors called it early-onset
  with rapid progression and poor prognosis, whatever that meant. And when the
  kitchen caught on fire because I forgot that the stove was on, I was placed
  here.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The woman-in-white came in my room
  again to take me to the patio right outside the lobby. I loved the patio best
  of all. There were many trees whose overhanging branches made dappled shadows
  over a sprawling, thick green lawn. The sounds of footsteps and squeaky
  wheelchairs were muffled, and people's voices were gentler. The air moved and
  smelled good, and made pleasant noices of the leaves. The wide sky was clear
  and peaceful this evening.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Sitting in the shade, I took out each
  marker from my purse. I created my markers, as I called them, because I've
  already forgotten many significant people in my life. And with Niina, it was
  almost too late. I couldn't remember her birthday, which at one time was
  unimaginable. I couldn't remember if she talked. Did she ever say
  &quot;mom&quot;? What did she like to eat? Did she have a favorite toy? I
  hated myself for forgetting.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">My markers. They were not easy to
  get, and I was frequently in trouble because of them, but they were mine now,
  and I fought to keep them. I kept them in my purse, which I carried with me
  everywhere. Each one marked something wonderful. There was the dark blue
  shard, a color that matched her dramatic and expressive eyes. I remembered her
  eyes at times clear and luminous, at other times tearful and filled with
  weariness, rimmed with thick lashes, and closed tight in her sleep. The tiny
  yellow blanket reminded me of her curly golden hair, her cheerful room with
  the yellow ducks that I had painted on the walls, and the way she felt in my
  arms when I rocked her in the dark with just the glow of the nightlight. The
  half-empty salt shaker was when we took her to the country one sunny winter
  and it had started to snow and she laughed out loud because she had loved it
  so much. A set of keys, like a set of chimes that I hung in her room, which
  when I opened the door would make the chimes softly play and it made her
  smile, only now I had a hard time picturing her smile. An empty container of
  talcum powder reminded me of playful bathtimes and bedtimes and her good night
  kisses. Five items. Five? I was sure I had more. Wait. I looked in my purse
  again. It was empty. Five items. I was so sure I had more...</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I quickly put them back in my purse
  when I was approached by a fat, stubby-looking man. He came just before dark
  to feed me dinner and read to me. His presence immediately clouded the entire
  patio. He was condescending towards the woman-in-white, and he had a hardness
  in his eyes that didn't match the smile on his lips when he spoke to me. There
  was no tenderness in the way he took my hand into his; his grasp inflicted
  pain. I was not happy to see him.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">His presence and the approaching
  darkness made me restless, and I started to pace. Darkness meant sleep and I
  liked sleep the least of all because it meant waking up to a new loss. The
  stubby-looking man took me back to my room, and he began to read to me. I
  couldn't sit still and continued to pace, this time more vigorously and
  noisily. I must have annoyed him, because he stood up to leave.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I took out each marker to remember
  again. The tiny yellow blanket, the empty container, the shard, the salt
  shaker, andandsomething. A collection of cold metal. What was it? Oh
  God, what was it? I believed it was-wait. Think, Darlene, think! I dropped it
  and screamed. I couldn't remember. I couldn't remember!</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Niina! Oh God, I don't want to
  lose her!&quot; I screamed. The stubby-looking man ran back in with the
  woman-in-white.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Niina's been gone for twenty
  years now, honey,&quot; he said, while they forced me to lie down. She gave me
  a shot, but in my struggle it caused me a great deal of pain.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Her sundown agitation has
  become a daily thing lately. And we would find her in the middle of the night
  confused and wandering the halls or trying to get out through the patio
  doors,&quot; I heard the woman-in-white say, while we fought for my purse. She
  won, but not before I spat at her and scratched her arms. She immediately took
  out my yellow blanket and covered me with it, then gave me back my purse. She
  then tended to her scratches. The stubby-looking man picked something up from
  the floor.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Look at this. I've had to get a
  whole new set of keys about two months ago and she's had these all
  along,&quot; the stubby-looking man said, annoyed.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Can't you people do something
  about her thievin'?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">He glared at me and shook his head.
  They both put the side rails up around my bed and turned the lights down, and
  I watched them leave. Still clutching my purse, I started to feel groggy. And
  before I faded into sleep, I reached inside my purse and grabbed the blue
  shard that matched her haunting blue eyes and clenched it tight.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Niina. Oh, Niina...</font></p>
