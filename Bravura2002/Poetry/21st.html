Ornament Premeire, 2001<br>
Erika Bales<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>
The store is framed in red and<br>
Through the glossy picture-windows<br>
A red-suited man ho-ho-hos to passersby,<br>
Waving his fuzzy mitten,<br>
Mechanically happy.<br>
For although it’s ninety degrees<br>
Outside, inside it’s Christmas,<br>
Complete with plastic garland and silver-plated bells.<br>
Ornaments are hung in the display with care,<br>
In hopes that crazed shoppers soon will appear.<br>
And boy, do they ever<br>
Until the ravaged remains of the <br>
Cheery, gold display<br>
sadly contain a few scattered boxes.<br>
 <br>
Collecting is part of the <br>
Spirit of the season.<br>
Well known songs, mingling with shouting,<br>
Waltz out of the speakers, their tinniness<br>
Only adding to the glory<br>
Of that man in frayed shorts, with a gut<br>
And a beard reminiscent of Santa<br>
Who happened to be<br>
First in line.<br>
The day wears on and darkness closes around the shop,<br>
Pricked only by twinkling strings of light.<br>
But none will outshine<br>
The distant North Star.<br>
