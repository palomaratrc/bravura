Ian Beattie</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>
<br>
I gaze ‘cross the room and see her standing there;<br>
She is all of five foot with long flowing hair.<br>
It cascades around her like a soft waterfall,<br>
And the smile from her lips lights up this dim hall.<br>
<br>
I open my mind to wild thoughts as they stream,<br>
Bubbling forth fantasies as in a daydream.<br>
I imagine her held in my arms like a vise,<br>
Breaking the bounds of my own good advice.<br>
<br>
So I reach for her hand as I near to her side,<br>
An electrical spark pricks like sharpened raphide.<br>
Her sensual looks make my nape hair arise,<br>
Arousing my senses, and my knees rubberize<br>
.<br>
The heat of her skin makes me flinch to her touch,<br>
But I warm to her mood, as her body I clutch.<br>
Her arms do engulf me as the room disappears;<br>
I’m no longer controlled by my shyness and fears.<br>
<br>
Our feet start a motion; dance steps then unfold.<br>
We skim o’er the floor, quite a sight to behold.<br>
So fluid, so smooth, as my heart sets the beat,<br>
Two bodies as one, taking the lead from my feet.<br>
<br>
As the rhythm sets in and takes over control,<br>
I get even bolder, not afraid of Sheol.<br>
My hands start to roam, her bare back they embrace,<br>
I focus intently, try to read from her face.<br>
<br>
The sparkle I see and the grin on her lip,<br>
Just urges me onward like the crack from a whip.<br>
In a wordless embrace, my eyes then meet hers.<br>
I feel like a stallion prodded on by her spurs.<br>
<br>
Her eyes are deep pools, that urge me to swim,<br>
To drink of her waters and give in to her whim.<br>
They sparkle and shine, and entice like none other,<br>
Like some witch’s deep spell that seeks me to smother.<br>
<br>
Like a blind man my fingers reach out for to trace,<br>
The hillocks and valleys that her visage do grace.<br>
Her lips, they entrance me, like the crest of a wave,<br>
Opening to engulf me, to make me their slave.<br>
<br>
The soft, down-like shafts of that so faint lip hair,<br>
Heightens my passion that is coming to bear.<br>
Small, sensual, dew beads to her lip do hold fast.<br>
Can I hold myself back?  How long can I last?<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">My spirit arises; I’m 
awash in her glow.<br>
She clutches my heart, and then kneads it like dough.<br>
Does she know what I’m thinking, for what I do pine,<br>
Of that cold, sensual shiver that shoots up my spine?<br>
<br>
<span> </span>My palms start to sweat; my heart pounds my chest,<br>
Just like a young schoolboy upon his first quest.<br>
Can she feel my arousal in this amateur ballet,<br>
Stepping and swaying, making ancient foreplay?<br>
<br>
Our bodies like velcro, move in union, as one;<br>
Pelvises enjoined, my fate now is spun,<br>
Like the thread of a goddess, of that ancient Greek myth,<br>
As it holds my soul fast like some archaic willow withe.<br>
<br>
I let my cheek rest on her soft wispy hair,<br>
Taking in her aroma, she’s not playing fair.<br>
She smells like new lavender, cut fresh from the bush.<br>
She’s in league with the Devil, if shove comes to push.<br>
<br>
But my head bows still lower, that curve now to find,<br>
The soft of her neck, so enticing, streamlined. <br>
My lips on their own, they start to caress,<br>
As they follow the lead of my hands in her dress.<br>
<br>
The small of her back is so soft and so lean,<br>
No bra strap to trap me, no need for my sgian.<br>
A soft guttural moan does escape from her lips;<br>
A movement I detect in the sway of her hips.<br>
<br>
But my fear now returns since we’re not here alone,<br>
And due to her closeness, my passion has grown.<br>
Her hips are now grinding like a fertility rite,<br>
And I’m glad this room’s gloomy, like the shadowy night.<br>
<br>
<span> </span>Losing sense of the time and not caring at all,<br>
That we may be viewed, as we glide through this hall,<br>
I start to undress her, to view of her charms,<br>
While holding her tightly in my trembling arms.<br>
<br>
Her beauty unfolds as her bodice falls free;<br>
Her breasts feel so tender as they beckon to me.<br>
Her limbs are so lithe, deep tanned, curved and smooth.<br>
This fire burning in me I simply must soothe.<br>
<br>
Then all of a sudden in my chest do I feel,<br>
A nagging sharp pain that makes my head reel.<br>
With a start, my eyes open and shock rouses me,<br>
As I awaken abruptly from my sweet reverie.<br>
<br>
My wife lies beside me with this look on her face,<br>
That questions my passion, as its length she does trace.<br>
With that same wicked grin that I’d seen in my dream,<br>
She crawls in beside me, to fulfill her shrewd scheme.<br>
