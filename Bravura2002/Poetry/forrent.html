  Brian Ramuno</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  This space for rent<br>
  I should have required a deposit up front<br>
  Everyone else checks the credit history<br>
  Before the space is occupied<br>
  The tenant moved in and right out<br>
  Didn't care much to save much<br>
  Leaving trails of sadness </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">All over the room<br>
  I can't afford that cleaning bill<br>
  Door hinges are broken<br>
  They won't open for a while<br>
  The insides are torn apart<br>
  How could one person </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Do so much damage<br>
  I never expected to clean this mess<br>
  I thought the tenant cared<br>
  Replace the light bulbs, fix the sink<br>
  The fridge is broken<br>
  But still seems cold inside<br>
  The place is where it was,<br>
  But feels like it's been stolen<br>
  Didn't even recognize it at first<br>
  I can't find my way back, but <br>
  I will think twice </font></p>

  This space for rent<br>
  Posted on my heart<br>
  I'm glad it wasn't for sale</font></p>
