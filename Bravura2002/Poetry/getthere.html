The town waits right on Old 99<br>
(if you remember that long ago),<br>
so everyone bound for Medford or Eugene<br>
or even Tacoma had to go straight through.<br>
Then the freeway double bypassed <br>
the main artery of the town.<br>
Now you really have to want to go there<br>
or else you may end up in Montague<br>
or maybe even Gazelle,<br>
much smaller towns<br>
where hardly anything happens,<br>
except, perhaps, the Firemen’s Ball.<br>
I always just drove until the place showed up.<br>
That’s what I did when I returned<br>
for Yreka High’s reunion.<br>
Things looked pretty much the same.<br>
Without success, I sought the Fourth Street house<br>
kitty-corner from my kindergarten class,<br>
but I did catch a whiff of the<br>
heavy-headed lilacs, lavender and pearl,<br>
nodding off in the summer’s haze,<br>
and a glimpse of the baby-hued abalone<br>
that had washed up from the ocean of<br>
Grandma’s garden.<br>
Even though I looked carefully<br>
as I drove down Main Street,<br>
somehow I missed Con Brown’s,<br>
where murmured conversations<br>
<span> </span>were punctuated by the slap <br>
of cards in the back room<br>
on bright spring mornings<br>
when my sister and I ventured timidly <br>
into the cramped emporium<br>
to purchase Dad’s Sunday paper, <i>The</i> <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>.<br>
Wasn’t the Yreka Drug down on the corner of Broadway Street?<br>
Where we spun on the stools after school<br>
watching the counter girl make YD toast,<br>
 a dime’s worth of delicious <br>
which the cool kids ate with a cherry coke.<br>
Slapping melted butter on a Wonder bread slice,<br>
wielding a soft bristled brush<br>
then thwack, she diagonalized it with a butcher knife.<br>
I looked up and down the street but couldn’t spot<br>
the steep-staired office of old Dr. Kleaver<br>
where Novacaine was king and he the court jester.<br>
My teeth still ache in remembrance<br>
each time a blank key is drilled.<br>
I can’t be sure<br>
but I think I caught a glance,<br>
just out of the corner of my eye,<br>
of our hometown bake shop <br>
of <i>Ripley’s Believe It or Not</i> fame.<br>
Not for the maple bars, cinnamon buns or bear claws,<br>
nor my favorite, chocolate glazed,<br>
just the palindrome reflected off the window<br>
across the street from the<br>
Yreka Bakery.<br>
Somehow when I journeyed back home<br>
I never dreamt it would be this hard<br>
to find  the places I recall.<br>
The next time <br>
I come up this way<br>
I think I’ll just use MapQuest.com.<br>
