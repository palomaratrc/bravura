by Atlas Roark</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>
<br>
=ve got nothing to lose,<br>
you=ve got nothing to give.<br>
=ll keep pulling us down,<br>
toward the holes where we live.<br>
Now try pulling us up,<br>
now life=s half-spilling your cup.<br>
Time has ways of filling it up<br>
with what=s cynically <br>
left when what=s right<br>
too much resembles what=s wrong.<br>
Do all your impressions belong to<br>
grown children in songs?<br>
Who decided to chooseB <br>
is it freedom or booze?<br>
The sun or the muse?<br>
Can you win when you lose?<br>
Can you conclude<br>
the price that you pay is seldom<br>
just enough?<br>
It=s often so much<br>
fucking rat-race-running more.<br>
Let=s settle the score,<br>
make nothing but lore,<br>
and choose chaos galore.<br>
And when avoiding a chore<br>
you can see what comes<br>
casually walking through that<br>
so elusive, and so exclusiveB<br>
this so damn reclusiveB door.<br>
Treadmills remain attached to the floor.<br>
The things that I hear,<br>
while holding metal-wrapped beer,<br>
seeing past years in the mirrors,<br>
sure make the circling laps seem<br>
to push the fogB<br>
exposing all pink, inflated hogs<br>
using people as logs<br>
to fuel their political fire.<br>
The warmth of the liar,<br>
in telephone wires,<br>
keeps himself forever<br>
responding from both ends.<br>
But feeling depends<br>
on the institute=s trends;<br>
and pallid, contrived humility.<br>
Amassing to make this<br>
tremendously-grey futility:<br>
A clean, half-feigned servility.<br>
They=ve got nothing to gain.<br>
We=ve got nothing to lose.<br>
Let=s give pleasure to pain.<br>
Come now.  It=s time that you choose.<br>
Come join in the game.<br>
Keep forgetting to blame<br>
a distorted sense of self.<br>
The phantoms are stealth,<br>
when you=re stuck on the shelf.<br>
Do they awaken the dust?<br>
Cover your instincts with trust,<br>
make sure to join us<br>
and we=ll hunt with a lust<br>
that keeps us circling round;<br>
finding things to keep down.<br>
This raging fire=s the sound,<br>
leaving our subtlety un-found<br>
as the wizard=s light leads us<br>
complacently by the hand.<br>
Subservient bands,<br>
and the system that stands<br>
can comfort a far too troubled sense<br>
of invented direction.<br>
When, like muscles, we tense<br>
the energy of the suspense<br>
climbs swiftly to fall to the floor.<br>
Implore what=s ignored.<br>
Well, how about one more?<br>
What you already think,<br>
as you=re sipping that drink,<br>
is truly the link<br>
to what=s now,<br>
and forever in ink.<br>
And when you=ve gone and finally hit the wall,<br>
and after all, there=s nothing left to do but fall, and crawlB<br>
when after all the engines have stalledB<br>
will your knees withstand the scraping?<br>
