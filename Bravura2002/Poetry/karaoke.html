  <br>
  He lives in a shabby upstairs apartment <br>
  He's so musically talented <br>
  When he forgets to take his medication <br>
  <br>
  There's this keyboard he keeps next to the window <br>
  It's hooked up to an amplifier <br>
  And when the mood strikes him <br>
  He strikes random keys and sings tunelessly <br>
  Almost like Native American chanting gone completely wrong and deranged <br>
  But worse <br>
  <br>
  Other days, he plays from various selections <br>
  Such as: <br>
  The Music of the Seventies (the songs that were better left forgotten) <br>
  Gregorian Chant (set to a techno beat) <br>
  Alternative Christmas Carols (the ones that Satan wrote) <br>
  And he moonwalks on the patio <br>
  <br>
  It wouldn't be so bad <br>
  Except this occurs at three in the morning <br>
  <br>
  The other day <br>
  He left the door to his apartment open <br>
  As he performed a striptease in front of his mirror <br>
  Lipsynching to YMCA</font></p>
