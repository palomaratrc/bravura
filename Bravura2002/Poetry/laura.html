  I should be concerned about the plight of the migrant worker, picketing somewhere 
  in the middle of rush hour, instigating Bourgeois accidents, and grabbing random 
  people by their arms and shouting at them "does the government own your future?!" 
  I should be locked in my room, conspiring different ways to infiltrate McDonald's' 
  beef supply, to single handedly heal the ozone, to personally feed all those 
  who are hungry. I should be throwing myself over the limp, furry body of a kitten 
  about to be wrongfully euthanized or pacing up and down downtown streets waiting 
  for elderly pedestrians to need help, meanwhile giving metaphoric discussions 
  about the true nature of war to high school students passing by. I should be, 
  but for some reason, I am not. For some reason I can do nothing else but sit 
  here in this capitalist haven that is my room, Indian-style and swaying to Cat 
  Stevens, staring at this picture on my wall of two squiggly lines headed toward 
  a boat. And somewhere on their horizon, little trees of ink blow color off the 
  page and urge the figures down their long, winding road as I, just behind them, 
  follow their tiny puddle footsteps down the path of white. Waiting. And as they 
  draw nearer to the boat, I pull my pant legs up to my knees and run quickly 
  ahead of them, pushing aside their joined hands, disrupting the warmth they 
  are fused by. </font>

  I <br>
  Leap <br>
  Into <br>
  <br>
  the planks painted there by some street artist in Vietnam and drift cowardly 
  off the page that I received, <br>
  second hand, <br>
  from someone<br>
  who second handed me. <br>
  And thinking to myself, I should be saving the world, but for some reason, I'm 
  too busy saving myself. </font>
