<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A New Angle <br>
Zachary Simon</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>
<br>
Courses through many times back<br>
Perpendicular compromise of <i>my</i> fake leather on <i>my</i> cheap wood<br>
throughout the shameless trickery that luckily<br>
was harmless too<br>
to anyone but me<br>
Comfort the times as they would comfort you if they could<br>
like how hard truths abandon while clinging to a hope<br>
for a kinder one…<br>
four of a kind of cruel<br>
Pictures leaned against a wall<br>
will slide onto the floor<br>
Icons in the gardens<br>
are fruit trees in the store<br>
Executioners never know the truth<br>
but they see the greatest smiles<br>
Tour guides feign interest the best<br>
as they measure their sex in miles<br>
A structure without shame<br>
Determined to stay in one piece as it falls<br>
like an old man<br>
Ironically not at all repulsed by a mistake<br>
which was a joke  <br>
on which one was it? <br>
The cruelest man cries on a woman’s shoulder as he wraps his arms around<br>
to feel his child in her belly<br>
smooth and round but<br>
a new angle embodies<br>
Snakes eat eggs with dead lewdness<br>
as friends will take for granted<br>
Did you save the master’s memory <br>
because you know he likes it slanted  <br>
A hesitant left hand can mock <br>
the call of fertile space<br>
For romance between the avenged<br>
does little to save their face<br>
And forever resurrecting<br>
the temptation to defy<br>
Flatter well the numbers<br>
the numbers never lie<br>
