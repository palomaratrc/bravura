  <br>
  As we sat and watched the cherry clossoms fall<br>
  At the start of the new year<br>
  We finally really got away from it all<br>
  And no one sheds a single tear<br>
  The warm summer wind blowing through the tall oak trees<br>
  The music of the oriental fair<br>
  Your stunning pure beauty brings me to my knees<br>
  As thesun streaks your dark silky hair<br>
  Night falls and fireworks paint the sky<br>
  Holding you close, lost in your deep kiss<br>
  Two eastern angels unviels their wings to fly<br>
  Heading to the heavens, flying to eternal bliss<br>
  As we sat and watched the cherry blossoms bloom<br>
  Memories fill our racing hearts <br>
  My love and I know that the next fair will start soon<br>
  And two eastern angels will be there when it starts<br>
