  may I share the pelican with you?<br>
  you two are, too<br>
  I’m one, but sometime I’ve been as you <br>
  a two. out here-<br>
  on a pier, to gaze upon orion, <br>
  above the pacific swells shifting <br>
  as a living skin <br>
  dark. <br>
  the sea’s surf- <br>
  ace painted bright, a <br>
  swath of sparkle  <br>
  brushed by la luna. <br>
  eye catching, as it is,  <br>
  a brush stroke through time<br>
  caught on the sea, to see.<br>
  straight along the swells-<br>
  it zigs, along the breakers,<br>
  interrupted by zags <br>
  across the whitewash breaking <br>
  the linear light rule, <br>
  as only water can.<br>
  may I share the light of shore fires with you?<br>
  blazing beacons, to ward away <br>
  a sea chilled breeze. <br>
  pyres set atop the steep shoreline<br>
  too steep for the sea to climb here- <br>
  where our world begins to end. </font><br>
