<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Preface to the Rest<br>
Brandon Tankersley</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>
<br>
my stomach acts out those rare times<br>
of heartbreak death or a sleepless thoughtful night<br>
my soul—whatever the name—weeping metaphysical tears<br>
with no outlet but a small seeping through<br>
some deep muscle tissue, unfulfilling drops<br>
onto a sheet of paper<br>
always unable to declare how much I really love you<br>
whoever you are<br>
my poems will never shine upon you<br>
hot and tangible in a gold field with moon-strung waves<br>
pushing wheat gently at the head<br>
you’ll hear the thread of a tear-<br>
full of want- in all the rest<br>
since I cannot give you the warm sun<br>
or foreign city streets, or truths most real in suffering<br>
I’ll weep for you, and laugh because you’re beautiful<br>
I’ll kiss you, and always pull away a second too soon<br>
I’ll mourn imperfect pages, sacrilege to a dreaming heart<br>
I’ll give you a moment from my life, full of value<br>
be careful not to dismiss it too soon<br>
I’m very sensitive you know<br>
