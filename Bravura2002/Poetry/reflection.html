<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">a reflection at springtime<br>
Brandon Tankersley</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>
<br>
what reasons have I to grudge the twilit Muse<br>
images of rain and river moonbeam shielding them from adolescent pain<br>
is it because I find wrinkles so very unsettling<br>
or do the shoe-strings of nature pull us sensitive men<br>
into an ever widening well that is invisible a meter ahead<br>
and does time settle the monkey that is always driving me mad<br>
does the ability to sniff cinnamon steadily increase<br>
and do genitals morph into blue cotton candy<br>
and what is that secret hanging overhead in nectar popping droplets<br>
oozing hallucinogens piped to our fancy<br>
sculpting a soft lipped smile through the day <br>
and would a time warp synthesize these warring factions<br>
or (I suspect) it’s all here now pushing through the earth<br>
sprouting butterflies seasons hence<br>
warming us closer to the dirt<br>
