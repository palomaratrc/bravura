  of Conviction<br>
  James H. Miller</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>
  <br>
  The stones of my conviction I carry home from the beach,<br>
  where I had gone to ask the water what to do <br>
  Smooth white stones, some quite murky while others nearly transparent,<br>
  like the shades of clarity in my decision.<br>
  Along the way I passed a fountain,<br>
  speaking in trickles, reminding me,<br>
  silly: the best choice is the one bringing the most peace,<br>
  as that is what a decision does best.<br>
  When I asked the waves the same question,<br>
  they said the fountain already told me.<br>
  Then the receding tide drew thousands of smooth white stones toward the sea,<br>
  knocking into each other, laughing the laugh of thousands at my petty dilema.<br>
  So I carry some stones with me home from the beach,<br>
  letting their smooth white voices reminds me of all the water had said,<br>
  and the right thing to do.</font>
