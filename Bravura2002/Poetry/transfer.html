  Jon Aretakis</font></p>
<p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are no accidents, 
  just a whole bunch of misunderstandings.</font></p>
<p><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They named her after a song<br>
  She traded her bright red hatchback<br>
  For a white Volvo<br>
  She wears white-framed sunglasses<br>
  And bell-bottoms<br>
  She can't help but look at her reflection<br>
  As she passes the freezer glass doors<br>
  She waddles around<br>
  Like a slender penguin<br>
  While her butt<br>
  Seems to hang off the back of her hips<br>
  Like soft smooth<br>
  Hamburger buns<br>
  She wears her hair up<br>
  I saw it fall<br>
  Unraveling<br>
  Pretty<br>
  But hurting<br>
  An insatiable desire to be honest<br>
  Rarely used<br>
  Pain scorned<br>
  Keeping<br>
  Herself imaginatively unaware<br>
  She likes the grass<br>
  Cigarettes and Ethanol<br>
  Pure Anxiety<br>
  Storming<br>
  Self-Conscious<br>
  Of her breasts<br>
  Untrusting of men<br>
  I gave her my therapist's phone number<br>
  Because she would not give me hers<br>
  She will never call<br>
  She will arrange one boob job<br>
  To find<br>
  Something missing<br>
  Deepening<br>
  The Removal of her mask<br>
  Instead<br>
  Chasing her images<br>
  She searches for a safe bar<br>
  She will never find<br>
  She searches the world<br>
  For something covered<br>
  Twisted and Knotted<br>
  Inside her own mind<br>
  She transferred in<br>
  And casually dropped my heart into the meat grinder<br>
  Circling<br>
  She travels around herself<br>
  I hope, one day, she discovers her true center</font></p>
