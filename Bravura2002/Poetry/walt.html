Walt Whitman<br>
why do I hurt inside <br>
when I read one of your lines?<br>
my finger turns on your weathered and bearded face<br>
and I say –would you approve my friendship<br>
if we had met on some appointed days?<br>
I fear that I’m not enough of a homosexual for you<br>
though you (and I) may hate that name<br>
and I’ve never once worked a man sized job–<br>
shoveling coal– till the close of day<br>
I’ve never slept in a hard bed.<br>
(do I here mimic a worthier companion?<br>
and why should not two voices be allowed to reach you?)<br>
Mr. Whitman, would our science have ruined you?<br>
and what song will you sing today to the men<br>
who captain the ship inherited from you?<br>
and do you embrace souls who have forgotten they must cry?<br>
who have traded earthly consecration<br>
for a slight hum<br>
coming from a box which puppets their lives?<br>
if you’ll allow another question<br>
a little shaming–and shameful that I’d be so shamed–<br>
were you ever really so alone<br>
(I thought I’d heard it in your voice)<br>
and did you come to accept<br>
that <i>personne</i> would reach out and take the hand<br>
you offer freely<br>
and did you sit night after night in your chair replacing it with your own?<br>
and here, sir, I wonder if we shall ever meet<br>
though you will always nourish the best parts of me<br>
I wander too, but sadly cannot keep your pace<br>
and if I had somehow hitched onto your eloping fop<br>
I think I might have turned some unlucky morning<br>
and cut your sexy hair while you sleep.<br>
