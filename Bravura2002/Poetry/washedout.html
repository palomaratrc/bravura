  Robynne Mugar<br>
  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>
  Nervous...apprehensive<br>
  Something just felt wrong<br>
  Sitting shotgun and spinning<br>
  I was afraid of what was to come.<br>
  The florescent lights piercing,<br>
  watched the gas gage rise up.<br>
  Fumbling fingers frantically nubbed the fuzzy floor<br>
  Wallet washed out.<br>
  A small hyper package<br>
  housed a flattened sphere of no color<br>
  Lost in one gulp, was sickening-<br>
  Not to mention what was said...<br>
  A dull and throbbing pain<br>
  Loss of breath. You must have held me in line.<br>
  A black box of black souls<br>
  Shammed by bouncing rays of light.<br>
  Hot sweaty skin smeared with neon tattoos Neon straws fallen from hollow glasses<br>
  Empty, bringing emptiness<br>
  Disoriented, distorted, confused.<br>
  At times all I wanted was to find you<br>
  Until I couldn't bear it<br>
  The music shook me from the inside out<br>
  Crumbling my senses<br>
  Thumping and shrieking,<br>
  (My heart was breaking)<br>
  And all the while I could never catch your eyes<br>
  So I gave in, gave up, and was conquered <br>
  In now what I remember only as a dark, muted haze.<br>
