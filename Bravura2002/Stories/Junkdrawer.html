  Drawer Mysteries<br>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>Hold on 
  to your heinies because the universe as we know it has been ripped asunder!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>I found 
  my husband the other day cleaning out the Kitchen Junk Drawer. All of my treasures, 
  big and small, were being tossed into the garbage along with the coffee grounds 
  and leftover scrambled eggs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“What 
  are you doing!”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“I’m cleaning 
  out this drawer. It’s so full of crap it doesn’t even close properly. Look!” 
  He held out his bandaged pinky. “I cut the hell out of my finger on something 
  in there! I’m amazed I didn’t rip the whole thing off!” </font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     
  </span>“So? Do you know how many fingernails I’ve broken? You can’t mess around 
  the with Junk Drawer.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“What?!?” 
  he said, “It’s just junk! I don’t even know why we even keep half of this stuff…..”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“You have 
  no idea of what you have done. The Kitchen Junk Drawer is sacrosanct, never 
  to be touched, cleaned out or organized. Didn’t your mother teach you anything? 
  Everything in there is in there for a reason.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“A reason? 
  Explain to me the reason you kept all these garbage bag twistees when you tie 
  up the bags by the handles?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“Those 
  twistee thingies came in handy last winter when we hung out those seed bells 
  for the birds.”   </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>“Okay…okay…how 
  about these buttons? There are a dozen buttons in here. None of them even match!”</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“Maybe 
  one day I’ll find the shirt they go to. Or maybe one day I’ll need to make a 
  sock puppet. Or maybe one day I could incorporate them all into a wonderful 
  heirloom quilt…”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“Since 
  when did you start quilting?”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“I might….someday….”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“So, let 
  me see if I have this right: in case there is a shortage of bird seed bell hangers, 
  or if are drafted into a sock puppet brigade or, most unlikely, you are overwhelmed 
  by a compulsive desire to document our family in a quilt of buttons, we have 
  to put up with this drawer full of junk?”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>I closed 
  the Drawer, took him by the hand and led him to the kitchen table. It is another 
  sacred place in our house. It is where the kids and I worry over homework, paint 
  with watercolors and play with clay. It is also the place where my husband and 
  I can spend a few moments together just talking, checking in with on another. 
  Since we had children, any time spent together is relished. It is interesting 
  to note that we are usually brought together with the promise of food. The table 
  is a wonderful place, a warm and secure focus of our home.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>“You 
  moron.” I said, sitting down. “You just don’t get it, do you? The stuff in the 
  Kitchen Junk Drawer is not just junk…it’s a whole box of possibilities.”</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>. “One 
  person’s possibilities are another person’s fire hazard.” he said, crossing 
  his legs. <br>
  ”And I am not a moron.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“You just 
  don’t understand the quantum physics of probabilities.” I said in a huff.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“What?!?”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“See, 
  I have this theory…”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“Oh, Lord…..she 
  has a theory…”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>I feel 
  I need to explain something, my husband is a Master Sergeant in the Marine Corps. 
  He has always been a see-the-hill, take-the-hill kind of guy. He flunked out 
  of philosophy because he could never wrap his mind around the idea that a table 
  is a table only because you <b><i>think</i></b> it is a table.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“No.” 
  he would reply, “It is a table because it <b><i>is</i></b> a table. See? Wooden 
  legs, flat surface on top. Table!”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>God love 
  him; he keeps me grounded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“It’s 
  like the problem of Schrodinger’s cat.” I  could see his eyes dimming.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>“Where 
  you put a cat in a box with a vial of poison with the probability that the poison 
  will be released and kill the kitty but, conversely, there exists the probability 
  that the poison won’t be released and the kitty will live. So, until the moment 
  that the box is opened, the kitty is both alive and dead. See?”</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“Speaking 
  of which…..I haven’t seen the cat in days….”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>I smacked 
  him up side his head. “ Look, we need the Kitchen Junk Drawer to keep balance. 
  With it, we always have the possibility of finding what we need. Need a rubber 
  band? Try the Kitchen Junk Drawer. Lost a key? Look in the Kitchen Junk Drawer. 
  Do you understand? Within the Drawer lie possibilities.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“And so 
  my organizing it-“</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“Completely 
  destroys the purpose!” We can’t ever know exactly what is in the Kitchen Junk 
  Drawer or what we need won’t be there!”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“ So, 
  you are saying that things just magically appear in there. That there are things 
  in that drawer, that drawer right over there, that we did not put in there ourselves? 
  That some sort of invisible cosmic power uses our drawer has a dumping ground?”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“No, not 
  really. More like a magnet.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“A magnet? 
  To pull in junk?”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“To pull 
  in what we need. When we need it.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“You, 
  my love,” he said, kissing my forehead, “are nuts. And I am going to clean out 
  this drawer.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span> “Didn’t 
  you listen to a word I said?!?!?” I said, trying to stop him from pulling out 
  the drawer. “Who knows what will happen!”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“I know 
  exactly what will happen. I’ll stop cutting my fingers to ribbons looking for 
  the Pizza Hut flyer!”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“You’re 
  just like a man! No regard for something you can’t touch, kick or eat!”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>“Consider 
  yourself liberated, my love, cause this stuff is going!” </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>And so 
  it did. Crinkled bits of ribbons, buttons, bent paper clips, cord, strings, 
  rubber bands, a torn piece of paper with a forgotten phone number on it, a few 
  rhinestones, shells from the beach, pens, a small red ball, some marbles, expired 
  packets of ketchup and taco sauce, some broken scissors (“So that’s what bit 
  me!”), pizza flyers, Chinese take-out menus, glue, tape, glitter. All of it. 
  Into the trash. With what he decided to keep, the current pizza take-out menu, 
  some working pens, a few rubber bands, some paper and the phone directory, he 
  placed in the drawer with precise neatness. I don’t know why I didn’t see this 
  coming sooner. He always does this when he comes back from the field; he needs 
  to organize some part of the house in order to feel like a working part of the 
  family. See? He can say to himself, I did this. I am a part of this household, 
  not just a fleeting shadow. It is his way of marking his territory. I should 
  be happy. There are worse ways.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>Still 
  I worried. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>     </span>Days passed. 
  Every working ink pen, pencil, crayon and marker in the house disappeared. There 
  wasn’t a rubber band, safety pin or twistee to be found in the house. It was 
  as if something had gone into reverse and was sucking anything put into it <i>out 
  of it.</i> Kind of like the mystery surrounding missing socks and the dyer. 
  The latest probe to Mars disappeared. I’m not saying that the emptying of the 
  Kitchen Junk Drawer had anything to do with it but it is an interesting proposition. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>Still 
  I have faith; the Universe has a way of balancing what Man comes along and bumbles 
  out of whack. So when, the other day, my son fell down and needed a Band-Aid 
  and the box in the medicine cabinet was empty. I glanced nervously towards the 
  kitchen and, holding my breath, I looked into the Kitchen Junk Drawer.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>And, 
  lo, there was one solitary Band-Aid.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>I 
  could breathe again.</span></font></p>
