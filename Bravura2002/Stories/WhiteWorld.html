World<br>
A monologue by crystal sorensen</font></span> </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Setting:             The 
  wake before a clear crowned casket.  A young woman, early 20’s, stands in shock 
  before blonde Snow White that has been her best friend for ten years.  She attempts 
  to maintain composure.  The intimacy is harrowing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span>“I 
  found a piece of your hair in my toothbrush last night.  I didn’t know what 
  do to with it.  Eventually I found the nerve to flush it down the toilet.  Some 
  mornings when I cannot breathe in the perfectly still air, I feel you lurking 
  somewhere in the dawn’s early light.  I hear these lonely whimpers in the distance, 
  and I can barely hear you say that you are clean…again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span>There 
  are these remnants of your lingering everywhere.  In every word, every song, 
  every poem I write.  How is that fair, that you just leave and I’m still here 
  without redemption or reasons or my fucking favorite red jacket that you borrowed 
  last week?…Bitch.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span>Well, 
  here we are in this moment of all the plaguing nightmares, that I thought had 
  safely died.  You lying in that iron bed…and I am so cold.  Why do you get to 
  hide in there, obscured and safe?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span>How 
  perfect still, you look, that Angel face and pure blonde hair…those great eyes.  
  I’m so sorry that your eyes had to see what they did.  And now I am here with 
  what’s left, a cold, pale, lank body.  Well you aren’t fooling me; I know who 
  you are inside…and I love you so much.  Why couldn’t you understand that, that 
  I would always love you no matter what was reflected in your eyes or what your 
  body endured, and not just because you were radiant, but because without me 
  you were only half, and without you my life is not so beautifully lived. You 
  were the Angel of my life, the halo over my head.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span>You 
  probably don’t even remember that.  How could you as numbly rode the heroic 
  white horse right by me, in search of tarnished needles and couches to nod off 
  on?  And you always came back, but I had to give up holding you, because I always 
  held you and you never got better.  Like that day on the porch when you stretched 
  the punctured underbelly of your arm across my lap and asked me what to do, 
  like I had a say in it all.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span>If 
  only I could have stopped you that last time, if just for once my prayers were 
  the Heroine.  And that last time…plays over and over in my mind, like the ghost 
  of a pedestrian that has shattered against my windshield.  I’ll never forget 
  the look in your eyes, when I walked into your room, as you were plunging that 
  needle into your big blue vein.  And all those worthless pieces of shit just 
  sat there, while I tied to make you stop shaking.  God, you were so disgusting 
  and scary and you said to me, “You are all that I still love.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span>What 
  the fuck is that supposed to mean?  That I wasn’t enough?  And I don’t care 
  if nobody ever triumphs over the heroine, I was supposed to...<i>we </i>were 
  supposed to.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span>That 
  night I slept, my pillow drenched in spit and snot, and I dreamed about you 
  and me holding my hands. We were dressed in all white, like heavenly cherubs. 
  You reached for my hand as if you knew the way, no struggle…just big smiles.  
  Just like when we were ten and used to say “Don’t Die,” instead of good-bye 
  because we read it was cool on <i>Seventeen</i>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span>And 
  when we finally reached the light, I couldn’t remember anything that had happened. 
  We played hide-and-seek in these bushes that looked like the ones in your front 
  yard. Only then I couldn’t find you. I sat down and cried on the curb. Then 
  I heard your angelic voice saying “I’m sorry for hurting you…I love you so much.. 
  Don’t Die.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">I woke up knowing that that 
  was the end of your pain, I suppose some souls just aren’t made for this place 
  for very long. These are the times when I feel you just aren’t made for this 
  place very long.  These are these times when I feel you pulsating inside my 
  chest.  Dennis thinks I’m crazy, but I can’t help feeling this big hole…this 
  absolute emptiness, like someone has stabbed me right in the heart with a huge 
  needle. I keep thinking that one day I’ll find the path that makes me to that 
  place where we can be best friends again, in a white world.</font></p>
