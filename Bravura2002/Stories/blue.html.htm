<h5><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b><font size="2">Frank 
  &amp; Molly </font></b></font></h5>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">It 
  was Blue.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">To 
  say it was blue, to Neil, would have been an understatement.  It was, without 
  a doubt, the most wonderful color blue he had ever seen in his entire life.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">After 
  catching his breath, and, with a panicked pound of his chest, Neil slammed on 
  his brakes and pulled to the side of the road.  He placed his car's corrugated 
  cardboard windshield-cover in place (It read &quot;Need Help: Please Call Police,&quot; 
  ensuring that no one would stop at the side of the road to disturb him).  Neil 
  then climbed out and stared in awe at the sight before him.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“My 
  God.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In 
  that moment Neil forgot everything.  His name, his job, his two roommates Molly 
  and Frank, two totally opposite personalities who, through the grace of what 
  some people would call God, met through Neil and immediately fell in one-sided 
  fascination. </font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Frank 
  had been hired by a major networking company to reduce their bandwidth by downloading 
  digital music by Bad Religion, and writing quotes by Mahatma Ghandi on the whiteboard 
  they provided him.  He enjoyed every minute of his job, and could not understand 
  why so many people complained about theirs.  When he decided he was no longer 
  needed, he left and waited on a bench outside the San Diego apartment rented 
  by Neil, Molly and himself. </font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Every 
  day Frank would sit on the same bench, and wait. It didn’t matter for what.  
  And he stared. It didn’t matter at what. The sky worked.  Or a person, leaf, 
  slab of concrete.  He sought to glean no new information, as he had just enough 
  trouble as it was, recognizing the distinction between objects that were not 
  himself.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Frank 
  was large, with the fuzz of what had been a shaved head, and quite ugly.  Frank 
  was Life, not at all arrogant but completely egocentric.  “Life is a wonderful, 
  beautiful thing,” he said about himself. When Frank finished staring and waiting, 
  the the floodgates opened and Philosophy flowed forth.  Though Frank lacked 
  the drive to come up with much of his own, he could very well appreciate it 
  all, and was quite content to ponder his own three-word philosophy: “Life is 
  Weird.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">On 
  one particular day Frank had a friend – a long-lasting friendship of six months 
  – waiting for a ride.  Her car in the shop, she would continue waiting outside 
  her office building, without a way home.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Molly 
  was the absolute essence of a young businesswoman – short and thin with shoulder-length 
  wavy brown hair covering the shoulders of her red sweater-jacket, and a throbbing 
  pain in her arm where propping herself up on the grass had irritated her developing 
  carpal tunnel syndrome.  Acceptable losses in her struggle to climb the corporate 
  ladder in record time.  What hurt far worse was the fact that she had lots of 
  time here and less to do in it.  She had been trained from birth to be busy, 
  and while her intelligence surpassed Frank’s, she considered herself too practical 
  to be stuck here existing, doing all the nothing she had to do. Her high school 
  GPA was 4.3, college was turning on her with a disgraceful 3.9, and now she 
  was bored as hell. To make matters worse, Frank’s waiting had increased her 
  own waiting tenfold.  Why was she being made to wait here?  What did she look 
  like, a waiter? </font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Waitress,” 
  the Molly in her mind corrected her.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Same 
  thing,” the Frank in her mind corrected her.  The whole process of self-correction 
  took less time than it took to think all three words at once.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Great… 
  now she was starting to think.  She hated when that happened, not because she 
  was bad at it, but because Thinking replaced Action, which everyone knows is 
  far superior.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Molly 
  was just one more person with whom Frank could be intrigued.  In truth, Frank 
  was intrigued with everyone, but that feeling grew with those more distinctly 
  different from himself – and to Frank, Neil and Molly were perfect specimens.  
  While Frank believed in the goodness and beauty of human nature, and life, and 
  the world, and everything, Molly believed, when she believed at all, in total 
  neutrality of the human spirit, that neither good or evil could live within 
  one person at once, Tabula Rasa<i>,</i> or not, whatever, I’ve got better things 
  to do.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Neil believed 
  in nothing, and justified his world view with an essay he saw written on that 
  last bastion of philosophical thought, the back of a Tool Album.  “Beliefs are 
  Dangerous. Beliefs allow a functional mind to stop functioning, a non-functioning 
  mind is clinically dead. Believe in nothing.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Yeah!” 
  was his response.  Neil used this snippet ‘o’ wisdom to remind him why he should 
  not believe in anything, to compensate for his unintentionally cynical attitude 
  and uncooperative brain which reminded him that he <i>could</i> not believe 
  in anything.  Religion was a joke, science <i>depended </i>upon disbelief, and 
  the thought of humanity raised his blood pressure by twenty points.  Neil’s 
  job took him to meet all the different people he could stand, talk to them for 
  thirty seconds, and leave, which of course interested Frank as a possible side-job.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“The 
  problem is, though…” Neil didn’t say to Frank, “Most of those new people I could 
  do without.” And, in his own mind, he was right. He delivered pizza to put himself 
  through school, and in any given day met ten to twelve people surrounded by 
  beige and orange who had paid five-hundred-thousand dollars to live in half-a-million 
  dollar homes so that they could share the suburban experience with neighbors 
  they hated.  Beige and Orange, everything.  The suburban experience was an old, 
  decayed filmstrip shot by his mortal enemies, the housing developers.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">If 
  he had actually said this to Frank, though, Frank would have responded to the 
  tune of: “And I want to meet every single one of them.”  And he did, because 
  it was Frank’s own belief that if he had a nice, shallow encounter with every 
  human on Earth, he would finally fully understand them all.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Neil’s 
  feelings about his customers came to him two-fold: First, they were horrid tippers. 
  Cathedral-style ceilings, a beautifully-architectured waste of space, huge earth-toned 
  wooden doors, to let everyone know how welcome, as well as absolutely insignificant 
  they were, and other wonderfully expensive Southern-Californian eye candy apparently 
  left little room for the two-fifty it took to make someone’s day better.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
  second, more indirect source of his feelings was his post-analysis on each person 
  he met, lumped into a daily summary: “In general,” he reasoned after a series 
  of superficial thirty-second transactions, “I am the only person in this state 
  deeper than a kiddie-pool.” He reasoned later that he was probably wrong, but 
  how could he tell? Neil spent all day speaking with people who believed speedy 
  pizza delivery was a constitutional right.  He had seen entire cities built 
  in five years.  Ten years ago his highways had never known the meaning of “rush 
  hour.”  His brushy mountain landscape, that he fell in love with when he moved 
  to San Diego, had turned beige and orange.  Beige and Orange, everything.  His 
  world had changed, something that made the twenty-four-year-old feel eighty.  
  He had a right to be cynical, angry with these people who had each paid half 
  a million dollars to take away his city.</font></p>
<h2 style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>God</b></font></h2>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Neil 
  now ascended the billboard at the side of the road with the speed and power 
  usually associated with those placed in life-or-death situations.  As he climbed, 
  the misty, pale gray sky waned into the overwhelming Blue.  He moved his hand 
  in a vague motion similar to that of petting a giant cat.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Oh 
  . . . &quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">It 
  had a painter’s ledge to stand on.  Good.  He stood on the ledge and didn't 
  fall backwards.  It was an omen.  Neil sat down to conserve the energy it would 
  take for his brain to accept what he had seen. At least he thought he sat down.  
  He couldn’t be quite sure, and it no longer mattered to him anyway; he had seen 
  the Blue. </font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Neil 
  analyzed the Blue.  It was dark… but not too dark.  This Blue was something 
  he could drink; something with the word “electric” attached to it, or some kind 
  of genetically engineered fruit punch.  He had seen close relatives of this 
  blue, but this...?  They had thrown a tiny, minuscule bit of red in there to 
  thwart the close examiner.  It was almost purple, but not quite.  Ah ha! thought 
  Neil.  &quot;I'm smarter than that.&quot; he said out loud, to whoever was listening.  
  &quot;It's NOT purple! It's Blue. …And… and don't you try to tell me otherwise.&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">At 
  that moment there was only Blue. With the world put on hold, Neil could stare 
  into the beauty of a single color, a color so perfect that he felt even more 
  insignificant than before.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Neil 
  wanted desperately to congratulate whoever had created such a fine shade of 
  paint, until it struck him that this could not have been created by any man. 
  It was Perfect. It was the Stuff of Legends. It was whatever the Gods of Olympus 
  would have dressed in, it was It.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">He knew that.  
  Why was he thinking it?  A relentless thinker, Neil’s first reaction was to 
  come up with thousands of answers and the questions such as these that they 
  connected with in seconds.  He had done this all his life, and it was time to 
  stop.  He had to concentrate on The Blue.  &quot;Stupid letters.&quot; he mumbled 
  at the white letters, intruding like hecklers into The Blue's show. The huge 
  ‘Q’ was particularly offensive. &quot;Of all the letters... ‘Q’ has done us 
  the least good. And now it has the nerve to intrude on The Blue.&quot;  It was 
  a problem far more pressing than the everyday life he chose to tear apart, and 
  the hordes of people with whom he had endless issues.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Am 
  I the only one who is depressed by this?&quot; Neil had asked Frank on a trip 
  to the grocery store. “This” was a TV dinner. </font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Pff... 
  Hahah...&quot; Frank's smile hung incredulously. &quot;If you find one more 
  reason to be depressed, you'll hold the record or something.&quot; </font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Frank 
  had to be stopped before he unleashed song lyrics at him.  Frank had a database 
  of “inspirational” song lyrics at-a-glance.  &quot;No, it's not the TV dinner... 
  But, like, I don't like these things anyway, it's this thing on the back. You 
  work hard to provide a good, honest meal for your family, so trust yaddah yaddah 
  bring you da da da new choices et cetera-Am I the only one who finds this depressing? 
  It's intangible, sort of.&quot; Frank nodded slightly, admitting that Neil was 
  not the only one who felt the fibers of time-space strain a little from that 
  simple statement.  He dismissed it quickly.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Seriously, 
  you’ve got to be the most depressed friend I have.”  Frank had many, many friends.  
  Frank’s charisma outweighed that of any other people he knew.  To most onlookers 
  that number of people ranked in the thousands, and to Frank it ranked in the 
  ones- Himself.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“I’m 
  not depressed!”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Bitter, 
  then.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“But, 
  uh… what would I have to be bitter about?”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“You 
  spent all of today asking me which depressed fictional character you were the 
  most like.  I don’t know.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“I 
  didn’t think you were listening,” retorted Neil.<br>
                  “I wasn’t,” he admitted indifferently.  Frank never listened.  
  Frank absorbed through his waiting and made assumptions based on his experience 
  with similar song lyrics.  And Frank’s trouble (though he would have, and often 
  had, called it fascination) with the concept of “other people” led him to seek 
  out Neil’s counsel on dilemmas such as the time he asked whether he should ask 
  out the recent ex-girlfriend of one of his best friends.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“No!”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“But 
  see… that’s what I wonder?  Why?” asked Frank?  </font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“You 
  just don’t!” Neil was short of breath.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“<i>You</i> 
  just don’t.  And I’m trying to find out why,” and then Frank betrayed his true 
  purpose, “because you think so differently from me.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Neil 
  knew him far too well, and Frank had proven himself again.  “You’re going to 
  do it no matter what, aren’t you?”</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“My friend 
  said he didn’t mind.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Of 
  course he said that!”  The breath Neil had worked so hard to regain disappeared 
  again.  He knew if he got into that subject, all he would accomplish would have 
  been to lay his own soul bare, something he had not the energy to do at the 
  time.  He decided instead at the next opportunity to ask him about some song 
  lyrics.  </font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Neil 
  honestly did not blame him for his flakiness, and often believed it to be the 
  source of what could loosely be defined as his “charm”.  Frank’s way of life 
  had stemmed from a conundrum Neil called The Problem of the SUV – one so twisted 
  and immense he could only symbolize it.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">One 
  morning Neil woke up and found he was driving to his college; the first things 
  he saw were the giant letters “L A N D C R U I S E R” underneath the familiar 
  bull insignia of the Toyota motors corporation.  His groggy first-morning logic 
  was able to think much more clearly and directly than his midday logic, so his 
  mind immediately shot to an old C.M. Kornbluth story he had read.  In the future, 
  the story said, children raise themselves because both parents have to work 
  to afford giant houses and giant vehicles called “Land Cruisers,” which get 
  about five miles to the gallon and can only be driven on special roads with 
  gas stations placed strategically and frequently alongside them.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“A 
  fad,” he once rambled to Molly.  “A hulking monstrosity, brand new for the price 
  of two Camaros.”  The studious CEO-in-training would have responded with something 
  about the practicality, usefulness… economy? something? of a good SUV.  Had 
  she believed it.  But, considering it, she stopped herself. “They probably pay 
  extra,” Neil continued, “to keep me from being able to back out of parking spaces… 
  And blocking traffic … I love it, I… Ugh. I don’t know…”  He trailed off here, 
  giving up talking to Molly, who needed everything explained in terms of facts 
  when only scattered half-sentences could properly get the point across.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Neil 
  regarded the SUV as a symbol of all that was wrong in the world, self-importance, 
  excessiveness, organized religion.  He hadn’t quite figured out how the latter 
  fit in with that symbol, but if he analyzed it long enough, he knew he would 
  come upon it eventually.  Neil attempted on a regular basis to speak to God, 
  though not through that whole prayer hype. Generally, these attempts began with 
  his trying to ascertain the nature of a supreme being, continued with his yelling 
  at God for causing humans, and ending with the realization of yet another contradiction 
  in the dogma of most major religions he was familiar with.  He was familiar 
  with only one, though he kept his mind open to all the nonsense anyone was willing 
  to throw at him in the hopes that he would find the secret to the blind belief 
  he so envied.  Neil’s feelings on organized religion were Nietzschian to say 
  the least, the inevitable backfire of the religious upbringing others had had.  
  Neil heard enough of their horror stories to last a lifetime.  Molly and Frank 
  were not among them; their suburban experience manifested itself in a number 
  of other ways.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Molly 
  and Frank’s families had each been the perfect San Diegan image – Norman Rockwell 
  meets Salvador Dali, as described by Woody Allen at 60 RPM.  In high school, 
  Molly went straight from orchestra practice at four to Tae Kwon Do, which ended 
  just in time for piano lessons at eight. After that came homework, two hours 
  to do a perfect job on a ten-minute assignment, after which came thinking time, 
  which occupied the eighty-five seconds between when her head hit the pillow 
  and when she seized the opportunity to dart away from consciousness. Frank, 
  coincidentally, had been a part of that same orchestra, and his daily schedule 
  was a photocopy of Molly’s, except with lacrosse instead of Tae Kwon Do.  To 
  Neil, who had few obligations at any given time, it seemed both had come out 
  of their familial bliss with numerous battle scars. The one difference between 
  the two families was that Frank’s family had once made a passing reference to 
  something called an option, an idea which spread throughout his soul and caused 
  him to experience two separate nervous breakdowns by age nineteen, a fact he 
  often put to use in explaining why he loved all of his friends and humanity 
  so very, very much.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“I 
  love all of my friends and humanity so very, very much,” he confessed one night 
  when the three had made a late night food run.  He confessed the same thing 
  the week before, and would do so again the following week.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Well, 
  good.”  Replied Molly nonchalantly.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“I 
  should be far along the road but I’m not… ” Frank started to chant.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Okay, 
  stop, now.”  She had already reminded them how little time she had to be wasting 
  it here, and was growing impatient.  “You’re looking for the hidden meaning 
  in Techno lyrics, now.”  </font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Frank’s 
  mood changed for the worse and he felt the closest thing he could to chagrin, 
  and Neil’s chanting “everyone on the dance floor now baby” did not help the 
  situation.  Molly laughed then – she was not without a sense of humor, as long 
  as the joke was packaged well and easy to open.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Neil 
  didn’t need to spend his whole life with his roommates, in fact he hadn’t known 
  them more than about five years.  Neil saw them in every house he visited.  
  Sure, they ranged ages five through fifty and they looked different, but each 
  was a stage in the development of a “fully functional member of society.”  In 
  watching the biographies of his roommates unfold in flashback form before his 
  eyes, Neil had one less reason to believe in human nature. Any species that 
  could produce Frank was surely on the road to ruin.  Having discounted the physical 
  and the mental, the ethereal and his Fellow Man, there was little that had yet 
  to be placed in his soul’s ashtray of defeat.</font></p>
<h2 style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Irvine</b></font></h2>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Neil 
  felt a plink of soft cold on his head. He looked up and felt one in his eye. 
  </font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Whoa!&quot; 
  Had he not noticed that he really had sat down in the first place, Neil would 
  have panicked over his inevitable fall from the billboard. &quot;Thank God.&quot; 
  He kissed The Blue and then apologized for adulterating it with his human lips. 
  &quot;I'm no better than … that letter.&quot; He reasoned that if he didn't 
  refer to it indirectly, instead of saying ‘Q,’ The Blue may send negative energies 
  into his life.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">No, 
  it would never do that. Blue was a benevolent color. Not bitter and vengeful 
  like Maroon, or cold and indifferent like Beige and Orange. Better safe than 
  sorry, though.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Neil 
  looked up at the hazy sky which had presented him with these two plinks of cold. 
  &quot;Pathetic attempt, Non-Blue!!&quot; he screamed at it.  As if in retaliation, 
  the sky dropped down several more plinks. Neil concentrated deeply in the hopes 
  that the Blue would take his mind off the rain, which it did. </font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">After 
  fifteen minutes, Neil decided that he had obtained everything his feeble mind 
  could grasp from this miraculous billboard.  He looked up at the sky, whose 
  shame had obviously caused it to replace its inferior blue with a reddish gold.  
  &quot;Wow, that was not fifteen minutes.  Either I have been here for hours, 
  or ... the Blue...&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">He 
  looked down in the direction of the ground below, but before his eyes could 
  hit the ground, they hit several dozen spectators, a trampoline and two cop 
  cars.  “Whatever problems you are experiencing can be fixed!”  Neil thought 
  he heard. </font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Huh? 
  Oh. Yeah, I know.&quot; Neil felt a sudden pang of guilt for unwittingly striking 
  the sympathies of a city.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;You... 
  know?&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Hmm... 
  Yep,&quot; said Neil. &quot;Pretty sure, yeah. Listen, could I maybe get down 
  from here?&quot; He could.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Neil 
  walked to his car, cutting through the crowd of people.  He stopped to look

<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Must 
  have been a slow news day,&quot; said Neil.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;I'm 
  serious!  I mean, geez man, you coulda been dead for all I know.&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Meh.  
  Molly, since when did you get all, you know… whatever this is? The article says 
  I wasn't actually trying to commit suicide. I got off with some kind of warning 
  about climbing billboards, or … something… hey, we don't have any blue food 
  in here, do we?&quot; said Neil. He opened the cabinet. &quot;Kool-Aid.&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Molly’s 
  eyebrows contorted.  &quot;We, er, don’t really have any food in here at all. 
  You know? … I… I wasn't really trying to commit suicide, where's the blue food? 
  Pheh. I have a class now. Nutjob.&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Seeya.&quot;</font></p>

<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Neil's 
  twisted and disfigured face pulled away from the water cooler and regained its 
  shape as the body it controlled stood upright. &quot;They try, I have to give 
  them that. They try.&quot; Neil looked around. &quot;Hey, Irvine.&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Neil,&quot; 
  said his tall, lanky co-worker.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;How 
  long have we been here today?&quot; came Neil's monotone inquiry.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Thirty 
  minutes, Neil,&quot; said Irvine.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;And 
  ten something hours to go, hm? Damn Saturday mornings, not even gonna make any 
  money for six hours…&quot; said Neil.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;So 
  this boredom thing is new to you?&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Hah.&quot; 
  Neil grabbed a few highlighter markers and tapped a rhythm on the metal table 
  in front of him.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Well,&quot; 
  said Irvine, &quot;if you're, uh, ready to pick things up around here, there's 
  always the possibility of work. If you're that bored, you can, like, cut those 
  peppers.&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Those 
  peppers never did a bit of good for me. You have to wonder how much they really 
  matter.&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;They 
  don’t matter at all,&quot; admitted an indifferent Irvine. He continued, as 
  if reading off of a list: &quot;They’re someone's excuse to buy us every day 
  by providing us with menial work to keep us in line in return for the ability 
  to live, even though we never reclaim that bit of ourselves that makes us want 
  to live in the first place.  Is that what you wanted to hear?  I just thought 
  that up.  Woo.  Now get the knife.  We need peppers.&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Neil 
  applauded and searched for the peppers. “Peppers,” he went over in his head. 
  “There're no peppers here... I probably thought it was a box of paper and put 
  it in the office... on this computer. The peppers are probably in Solitaire. 
  Yup, they’re definitely in Solitaire.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">It 
  was then that the computer decided to error, resulting in that well-known bright 
  blue error-message screen. Rather than frustration, Neil felt only hope. Immediately 
  he began fine-tuning turning the tint and contrast knobs on the monitor.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Boy, 
  you've sure been working hard! It's like you've found a whole new breath of 
  energy, like the runner's high of pizza... Oh, I'm sorry, you're just sitting 
  there on the office computer staring at the Blue Screen of Death,&quot; is what 
  Irvine would have liked to say had Neil not snapped at him to shut up halfway 
  through the word &quot;been.&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;I'm 
  ... that .... close.&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Yes, 
  you are that close. Almost past, I'd say.&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Would 
  you please?&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Yeah, 
  sure...&quot; Irvine trailed off, realizing that he would just get another negative 
  response from Neil. </font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Neil 
  was nuts.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Irvine 
  proceeded to mind his own business but a voice from behind stopped him and turned 
  him around. &quot;Irvine.&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;What?&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“I’ve 
  gotta tell you something, man.  I think my life has just gotten so much meaning 
  that I can't see the meaning in the meaning.&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Bell 
  peppers have a way of doing that.&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;I'm 
  serious, man.  Have you ever seen the Dairy Queen billboard on highway 15?&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Yeah...&quot; 
  Irvine made sure to lengthen his response to indicate his hesitation in responding. 
  </font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">No 
  answer from Neil.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Yeah, 
  what?&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Neil 
  snapped out of his trance. &quot;It's great, isn't it?&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Dairy 
  Queen?&quot; said Irvine. &quot;It's okay, I guess.&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;The 
  billboard...&quot; whispered Neil.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;It's 
  okay, I guess,&quot; whispered Irvine, mocking Neil.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Don't 
  you see? The Blue is there.&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Er… 
  Is blue your favorite color or something?&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;No, 
  green.  But still.  That's not the point,&quot; gasped Neil, frustrated.  &quot;This 
  is not the color blue.  It's the Blue.  Listen.  I don't have to worry now.  
  You don’t, either, really.  Don't you see, Irvine?  Who needs work?  For I have 
  seen the Blue.&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;What 
  have you been smoking… and why haven’t you been sharing?&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;You 
  joke.  I would you understood, Irvine.  In many ways you're like a brother to 
  me.&quot;  Neil placed his hand on Irvine's shoulder.  Irvine quickly removed 
  it.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;We've 
  never talked, uh, outside this store.  I've never, uh, seen you in normal clothes.&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;A 
  brother in the Blue...&quot; Irvine’s every orifice hung open, adding extra 
  weight to his face.  Neil added: &quot;I'm going now, Irvine.&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Oh... 
  Kay...&quot; Irvine was more than stunned.  &quot;Do you want me to tell anyone 
  .. anything?&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;There 
  will be no need for that.&quot; Neil disappeared into the brightness outside.  
  Neil emerged from the light four minutes later and said, &quot;You wouldn't 
  happen to have any jumper cables, would you?&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Not 
  blue ones.&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Hm. 
  Thanks.&quot;</font></p>

<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
  sea crashed upon the shore, not violently, but to assure it that it had better 
  not step out of line. To the horizon stretched a rich teal, which could have 
  been green or blue depending on the mood of the onlooker.  It met with whispy 
  cirrus clouds.  The large gray rocks were far enough away from the shore so 
  as not to have been weathered down too much, and the sand didn't radiate any 
  particular heat.  At this point in March, most of the world had apologized, 
  packed its bags and left, except for the regular few that stayed and gave the 
  tract developers a job and money to advertise to the ones who would be trapped 
  next year.  The rest were doing whatever it was that kept them in line during 
  the week.</font></p>

  blended into the other, so if he had had a shirt on, it would be hard to tell 
  from far away how well it contrasted with the dark tan color of his skin.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:150%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">He 
  did have pants on.  They were slightly lighter in color than his shirt. His 
  gray hair extended mostly down but in every other direction as well, combined 
  with facial hair that would make Jerry Garcia jealous.  He sat in the sanctuary 
  under the rocks.  A young stranger walked by, and the man decided to make conversation. 
  He was too proud to ask for anything more than discussion over the weather.</font></p>

  only by those who truly envision it as the wonderful thing that it is!&quot; 
  The stranger ranted on. &quot;I see you have had some bad fortune in your life.  
  But it is not bad fortune, it is because you fail to see the Blue for what it 
  is.  Don't worry, friend.  I will help you.  Together we will acknowledge The 
  Blue and I will show you what I mean.&quot;</font></p>
