<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When You Care Enough<br>
  John Olson</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>
  <br>
  I discretely studied the man fidgeting nearby.  He paid me no heed while I pretended 
  to read the greeting card I held.  His age looked to be early twenties, as I 
  had been some decades ago, and he still bore the hard, wiry slimness of youth.  
  The shade of his hair and goatee also reflected his youth in their unrelieved 
  darkness where I showed flecks and streaks of gray.  He dressed down in baggy 
  California casual whereas I, having just come from court, wore one of my good 
  suits, today it was Armani.  It seemed that our only commonality, other than 
  gender, was to have chosen the same card shop filled with the quiet soft aromas 
  of scented candles and tons of paper stock.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">He tentatively reached for 
  another card, pulling it halfway out of its slot to read the hook, before making 
  a face and pushing it into oblivion.  His hands belonged to someone who worked 
  outdoors, but didn't look sufficiently toughened and scarred as to suggest he 
  did so exclusively.  He picked the card's neighbor and flipped it open to read 
  the sentiment.  Giving a sigh, he rejected it as well and shifted his weight 
  from foot to foot as he scanned the display of Valentine's Day cards.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">I don't know how long he 
  had been searching the rack, but he was already looking when I arrived and  
  I began to wonder if he'd still be there, gripped by indecision, by the time 
  I was ready to leave.  For no reason that likelihood irked me and I felt an 
  urge to do something about it.  My friends say I can't help myself, they call 
  this my <i>pro bono</i> instinct and when I get like this I offer help whether 
  or not it's been requested.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">I closed the card I had 
  been considering and looked over with a smile, &quot;Not easy is it?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">He glanced at me with a 
  touch of impatience in his eyes which showed in his voice as irritation.  &quot;Man, 
  you have no idea.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Oh, come on, give 
  me a little credit.  Maybe I do,&quot; I said tapping the card in my hand against 
  my graying head.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">He laughed and I saw him 
  relax a little.  I gave a low chuckle and pressed on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Who's it for?  Wife?  
  Fiancée?  Girlfriend?  Grandmother??&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Again he laughed, unwinding 
  a little more, &quot;No, just my girlfriend.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">'Just' his girlfriend.  
  &quot;Hmm.. from your mood I take she's not a new girlfriend?  I mean, if that 
  were the case, you'd grab the first hot and intense card you saw and be out 
  of here.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">He gave me a hard gaze, 
  seeing me for the first time, and took my measure.  His eyes narrowed before 
  he replied, &quot;Man, what's it to you?  I don't need some <i>suit</i> busting 
  my chops for fun on his lunch break.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">I took a half step back, 
  just enough to show some deference, but not flight.  &quot;Look, don't misunderstand, 
  I'm not trying to intrude.  It just seems to me that we're both making the same 
  decision but you're a little stuck.  I thought talking it through might help.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">He hesitated.  &quot;With 
  you?  I don't even know you and you sure as hell don't know anything about me.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">I spread open my hands in 
  a conciliatory gesture.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;That's exactly why.  
  You don't know me and there's safety in being unknown.  How can you possibly 
  be embarrassed or worried about what you say?  You could tell me she's the best 
  sex you've ever had or she's got the emptiest head and you know I can't judge 
  your words against reality, I can't be tempted or offended.  I don't know her 
  and I don't know you.  We're just two guys talking, and you won't see me again.  
  This gives you the freedom to say anything and walk away from it.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">He considered my words and 
  nodded in comprehension and acceptance of our nonexistent relationship.  Having 
  made that decision, he made another.  His lips squeezed together a bit before 
  he shrugged and answered.  &quot;We've been seeing each other for a couple of 
  years.  And it's not like we have problems, we're doing ok.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;So, what's the problem?  
  You should know her tastes by now.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;It's not like I don't 
  know what she likes.  I do.  Boy, do I.  But... Valentine's Day... I mean... 
  it's gotta say something from the inside, you know?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Yes, I do.  You're 
  right.  This isn't one of the canned card occasions like a birthday or wedding 
  or even Christmas when everyone gets a dozen cards or so.  We all know what 
  those cards are supposed to be like - 'hooray and have a happy' or 'congratulations' 
  or whatever.  This card is special and most of us only get one.  It is supposed 
  to describe how you feel about the person who gets and the relationship.  Unless 
  you're willing to lie, but that's a description too, isn't it?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">He nodded as I spoke, his 
  eyes intent and his agreement rushed out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Dude, that's it exactly.  
  Exactly it.  The card has to fit, y'know?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;But I still don't 
  see your dilemma.  There are plenty of cards here, surely one of them describes 
  your feelings.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Discomfort stole across 
  his face and he let out a long protracted breath,  &quot;Noooo, it's not that 
  easy.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">I laughed, &quot;Hey, now 
  that sounds familiar!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">He didn't return my laugh.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Man, after two years... 
  it's like.. I dunno, something's missing.  It's not like it was...&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">It was my turn to nod.  
  &quot;What?  As if something leaked out and you just noticed?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Pretty much.  Like, 
  we're the same, but it's different.  They got a card for that kind of feeling?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">I could see that he was 
  a decent guy, trying to be honest with his girl, but also skirting the real 
  issue to avoid an argument or worse.  That time might come, but not on this 
  day of lovers.  It would be resolved elsewhere so I stayed with the issue at 
  hand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Ahhh, I see.  What 
  you really want is a generic card to get you off the hook, but without committing 
  yourself to some kind of emotional fib.  Something that says &quot;I got you 
  this card because I'm expected to, so enjoy it for what it is, not some kind 
  of promise.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">He shuffled his feet and 
  gave a short jerked nod of his head.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">I shook my head.  &quot;Brother, 
  I think you're out of luck.  They don't make them like that.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Yeah, tell me about 
  it.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">We stood for a second or 
  two, each pondering.  I broke the silence.  &quot;You don't have to give her 
  a card.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Are you nuts?  Not 
  give her a Valentine's Day card?  I can think of easier ways of committing suicide.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Hear me out.  Normally 
  I'd agree with you, the absence of a card is a most grievous sin on Valentine's 
  Day, even if you remember the flowers.  However, if you gave a gift the missing 
  card may not be noticed.  Or, if it is, you can just say you were so excited 
  about the present, the card completely slipped your mind.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">He looked dubious.  &quot;I 
  don't know, man.&quot;  He frowned.  &quot;Like, what kind of present?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Well, once again, 
  this isn't your typical occasion.  The gift has to be something personal, not 
  practical.  Don't even think about bringing home a vacuum cleaner or VCR, no 
  matter how much she complained about the old one.&quot;  I tapped my card on 
  my chest, thinking. &quot;No, this is calls  for something basically useless, 
  but pretty.  Something whose whole function is to deliver a message: that you 
  care.  It will remind her of you each time she sees it.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Sooo.. clothes?  Perfume?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;No, clothes are too 
  practical unless you know she likes the kinds of things that scream to be taken 
  off, and perfume disappears with time.&quot;  I paused, remembering his apparent 
  income bracket, changed my words in the split second and waved at the various 
  statues and knick-knacks surrounding us in the card shop.  &quot;One of these 
  might do, if you choose wisely.  She's probably young enough that 'cute' carries 
  a lot of weight.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">He smiled, &quot;Yeah.. 
  and skip the card...  that's perfect.  Yeah, that'll work!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">He looked around at the 
  offerings of the store and shook his head.  &quot;Not this stuff, though.  I 
  know just where to go.  She'll love it.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">He thrust his hand out to 
  me, &quot; Thanks, man, I appreciate it.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">We clasped hands, mine office 
  soft and his hard-won rough, and pumped once in a short, respectful handshake.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;I hope I helped.  
  I wish you both the best of luck.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">With a final nod, he turned 
  on his heel and was through the door.  I grinned at his retreating back and 
  turned to face the display of cards.  I glanced again at the card I had been 
  holding and slipped it back into its slot under the section marked &quot;WIFE.&quot;  
  Maybe I'd have better luck in a different shop.  I still had a few hours left 
  before dinner.  I walked into the sunshine, only to hear a woman's voice following 
  me.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Sir!  Sir!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">I faced her, my eyebrows 
  raised in unspoken query. Her plump outstretched hand and knowing smile met 
  me.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;You left this by the 
  rack, sir.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">I took the small blue Tiffany's 
  bag and smiled back at her, &quot;Thank you  I would hate to go home tonight 
  empty handed.&quot;</font></p>
