<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Grandpa and the Coon Hunt 
  of ‘32<br>
  Nicole Nelson-Hicks</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">          “See this scar?” 
  Grandpa asked as he pushed up his sleeve. “I got that during a coon hunt back 
  in ’32.” The porch creaked as he leaned back in his ladderback rocking chair. 
  His young grandson sat nestled in his lap, waiting for a story, while the rest 
  of the family prepared Sunday dinner inside the house. “Biggest damn one we 
  ever treed. And mean! Lord, I’ll remember that one for the rest of my days. 
  The way it fought and scratched and cursed. OOOWEEE! It was a sight!”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">          “My daddy went 
  hunting once and brought back a deer head.” the little boy piped in. “Mom got 
  all mad.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">          Grandpa shook 
  his head laughing and looked down at the boy, “Let me tell you something, boy,” 
  he leaned forward, his head cocked. “Your Paw don’t know nothin’ about coon 
  huntin’.” He sat back and snorted. “Hmmph! He calls hisself a hunter. Boy, there’s 
  more to huntin’ than running out into the woods with a six pack of beer in one 
  hand and a rifle in the other. Nah……these young ones today….. don’t know nothing 
  of huntin’..of the chase.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">          “But…my Paw…he 
  knew. And he taught me….listen up-”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">          “There was always 
  a mess of them running across my Paw’s back field so we would set up traps, 
  wooden stakes- oh, about as big around as your leg and half as long, boy- all 
  around the back side, pointy side up. Paw and my Uncle Jed had trained the dogs 
  to corral the coons especially through this strip of land. It was one of my 
  Paw’s favorite tricks.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">          “My dog can do 
  tricks. Roll over, fetch, shake…all kinds of stuff. Ginger is a good dog.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">          “You wouldn’t 
  want nothing to do with these dogs, boy! These dogs weren’t for petting. These 
  dogs were for huntin’! They were the meanest pack of hounds I ever knew. You 
  could hear those dogs baying all over the hills as soon as they caught wind 
  of those coons. Then….Good Lord! You couldn’t hold them back! They’d bolt right 
  after them and run ‘em straight to the stakes. You could hear the coons a’screamin’ 
  as soon as they’d hit’em. Usually, we’d trap the bastards right there in the 
  stakes but that one in ’32 was a mean one. It just kept running, blood trailing 
  everywhere it went. But that was just fine by us ‘cause the dogs would get a 
  whiff and chase it all the harder. Lordy, that one in ’32 was a smart one and 
  kept just ahead of the pack. I figure we must’ve trailed that devil almost half 
  the night.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">          </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“I remember camping outside 
  in the back yard all night with my friends. It’s so dark out here in the country 
  at night. How did you all see to hunt?”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">          “The moon was 
  full that night, I recall. Shining like a yellow beacon. Besides, hounds don’t 
  depend on their eyes for huntin’. They use their sniffers.” he said, tapping 
  the side of his thin nose. “It’s better than radar.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">          The boy laughed. 
  “Cool.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">          “He’d run plumb 
  through Paw’s entire 10 acre field and smack into the old county graveyard. 
  Stupid thing had tripped over a gravestone and damn near broke a leg. Since 
  it was my first trip out- I was all of 12 at the time – my Uncle Jed figured 
  he’d let me do the honors. Somethin’ of an old tradition….my first blood.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">          “Kinda like how 
  last year, when I first turned six, my daddy let me hook my first worm at the 
  Shelby Park fishing rodeo?”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">          “Hmmmm. Something 
  like that.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">          The boy nodded, 
  understanding.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">          “So I stepped 
  forward, my rope in my hand, proud as a peacock, when…suddenly, all hell broke 
  loose! The damn fool started hollarin’ and clawin’ at the ground, throwin’ sticks 
  and a stones, anything that could be found on the ground. I raised up my arm 
  just in time to avoid catching a rock right in the eye. That’s where I got this 
  scar from.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">          Grandpa stopped 
  and pointed down again to the scar. The skin around it puckered like stitches 
  in a hastily sewn hem. The boy leaned closer to study it, touching it gingerly. 
  “Ewwww!”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">          Grandpa sat back. 
  “Well, we put up with enough that old coon. We picked up some good sized sticks 
  and went in to beat some sense into the creature’s head. But it kept on throwin’ 
  and screamin’ at us like were were a pack of wild dogs. I was fixing to go in 
  after it but my Uncle Jed pulled me aside and got out his shotgun. After that, 
  it was easy to drag it over to an old oak tree and hang it up proper.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">          “Wow. Did you 
  get to keep it?” the boy asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">          The old man sighed 
  and tussled his grandson’s hair. “Boy, you don’t know nothin’ about coon huntin’.”</font></p>
