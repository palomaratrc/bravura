  There I was, on a hot, muggy late afternoon in New York literally <i>stuck</i> 
  in my apartment. It was dinnertime and I was all ready to go out and do some 
  food shopping and I couldn’t get the front door open! I twisted and tugged with 
  all my might but nothing—the door wouldn’t budge. I didn’t know what to do!  
  My live-in boyfriend was out raising money for a new show we were doing, so 
  he wasn’t near a phone. It was rush hour, so all my other friends would be on 
  trains in transit on their way home. My windows were too high up to jump to 
  the street and there wasn’t even a fire escape. I tried the door several times, 
  paced around the apartment and finally figured I’d better call the police. I 
  went into the bedroom, which I had painted the week before a bright brick color. 
  In the heat and humidity, the room was uncomfortable, but I sat on the bed and 
  called the New York City police department.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span>“Ya 
  what?”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span>“I 
  can’t get out of my apartment.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span>“Lady, 
  don’t ya have a key?”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span>“No, 
  I’m not locked <i>out</i> of my apartment, I’m locked <i>in</i>. I can’t get 
  out the front door. It’s stuck!”</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span>I 
  felt like an idiot and I’m sure the sergeant thought I was pulling his leg. 
  He told me he couldn’t help me and to try the fire department. So, I called 
  the fire department, told them the situation and they said they’d be right there. 
  Great, I thought!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>       </span>It was 
  a little after five-thirty in the afternoon. I lived on Watts Street just above 
  Soho which is the street that leads to the Holland Tunnel. All the traffic using 
  the tunnel from Manhattan to New Jersey had to travel along our little street. 
  During rush hour, the street was no longer a quaint, cobblestone and brick lane, 
  but a crowded, congested thoroughfare crammed with not two lanes but at least 
  four. People sometimes drove up on the sidewalk just to get into the tunnel 
  a little ahead of someone else or maybe get home three minutes earlier. I looked 
  down from my third- story living room window and saw the madhouse down there: 
  traffic was stacked up, horns rudely honking.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span>The 
  next thing I know, sliding down the street with ease, comes this humungous red 
  fire engine blaring it’s siren. Cars moved to the left to allow it to stop at 
  <i>my </i>door. Not only that, but up came an official New York City firefighter 
  ladder and it was aimed at <i>my</i> window. I mean, I knew they were coming, 
  but somehow I didn’t expect this! I stepped back into the room and in through 
  my window bounded a tall handsome man dressed in suspenders, and high boots. 
  My, he was virile! He had thick, dark curly hair, wet with perspiration and 
  dark eyes to knock your socks off. For some unexplained reason, I immediately 
  felt like a princess in a tower! I don’t know what came over me; I was always 
  so practical, so able to take care of myself, but somehow having this big, rugged 
  man come in through my window and stand six-foot tall in my living room, I felt 
  giddy and overly feminine, like I was tittering around in spiked high heels! 
  I fluttered out what the problem was and this gallant man went over to try to 
  open my front door.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span>Outside 
  in the hall, I could hear his fellow firefighters talking and moving about. 
  I thought maybe there were a two or three of them. He told them to push the 
  door when he pulled. (I remained in the background in my high heels!) After 
  several minutes, the door burst open and in rushed <i>five</i> more firemen, 
  again dressed for duty in their suspenders and high boots. They were all boyish 
  and muscular. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span>“Oh! 
  Thank you! Thank you <i>so</i> much! “ I gushed. “I couldn’t get it open and 
  I tried and I tried. Last week the same thing happened, my boyfriend and I couldn’t 
  get out of the bedroom all day----“          </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span>They 
  all stared at me and smiled: big, beautiful manly smiles.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span>“Oh, 
  I mean, well, we finally did get <i>out</i> of the bedroom—“ </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span>A 
  couple of them snickered. I felt like I was wearing something from Frederick’s 
  of Hollywood.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span>“Do 
  you have a bar of soap?” asked the Knight in Shining Armor.                               <br>
  <span>            </span>  I was puzzled, but I gave him what he asked for. He took the soap and rubbed 
  it around the edges of the door</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span><span style='font-family:Eurostile'>“Why 
  are you doing that?” I asked him.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>         </span>He 
  looked directly at me and said, “I smelled that you’ve recently painted the 
  apartment. When you painted, you painted the edges of the doors and the doorjambs. 
  In the heat and humidity, the paint swelled. That’s why the door stuck,” he 
  told me kindly. His eyes sparkled and his strong white teeth showed when he 
  smiled</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span>I 
  felt so embarrassed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>         </span>“Oh. 
  My. God. I can’t believe it! Well, thank you! I’m sure sorry to bring all you 
  guys up here for just that!” </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span>They 
  smiled, a few laughed a little but said that it was okay, no problem, that was 
  their job and so on. I watched as they filed down the hall, their broad shoulders 
  and strong arms showed beneath their green tee shirts I listened as their friendly 
  banter disappeared out into the street. The man with the dark eyes went out 
  the way he came in, through the window. He was extremely agile despite his big 
  black boots.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            </span>When 
  they all left, I was alone again. I was finally able to leave my apartment, 
  but somehow I didn’t want to just yet. I lay down on the ruby red comforter 
  on my bed. I lay down, closed my eyes and just imagined. </font> </p>
