<p class=p2 style='line-height:28.0pt;'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Yesterday, 
  while I was out in the yard (again), it seemed to me that I have been raking 
  leaves all my life.  No, not continuously --I have taken time out to discover 
  girls, learn basic auto repair, gain an education, and build a career, among 
  other pursuits.</font></p>
<p class=p2 style='line-height:28.0pt;'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">What 
  I mean is, as far back as my memory stretches, I have stood at all ages with 
  rake in hand, faced with the chore of gathering and disposing of deciduous discards.  
  All ages except for those barren years in El Paso, Texas.  My memory tells me, 
  no doubt accurately, that El Paso has not a single tree, but has miles and miles 
  of rough, superheated, baked desert floor and an occasional cactus under which 
  a lizard rests in patient vigil.  Instead of leaves, my father insisted I rake 
  the sand.  I think he wanted to make sure I didn't lose my competitive edge.</font></p>
<p class=p2 style='line-height:28.0pt;'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Regardless, 
  once the sultry days of summer had disappeared into last month<sup>'</sup>s 
  tee-shirt sweat stains, I was inevitably confronted with the perennial task.   
  Personally, I never saw the need for the job.  Didn't my father realize that 
  if he would just show a little patience, Mother Nature would take care of the 
  problem herself by natural decomposition or, at least, with a good strong breeze?  
  My word, he was an impatient man.  I didn't realize at the time that his career 
  as a soldier had instilled in him a sense that an area should be kept neat and 
  I, having idle hands and a near vacant head, was the ideal labor force to insure 
  that one aspect of the yard was pleasing to the eye.  Confronted by this never-ending 
  cycle, I was forced to develop survival skills.  Depending upon the size of 
  the yard and the number of shedding trees, those skills included a good deal 
  of escapist thought.</font></p>
<p class=p2 style='line-height:28.0pt;'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
  worst yard I ever confronted coincidentally (hmm... is there such a thing?)  
  belonged to the house wherein we resided for the longest consecutive string 
  of time, those years following Dad's retirement from the Army.  I remember it 
  as I first explored its long bending shape, from front to rear.  I recall four 
  tall wood and leafy barons, each holding a fiefdom of my father's kingdom.  
  I stood at the foot of each of them, squinting into their rustling branches, 
  taking their measure.  They, in turn, paid scant attention to me as they placidly 
  went about their existence of towering above the chaos and scurrying disorder 
  which plagued the surface world.  In the next few years I came to know each 
  of them and find boyish uses for each of their unique attribute.</font></p>
<p class=p7 style='line-height:28.0pt;'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">            
  Filling most of the front yard, by the sidewalk, grew the tree which caught 
  the brunt of my childhood clambering into adventurous heights.  This was also 
  the tree which reached out and snagged away,<sub> </sub>from my playmates and 
  I, many a balsa wood airplane in flight and toy soldier equipped with the most 
  modern of home manufactured parachutes.  As much as I liked to climb that elm 
  tree, which also gave the porch a great deal of cool summer shade, I heard and 
  hated the silent scream of each leaf  it sent plummeting to the ground.  After 
  all, I knew I would be responsible for clearing away each and every one of them.</font></p>
<p class=p2 style='line-height:28.0pt;'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
  side yard was long and wide, admirably suited for our summer of croquet madness 
  and a later flirtation with archery.  The flirtation miraculously vanished the 
  bare instant I shot an arrow straight into the sky. Immediately I realized I 
  had absolutely <i>no </i>idea where that pointed deadly missile would come down 
  and I sprinted for the shelter of our roof's eave but the crown of my head acquired 
  a vulnerable feeling which I have not lost.  This length of property had as 
  its vegetative glory two trees fused into one trunk which then divided again 
  into two separate growths.  It (they?) could not compete as the best tree for 
  climbing but it provided welcome shade as well as a fine place for me to lurk 
  in ambush.  Armed only with imagination and a cast off crooked branch as a rifle, 
  I would watch erstwhile friends, now the enemy, cross into the splendid field 
  of fire blissfully ignorant of their impending noisy, albeit bloodless, demise.  
  The &quot;V&quot; of the trunks made for an excellent rifle rest and provided 
  wonderful protection from their invisible bullets.</font></p>
<p class=p2 style='line-height:28.0pt;'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
  back yard was dominated by a huge black chestnut tree which was inhabited, or 
  at least visited, by hordes of ravenous grey squirrels.  This giant's contributions 
  did not stop with the normal layer of stricken leaves.  Treacherously hidden 
  among those leaves were black chestnut husks gnawed into jagged caltrops.  As 
  if to prove that one tree could provide sustenance for any number of squirrels, 
  there were also numerous unscathed nuts still dangling which managed to escape 
  the questing paws and sharp incisors of the furry predators.  Whether chewed 
  or intact, black chestnuts provide even the most die-hard would-be Huck Finn 
  or Tom Sawyer with painfully obvious reasons to wear shoes.</font></p>
<p class=p2 style='line-height:28.0pt;'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Finally, 
  scarred and hunched, bowed and crooked, shoved in a corner of the yard where 
  Dad would park his Studebaker truck, was an ancient oak.  The tree and the pick-up 
  deserved each other and were almost inseparable companions.  Both had seen better 
  days and both were slowly returning to their raw elemental states despite our 
  puny attempts to maintain their haggard existences.  During the long quiet nights 
  I could hear them groaning to each other as they compared their varied ailments 
  and complaints.  In my youth, disrespectful of age or wisdom, I would strip 
  hunks of bark from the weathered centurion simply because it was old and seemed 
  to invite such abuse.  Its retribution came, as did the others', each autumn.</font></p>
<p class=p4 style='line-height:28.0pt;'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">            
  Summer heat eventually faded into cooler days and chilly nights.  Shadows grew 
  long earlier and shiny green grass and leaves curled into tones of brown or 
  rampant orange, yellow, and red.  Each year I watched in horror as leaves which 
  had resisted the winds of the summer tornado season now, for no good reason, 
  simply let slip their grasps on parent limbs and whirled to the foreboding earth.  
  One after another, they surrendered their high perches in light and air to join 
  us earthbound mortals in the shadows.  Despite my best efforts with my mother's 
  lacquer-like hair spray, I could not keep those leaves stuck to their branches.  
  I couldn't understand it.  I'd seen my mother walk through gale force winds 
  without a hair out of place thanks to that canned shellac. Helpless, I watched 
  the faded grass lie down beneath a carpet of multi-hued carcasses.  Eventually, 
  my father would gauge that enough of the little bits of natural litter had accumulated.  
  On that day my annual torture would begin - he would point me toward the tool 
  shed and announce that the time had come for me to actually earn my allowance.</font></p>
<p class=p2 style='line-height:28.0pt;'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">How 
  many times have I stood surveying the field of contest while formulating my 
  campaign?  Through hard experience in our previous yards, large and small, I 
  had learned that one does not just grab a rake and start flailing.  Oh, no.  
  A mental map must be drawn, a route devised, a series of pile locations plotted, 
  and a plan formulated.  I had found that I could not just push all those leaves 
  ahead of me in an ever growing pile.  At some point the pile would shed more 
  leaves than I pushed into it!  No, no -- the thing to do was subdivide the field 
  to be raked into lesser leaf gathering sectors and removal bags would have to 
  be staged at each pile point.  Then, and only then, would I apply angled steel 
  tines to withered vegetation.</font></p>
<p class=p2 style='line-height:28.0pt;'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Once 
  I began the job I was faced with the tedium of repetitious labor.  Stroke, stroke, 
  stroke, step, step, stroke, stroke, stroke, step, step.  .  .  Boredom would 
  sprout almost immediately.  Soon I had no choice but to escape into some kind 
  of interactive fantasy.  In my mind the leaves became unruly beeves which had 
  to rounded up and formed into orderly herds.  Or, the leaves were a form of 
  bacteria blocking the sunlight from the dying grass, and I was here to save 
  the grass by scraping away the vicious infection!  Or, the bright colors became 
  lines of Napoleon's nemesis, the British army - advancing in long ragged lines 
  across the battlefield.</font></p>
<p class=p2 style='line-height:28.0pt;'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Lost 
  in these escapist dreams T could rake hour after hour, occasionally brought 
  back to reality by the harsh sting of a burst blister or the mundane matter 
  of seizing armfuls of the piled discards and jamming them into a bag.  At some 
  point in the day I could look back at my accomplishment, an expanse of lawn 
  cleared of obscurement!  Even as I admired my work, first one, then two, then 
  twenty, leaves would gracefully float downward and land gingerly in my footsteps.  
  With a heavy sigh, I would realize that this was my fate for the next month, 
  maybe two, of weekends.  Raking.  Gathering.  Bagging.  Dragging.  Watching.  
  Waiting.  Raking.  All the while, in the back of my head I knew that in the 
  distant future I would have my own children and I would never again in my life 
  <i>touch </i>a rake, much less actually <i>use </i>the foul implement.</font></p>
<p class=p2 style='line-height:28.0pt;'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">That 
  is how I spent every autumn until I finally left home at age eighteen.  Now, 
  twenty-two years later, so much has changed.  Instead of the huge section of 
  Kansas prairie, my horizon has shrunk to a California residential lot.  On my 
  property are two young trees, barely old enough to stand unassisted but unreasonably 
  prolific.  I have my own rakes which I keep in the garage, not the tool shed.  
  I'm taller, heavier, more learned, but I am childless and the leaves still drop.  
  With deep resignation I grasp the slightly roughened wood shaft and step outside 
  to put my skills and imagination to the test once more.  In silent expectation 
  the ancient enemy rustles and dances.  I sigh, lower the tines, and...  stroke, 
  stroke, stroke, step, step, stroke, stroke, stroke, step, step.</font></p>
<p class=p2 style='line-height:28.0pt;'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Yes, 
  I <i>know </i>why the season is called &quot;fall.&quot; It seems to me that 
  I have been raking leaves all my life.</font></p>
