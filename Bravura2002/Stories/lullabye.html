<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
  Different Kind of Lullabye<br>
  Nicole Nelson-Hicks</font>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The cracked linoleum is so 
  cold beneath her bare feet. She shifts from foot to foot as the water boils, 
  rubber nipples and plastic caps bubbling around, dancing. A yellow egg timer 
  in the shape of a chicken lays down a steady tempo. She stares at this dance, 
  her eyes transfixed whether by the motion of the bottle caps or from sheer exhaustion 
  she can’t even tell anymore. A box of goodies given by the Navy hospital sits 
  on the card table next to the hot plate on the counter that plays as a stove. 
  In the box is the last can of formula. She tries not to think about this as 
  she watches the water boil, holding her hands high over the steam to soak in 
  the wet heat and take away a little of the night chill that has soaked into 
  her bones and just won’t go away. The egg timer buzzes and scares her so badly 
  she nearly scalds herself as she takes the pot off the hot plate, scoops out 
  the nipples and caps with a wooden spoon and lays them to dry on a paper towel. 
  She fixes the disposable bottle liners in place and uses the can opener from 
  her husband’s Swiss army knife to open the final can of formula. She pours it 
  carefully, all the way to the brim, into four eight-ounce bottles. These will 
  last until tomorrow afternoon. Then, tomorrow, somehow,</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">somewhere 
  she will have find some more. Damn. She cups her breasts, useless things. They 
  look so pretty in the wrapper, don’t they? She sighs. Nothing is ever simple, 
  is it? She puts three bottles into the compact fridge her husband has “appropriated”. 
  That’s what grunts in the military call stealing. Nothing is ever really “stolen” 
  as it is “appropriated” to serve another cause. The whole façade  used to bother 
  her at first but pawn money those “appropriated” items brought in enough grocery 
  money to soothe any moral queasiness she used to have.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">She keeps one bottle with her 
  to have at the ready when the little tyrant wakes up. With that motherly chore 
  done, she flips off the kitchen light and makes her way in the dark, through 
  the living room, to the bedroom. A nightlight shines dimly and casts a web of 
  shadows on the baby sleeping in the playpen. A piece of the shadow breaks away 
  and scuttles across and up the wall. She slaps at it without thinking and the 
  baby barks out a cry, wiggling</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">weakly 
  inside the tightly bound blankets. “Shhhhh! Shhhhh, Baby……shhhhh, it’s okay. 
  Momma’s here.” She reaches towards the baby and sees the stain of the smashed 
  bug on her hand. She grimaces and stands for a second, holding her hand away 
  from her like a leper. “Hold on, Baby, hold on….”, she says, glancing towards 
  her sleeping husband. He is stirring. The bathroom is only three steps away. 
  She hurries inside where there is a tub and a toilet. She sets the bottle on 
  the toilet tank and turns the knob in the tub and runs her hands under the cold, 
  cold water. Thinking twice, she grabs a sliver of soap left in the dish and 
  lathers her hands. The baby’s cries outside crescendo. “I’m coming, Baby, just 
  hold on, for crying out loud….” She rinses her hands in the already warming 
  water. Great, she thinks, now I have to pee. She hears the crying stop. Alarmed, 
  she half dries her hands on the towel hanging over the shower rod and grabs 
  the bottle. She goes to the door and looks into the playpen. Empty. She hears 
  a sweet gurgle.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Her husband has gotten up and 
  is holding the baby. He has wrapped himself and the baby in their old blue bed 
  sheets. In the dimness of the nightlight, with his closely cropped hair, he 
  looks like a shimmering Buddhist monk. She smiles at that thought. God, I must 
  really be tired. My husband, the Marine……how would he feel about the comparison?</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Don’t worry, Hon. I’ve got 
  her.” He reaches out to her. “Hand me the bottle.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Here.” She says and sits down 
  next to them on the mattress on the floor. Beds are a hassle to travel with, 
  are expensive and, besides, when the baby gets older, we won’t have to worry 
  about her falling off in the middle of the night and hurting herself, right? 
  She hears this litany from her husband at least once a month. She figures he 
  needs to hear it himself more than she does by now. He cradles the baby in his 
  arms and teases the lips of the now sleeping baby with the nipple. “Just look 
  at her.” He says, “Out cold. She just wanted a little snuggle time with Dada, 
  that’s all.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">She smiles, weakly, and says, 
  “I’ll take her. You go on back to sleep now. You need it for the hump coming 
  up.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“I’m okay. I’ll be just fine.” 
  He caresses her cheek gently against is neck, carefully, away from his stubble. 
  He brings her to his face and kisses her on the nose. “Just look at her. Isn’t 
  she beautiful?”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">She looks at him and marvels 
  at his dopey radiance. Sitting there on a lumpy mattress in an infested apartment 
  holding his baby and he looks like he is King of the World. She couldn’t see 
  herself but she was certain no one who might’ve stumbled onto their two a.m. 
  slumber party would’ve thought as graciously about her. The only mirror she 
  had seen herself in lately was in the bathroom with that damn fluorescent lighting. 
  She tried to convince herself that it was the lighting that made her look so 
  bad, the shadows cast under her eyes were just tricks of the bulb. But she knew 
  she was just lying to herself again. Where is my glow?</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Her husband stands up, cuddling 
  his baby, and walks with her, rocking her deeper into sleep. He is singing a 
  song but so low under his breath that she can’t make it out clearly. He looks 
  good in his boxers, his hard Marine Corps body sculpted and fingered by the 
  moonlight coming in through the slotted blinds. She wants to want him but where 
  there used to be fire there is nothing, a hole. Is that where the glow went?</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“You know,” he says, “when 
  I look at her, I can’ t help wondering how anyone could hurt something like 
  this. So beautiful and innocent. Can you?”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">She sighs and lies across the 
  mattress that lays on the floor in the only other room of an infested apartment 
  wit crackled linoleum and whispers, “No. I can’t.” and drifts off to sleep.</font></p>
