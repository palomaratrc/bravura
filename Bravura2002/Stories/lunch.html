  Where to end, where to begin?  Every pseudo-intellectual philosophy I’ve meandered 
  in, every single last bottle of beer, all the hours drowning in novels and stories 
  of other people’s lives so I don’t have to face my own, all the long walks at 
  night staring into space, all the strip bars and girls gone wild, all the faking 
  and acting I did so I would have someone to call my friend, all the volumes 
  of really bad poetry I’ve written, the journals, the trips to Alaska and Mexico 
  and Europe, the dozens of classes and essays, the cathedral visits, all the 
  songs by Radiohead and The Smiths I listened to before I even liked them, all 
  the bad movies and especially the good ones, all the running I did on a treadmill 
  hours on end going nowhere for seven plus years, all of it, has gotten me a 
  pile of shit.  This shit, the substance of my life, doesn’t even contain nutrients 
  necessary to be used as fertilizer, it won’t burn, it’s pale brown, without 
  any interesting folds and it doesn’t even really smell.  </font></p>

  I’ve heard the devil looks like a red bull with steam rising from his eyes, 
  big flapping tail, ugly as a mother fucker, would make a Yeti piss himself, 
  but I think these descriptions come from overly ambitious mama’s boys who have 
  never seen his mug. They say his touch would eat like acid through your bones, 
  but they’ve never been right there by his side.  I’ll tell you, and it’s the 
  truth, the devil is no bull and he’s got no horns, and he’s not even a he, I’ve 
  seen Satan (or at least his spawn) and she’s an eighteen-year-old blond with 
  teeth whiter than hell, a form like a Greek statue, smells like vanilla, eyes 
  like a Mediterranean sea, and her touch? well it’s finer than the rarest Asian 
  silk, and it’s got crazy Haitian powers and it transforms the lives of relatively 
  decent boys into food that not even worms will eat.</font></p>

  You know, that felt kind of good, for a second, writing about the devil who 
  fucked me over thoroughly (I mean this only figuratively) and who after walking 
  away from Coco’s that last day (Coco’s for god’s sake!), with no more thought 
  of me than if she had stepped into a piece of bubble gum and rubbed it off carefully 
  on the filthy puke stained curb and got back in her pink Barbie convertible 
  and driven to Malibu where the sidewalks are shiny and the poodles wear little 
  booties to protect them from the cold January concrete that seizes up the joints 
  of those more vulnerable, had the nerve to say hi to me the next Monday at school.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:14.35pt'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">            
  So the story goes like this, you can guess it I’m sure, fall in love big time, 
  like no one ever, felt her angelic chords resounding through my soul, all that 
  shit, picking her up at night with no place really in mind to go (I know, I 
  know, I was such a fucking teenager), checking the right side mirror all the 
  time as an excuse to get a glimpse of her face, telling ridiculously dumb jokes 
  knowing those would get the biggest laugh, looking briefly at her thigh, regretting 
  it and thinking it would defile our purest union (all the time we were together 
  I jacked off <i>maybe</i> four times), hanging my arm out the window and feeling 
  the bright wind like a river pumping life and vitality into my every neuron, 
  listening to her petite voice, and smiling.  I smiled a lot in those days.  
  Once in a while we’d park at a restaurant or the beach or at Malibu Grand Prix 
  (I really hate the word Malibu) and race go-carts.  I would at times start talking 
  about big engines and quarter miles so I’d look like a man (do girls like men?), 
  and besides, without the vacuous and space filling chatter every syllable that 
  would escape from my lips would be an iloveyou iloveyou, over and over and I’d 
  end up looking like a real jerk.  Ever since Coco’s (god, why Coco’s?!), I’ve 
  learned to skillfully mask my ihateyou ihateyous into comparable mindless talk.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:14.35pt'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">            
  You know what she said at Coco’s (!) that really pushed that old arrow right 
  down to the end? it was the –I don’t think I feel the same way about you that 
  you feel about me– (smile a little, not too much, push harder)  –You’re a great 
  guy– (thanks so much, that’s wonderful!)  –but– (hesitation) –well, maybe you 
  need to grow up a bit– (cork your tears, cork your tears, should I stab her?)  
  –or, maybe we’re just on two different levels– (frozen like an Atlantic snapper)  
  –and of course (a break here, you know what’s coming, cliché, puke, cliché) 
  we’ll still be friends– (well of course!).</font></p>
<p style='line-height:14.35pt'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">            
  (Seven damn mother fucking years and all I’m doing is still thinking about that 
  day.  What deviant psychological element creates a man like me?)</font></p>
<p style='line-height:14.35pt'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">            
  And so on and so on, I go home, step inside my room, feel like the walls are 
  squeezing me, (what (god) the fuck do I do now?)  put on a hooded sweater, walk 
  outside, and the corks they just come popping out, I don’t even realize it until 
  I start tasting my own snot.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:14.35pt'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">            
  You think I’m a fool deluded and bitter, or that I am still a silly half man?  
  Well, my thesis stands, that girl deserves a share in the destiny she chose 
  for me.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:14.35pt'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">            
  So there at Coco’s (I still can’t eat chocolate) I mainly nod my head and tell 
  her I understand (I thought we were just having lunch baby) my glottis clogged 
  with a million one word questions.  I wouldn’t care what her answer was, just 
  to hear that petite voice tackling those million and a billion after that, and 
  to occasionally touch her wrist in the middle of a sentence, I could delude 
  my eyes into seeing a lover, if only a sticky rubber bench and a wanna-be wood 
  table in Coco’s would be our Olympus.  But alas! she pulls away in her shitty 
  pickup, with a troll swinging from the rearview mirror smiling at me, and out 
  out out of my dream forever.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:14.35pt'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">            
  Okay, time for an obligatory pseudo-philosophical rant.  Do you think maybe 
  she doesn’t deserve eternal fire?  Well, maybe that’s a little extreme (is it?), 
  but don’t you see? <i>it</i> (human pain) isn’t my fault, it can’t be.  I have 
  never worn a virgin face, free of makeup, a nose whose proportion to the eyes 
  and cheek and down to thin pink lips are such that make even sensible men allude 
  to (gulp, squint, (dare I?) flinch, no I will not say angels) something or other.  
  I’ve never been beautiful enough to scorch a human heart, and it is thus I trumpet 
  my un-guilt (is there such a thing as innocence?).  Only a demon’s tike could 
  elicit rapture yet fail to complete the journey to Elysium.  That day at Coco’s 
  (of all fucking places!) she knew her role as god and she willfully withheld 
  the antidote to a life of futility and disillusionment.  She sat across the 
  table, batted those eyes, and decreed my condemnation (what does all this mean?).  
  And what (god) was it that cast me like the Morning Star from any hope of happiness? 
  was it the teddy bear I got for her? or the note I gave her (I’ll never divulge 
  it’s contents) along a rose on her doorstep?  I used to believe in Christian 
  karma, but it’s clear we’re in a Bizarro world... authenticity breeds isolation... 
  with reflection comes madness... faith earns a good whipping... and show a little 
  passion? a little honesty? well, you get scraped onto a puke stained curb for 
  seven years.  (for pity allow a little scream?)  Oh, to be a fool, I’d trade 
  up my soul.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:14.35pt'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">            
  You know there’s times when my demon stops gnawing on my abdomen for a little 
  while, and I think that maybe things (?) will work out all right.  I, after 
  all, have a decent job (it fills some time), nice family (my dad stopped drinking 
  long enough to attend my college graduation) who think I’m a peach, and some 
  other bullshit that (in America’s dream) should satisfy me fine.  And then... 
  I hear a little laugh, or one of a thousand visions, and it pulls me back into 
  a world of whores (too dramatic?) and my fate (must I love it?) is to keep running 
  on a treadmill until another vision knocks me on my ass.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:14.35pt'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">            
  Here I’ll make a little confession.  I’d gladly lie in rat piss for any one 
  of those visions  (The devil’s poison feels good going down).  There’s the one 
  with the cherry dress she wore her birthday night at some concert, hair pulled 
  back, her neck gloriously bare of any necklace.  She pulls me into a hallway, 
  we’re alone, and she hands me a note and says that I’m not the only one who 
  has trouble expressing himself.  And she gives me a Mediterranean stare, and 
  not able to hold it any longer she pulls me in for a hug.  My hand eases over 
  the little wrinkles in her cherry dress, her warm body is pressing me, and a 
  few stray hairs tickle the tip of my nose.  It’s been seven years, but that 
  Mediterranean eye has lost no heat.  Would you believe there’s a much deadlier 
  arrow than that one?  If I could capture the mixture of hunger and hurt of this 
  one vision in a thousand page novel, I know I’d win a Nobel.  The abridged version: 
  she stands in a doorway, turns her head back as her mother says something to 
  her, nervously holding a red sweatshirt.  I don’t dare elaborate any further.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:14.35pt'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">            
  Sometimes more than just flashbacks knock me on my ass.  I saw two twentysomethings 
  at the park next to my house kissing the other day.  They genuinely looked happy.  
  To cope in these situations I often prescribe for myself a dose of some condescending 
  sentiment and walk away telling myself that her grapes were probably sour anyway.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:14.35pt'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">            
  But in the end, you know, I’ve come to really love my shit.  And the question 
  I guess I’ve never thought to ask... what if at Coco’s we had split a nice club 
  sandwich, walked away hand in hand, and become that kissing couple in the park?  
  What miserable fool would I have become?  So lost in happiness that I never 
  saw the world for what it was, and missed out on the dark and yet beautiful 
  truths that I’ve come to define myself by?  I’d surely be much sillier than 
  I am now.  And what grand responsibility to the world would I be bypassing, 
  which (confusingly) I am somehow fulfilling right now?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">            Could Paul have 
  gotten it all wrong?  Could an eighteen year-old demon be the Savior from a 
  life of absurdity?  That’s what I’ll tell myself anyway.</font></p>
