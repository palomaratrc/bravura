</font>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“I 
  don’t have time right now. Get your father to do it.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“But 
  you <i>said</i>-“</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Don’t 
  argue with me, Megan! I <i>said</i> I don’t have time right now! When I drop 
  you off at your father’s, you can ask him to take you to McDonald’s. Now go 
  get your shoes, or we’re going to be late!” Megan’s mom glanced at her Rolex 
  without seeing the time.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Megan 
  left the room. The seven-year-old pushed her bedroom door open, slamming it 
  against the wall. She hoped her mom heard. Megan grabbed a pair of sandals and 
  walked out to the car.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">On 
  the ride to her father’s apartment, Megan said, “I hate Dad’s house. There’s 
  nothing fun to do there. Why can’t you let Dad watch me at your house?”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Because 
  I don’t trust your father around my stuff.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Why 
  don’t you let me stay at Grandma’s, then?”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“It’s 
  too far away.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“It’s 
  only thirty more minutes away!”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Megan, 
  stop arguing! It’s not like you’re going to be spending the night there. I’ll 
  be back to pick you up before 6:00. I promise.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">A 
  few red lights passed before Megan spoke again. “If you don’t trust Dad, and 
  if you hate him so much, then why did you ever marry him?”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Megan 
  could tell her mom was getting upset. “People do stupid things when they’re 
  young,” was all she said. She glanced at Megan. “Why aren’t you buckled up? 
  Buckle up. Now. You know I could get a ticket if a cop sees you without your 
  seat belt on?”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Megan 
  did as she was told. She looked at her mom. Sometimes, her mom was the most 
  beautiful woman in the world. Other times, though, she was ugly and Megan hated 
  her. Like now. “You promised,” Megan said quietly.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Her 
  mom’s painted eyebrows drew together in slight confusion. Then she realized 
  what Megan meant. She sighed. “I’m sorry I didn’t take you to McDonald’s, Megan. 
  Really, it’s not that big of a deal, though. You’ll live.”</font></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">*     
  *     *     *     *</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Megan 
  was tucked away in her father’s apartment. The small, stuffy room had a smell 
  that never left. It reminded her of the smell of the alfalfa fields where her 
  other grandparents lived. <i>Bitter</i>. The carpet was stained with cigarette 
  burns, and there was a naked mattress laying in the middle of the room. A large 
  lamp that had been knocked over weeks ago lay on the floor beside the bed, and 
  a few dirty t-shirts were scattered around. </font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Small 
  sunlight pixies that danced in front of the window caught Megan’s attention. 
  They were the only thing she liked about her father’s apartment. Her dad had 
  told her that these pixies were just dust. But she knew better. <i>Dust</i> 
  was the thick layer of gray stuff that covered the windowsill. It was the graveyard 
  of the pixies. Megan had watched pixies die before. They landed on that gray 
  sheet and never returned. The pretty, floating specks that made the sunlight 
  glitter- those were pixies. Living pixies.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Megan 
  reached out to touch the hundreds of small pixies dancing in the beams of sunlight 
  that escaped the outside world and landed in the dark room. The gray blinds, 
  no matter how tightly shut, couldn’t keep the light out. And as long as the 
  light was there, so were the pixies.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Megan 
  grabbed at the pixies, but when she opened her hand, it was empty. She tried 
  again, faster this time, and she tried harder to ignore the talk her parents 
  were having just outside the room.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Fuck, 
  Laura, why do you always have to dump her off on me every time I get a goddamn 
  day off?”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Her 
  mom’s voice was softer than her dad’s, but Megan could hear it just as clearly. 
  “Because she’s your daughter, too, and I hardly ever ask you to babysit her!”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“You 
  <i>always</i> make me babysit her. Every single fucking day off I’ve had since 
  I got this apartment, I’ve had to watch her.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Who’s 
  the one that pays for this apartment, Larry? <i>Me</i>, that’s who. Without 
  me, you’d be on the streets. You <i>owe</i> me.”</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Megan 
  heard her father’s mocking laughter. “Look at this place, Laura. <i>Look</i> 
  at this fucking place! It’s a dump! You give me enough money to pay rent and 
  buy food, and that’s <i>it</i>! I don’t owe you shit.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“You 
  <i>do</i> owe me, and since I’m the one paying the rent, you’re going to watch 
  her.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Megan 
  heard the front door slam and high heels march against the cement floor just 
  outside the window. She watched as the bars of light were, for a second, torn 
  by her mother’s shadow. She heard the heels stop. The car door opened, then 
  banged shut, and then her mom drove away.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Good,” 
  Megan said, still trying to catch the pixies. “We don’t need her anyway.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">A 
  few more moments of trying to catch the pixies passed before the playground 
  at McDonald’s crept back into Megan’s thoughts. She decided it was time to go 
  say hi to her dad. </font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">He 
  sat on a torn, dull orange couch. He had a hairy chest- that tangled, gray mass 
  of curls was always the first thing she noticed about her father whenever she 
  saw him. The second thing she noticed was the large roll of fat that hung over 
  his jeans. It reminded her of Play-Doh.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Dad, 
  do you have any Play-Doh?”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“No. 
  Why do you always ask me that?” her dad asked, irritated.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“I’m 
  bored.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Aren’t 
  we all?” Her dad’s eyes, where they should have been white, were pink, the shade 
  Megan imagined pixies’ dresses were.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“I 
  played with the pixies- oops!- I mean, I tried to catch the dust for you, while 
  I was in your room.”</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Great.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Megan 
  nodded, happy. “That’s something I can do whenever I come over to your house-“</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Megan, 
  I’ve told you before, it’s not called a goddamn house. It’s called an <i>apartment</i>. 
  Jesus Christ, if you’re going to say it, say it right. You sound like an idiot 
  when you say it wrong!”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“I 
  like <i>house</i> better. I like to pretend like you live in a house.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Well, 
  I don’t. It’s an apartment. Say it right from now on. Dammit.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Whenever 
  I come over to your <i>apartment</i>,” Megan corrected, “I can catch dust for 
  you!”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Yeah, 
  whatever.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Megan 
  paused for a second and bit her lip, thinking. Finally, she said, “Mom said 
  you’d take me to McDonald’s.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Her 
  dad laughed. Megan didn’t know what he thought was so funny. Nervous, she laughed 
  with him.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“It 
  doesn’t surprise me she’d say that.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“So, 
  will you?” Hope flashed in Megan’s eyes.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Her 
  dad scratched the stubble on his cheek. “Yeah, alright.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Megan 
  grinned and skipped to the door. </font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Wait! 
  I didn’t say we were going now! I got some pans over there that need washing.” 
  He pointed across the room to a few heavy-looking skillets that were piled among 
  tons of dishes in the metal sink of the kitchen. Megan took one look at the 
  skillets and groaned. &quot;Wash those first, and then we’ll go.&quot;</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Can’t 
  we just go now, and I’ll do them later?”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Hey, 
  if you want to sit there and argue with me, then we just won't go at all. How 
  do you like that?”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Megan 
  dragged herself to the kitchen and looked at the chore. The skillets were black 
  and slippery, sort of like a toad’s skin, only not quite, because the pieces 
  of meat and cheese that were baked onto it made it look more like Megan’s mom’s 
  casseroles. Megan cringed at the thought. She cleaned the skillets as quickly 
  as possible, her small toes supporting her weight. </font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“I’m 
  done!” she called after about five minutes of running the dish scrubber over 
  random parts of the skillets. “Can we go now?”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Her 
  dad heaved himself off the couch and went to the sink. He picked up one of the 
  drying skillets. Chunks of meat clung to the side. “Are you blind?”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“No.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“What 
  the hell is this?”</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Umm...”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Do 
  it over again, dammit. Stop being a damned moron. Wash them again, and if you 
  mess up this time, we’re not going to McDonald’s. <i>Got it</i>?”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">He 
  went back to the couch and stared at the wall. Megan picked up the scrubber 
  and &quot;accidentally&quot; dropped it as hard as she could. She picked it 
  up again and forced it against the skillet, making as much noise as possible. 
  Water sloshed around, and the skillet crashed against the sink a couple of times.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Hey! 
  Stop making all that noise, or we aren’t going anywhere! <i>Got</i> <i>it</i>?”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">That 
  shut Megan up. After a few minutes, Megan decided she was Cinderella. Megan 
  cleaned dishes, and so did Cinderella. Megan decided that she, the <i>true</i> 
  Cinderella, had been zapped out of the fairy tale. Now she was here in her dad’s 
  apartment, doing chores and waiting for her chance to go to the ball. Her mice 
  friends had also traveled with her to this new world. They were roaches now, 
  and on the sticky counter, they danced beside her. She smiled at them.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">At 
  least fifteen minutes passed. When she was finished, her arms were sore, and 
  her toes hurt. Her father, much more slowly than before, went to check the skillets. 
  They were clean. But the rest of the dishes weren’t.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Okay. 
  Now make me something to eat. Make me some peanut butter sandwiches or something,” 
  he said, plopping back down on the couch.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“But 
  I thought we were eating at McDonald’s!”</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“I 
  haven’t had breakfast yet, Megan. Now go make me something to eat!”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“But-“</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“If 
  you don’t fix me something to eat, I’ll <i>die</i>.” He sounded completely serious. 
  “I haven’t had anything to eat all day, and all I’m goddamn asking you to do 
  is make me something, so I won’t die. You don’t want me to die, do you?”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“No...” 
  Megan was scared. She turned and wiped tears away from her eyes. The thought 
  of her father’s dead body made her tremble. Her hands shook while she fixed 
  the sandwiches. “You wouldn’t really die, would you?”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“If 
  I went without food? Hell, yeah, I would die. You would, too.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Megan 
  didn't want to hear anymore. She pushed the thoughts of death away. She imagined 
  banishing them to a far-off land, like Grandma’s back yard, where Pebbles, Grandma’s 
  mean little terrier, would tear them to shreds. </font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Megan 
  brought the sandwiches to her father and waited while he ate, each bite chewed 
  slowly. Megan wanted to scream. Bored, she kicked at the chair, only to be told 
  to shut up. Forever eventually ended, and her father smacked the last piece 
  of sandwich, licked his fingers, and belched.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“<i>Now</i> 
  can we go to McDonald’s?” Megan asked.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Her 
  father smiled. “No.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Megan 
  groaned. “What do I have to do <i>now</i>?”</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Nothing. 
  We ain’t going.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Megan’s 
  body went numb. Her one sharp canine tooth bit down on her lower lip, and she 
  tasted blood. “But you <i>said</i>-“</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Nope. 
  You didn’t finish the dishes, like I told you to.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“I’ll 
  finish them!”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Nope.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“You 
  didn’t say I had to wash <i>all</i> the dishes! You said just the pans!”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Nope.”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“But 
  that’s not fair!” Megan screamed.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Her 
  dad laughed. “Life ain’t fair! Get used to it!”</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">He 
  stood up from the couch and went to his room. “Wake me up when your mom gets 
  here.”</font></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">*     
  *     *     *     *</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Megan’s 
  mom didn't return that day. She had to work late. That’s what she said, anyway. 
  Megan’s dad had gone to his room hours ago, and he left Megan to sleep on the 
  couch. She lay there for hours, bored and miserable, until she finally had enough. 
  She needed water.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">She 
  got up from the couch and carefully made her way through the darkness. She found 
  the edge of the kitchen counter and, stretching her arm as far as it would go, 
  opened the cabinet above. She knew a few cups were on the top shelf.  </font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Megan 
  lifted herself up and crawled onto the counter, then stood. Her heels peeled 
  away from the filthy counter as she stood on her toes and grabbed one of the 
  cups. Just as she was about to jump down, she felt something crawl onto her 
  foot. Startled, she lost her balance and fell to the hard tiled floor below.</font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Landing 
  on her side, Megan struggled to keep her cries inside as a few stubborn tears 
  ran down her face. “<i>Fuck</i>,” she whispered. </font></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">She 
  stood and limped over to the sink, got some water, and found her way back to 
  the couch.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
  pixies were fluttering all around her, she supposed. They were everywhere, but 
  they never caught her when she fell. She left a little water in the glass before 
  she set it down on the floor, a tiny part of her hoping some of the pixies might 
  land in it and drown. It wasn’t like they were alive anymore. To her the pixies 
  were nothing but dust settling in an old, shabby apartment.</font></p>
