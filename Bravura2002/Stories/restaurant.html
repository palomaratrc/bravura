  a glass of the house wine,” Peter said finishing his order and handing the waiter 
  his menu. The waiter bowed respectfully and went to inform the chef that Dr. 
  Johnson at table two wanted the usual. </span></font></p>

style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>While this was being done, Peter 
  stretched himself out and made himself comfortable. It would be at least half 
  an hour, maybe longer, until his food arrived. That, thought Peter, was the 
  only real disadvantage to eating here. The long wait. Everything else was fine. 
  The food was well prepared and tasted excellent, the staff was friendly, and 
  the atmosphere was great. Classical music played softly in the background. Beautiful 
  paintings of landscapes and portraits decorated the walls. It was almost the 
  perfect restaurant. Almost. That damn wait was the only downside. Still, he 
  could deal with it. It wasn’t an unreasonable amount of time considering the 
  quality of the food when it finally arrived. All he had to do was find some 
  way to pass the time.</span></font></p>
<p class=MsoTitle style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Peter 
  idly looked around the restaurant. It wasn’t as full as he’d have thought it 
  would be. Usually it was bustling around dinnertime. There were couples out 
  for a romantic evening; families celebrating birthdays, anniversaries and college 
  acceptances; lawyers, doctors and professors eating delicious food in a companionable 
  atmosphere before going home to lonely, empty houses. Not today though. There 
  were at least three empty tables, one of which was surrounded by a swarm of 
  waiters and busboys. None of the other tables had more than two people at them. 
  It was a slow day. Peter briefly wondered if his food might be ready sooner 
  because of it but decided not to raise his hopes too much.  </font></p>
<p class=MsoTitle style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span
style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>He sighed heavily. Well, he had 
  to wait; there was no getting around it. He decided to play some solitaire while 
  he waited but quickly discovered that he had left his cards at home. Or at the 
  office. Either way they weren’t in his jacket pocket. While he was looking for 
  them he noticed the couple at the next table.</span></font></p>
<p class=MsoTitle><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">*  *  *</font></p>
<p class=MsoTitle align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Actually 
  what he noticed was an old man in a dark blue suit and an attractive young woman 
  in a blue dress having an animated (and apparently enjoyable) conversation. 
  The old man had steel gray eyes and, to be honest, a face that looked like it 
  had been carved from granite with a dull hatchet. He looked familiar. Peter 
  briefly wondered if he might be a former athlete or a coach of some sort. There 
  was no denying that the old man had been quite muscular and well built at one 
  time. </span></font></p>
<p class=MsoTitle align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Had 
  Peter paid more attention to the evening news he would have recognized the old 
  man in the dark blue suit as Colonel Brennan Carnifex, a widower several times 
  over who had inherited several large estates from his dearly departed wives. 
  It could be said that the Colonel had made a profession out of being a widower. 
  It could be said but it rarely ever was. Carnifex didn’t like it and was very 
  vocal in expressing his feelings about things he didn’t like. At the moment 
  Colonel Carnifex was celebrating his latest inheritance (and acquittal) with 
  a magnum of champagne, a large Cuban cigar, and an attractive young woman. He 
  was well off financially, ready to settle down, and felt that this particular 
  young woman would make an excellent wife.</span></font></p>
<p class=MsoTitle align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Had 
  Peter been able to study the young woman in the blue dress in greater detail; 
  he would have recognized her as being a childhood friend of his. Had he done 
  so, he would have approached her and entered into conversation with her thereby 
  discovering that she worked as a professor of psychology at a university not 
  far from the hospital where he worked as a cardiologist. In the short term this 
  would have led to a flood of verbal abuse from the retired Colonel and Peter’s 
  quick retreat to his own table. It would also have led to a telephone call from 
  his childhood friend, the young woman in the blue dress, two days later. She 
  would call Peter to apologize for Carnifex’s loathsome behavior. This, in turn, 
  would result in Peter taking his childhood friend out to dinner at the restaurant. 
  This would eventually have led to a relationship that would end fifty-some years 
  later with his falling from the roof of their house in Florida, after stubbornly 
  refusing to let their son-in-law hang up the Christmas lights. </span></font></p>
<p class=MsoTitle align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Peter, 
  however, was not able to study the young woman in any greater detail. By chance, 
  the young woman in the blue dress was sitting with her back to him. Instead 
  he focused his attention back on the old man in the dark blue suit and tried 
  to remember where he had seen him.</span></font></p>
<p class=MsoTitle align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Had 
  Peter – in his professional capacity as Dr. Johnson – been Carnifex’s doctor 
  he would have known that the Colonel’s love of the good life (especially good 
  food, good cigars and good wines) had weakened his cold-blooded heart to the 
  degree that his wife-to-be would be his widow a few hours after the wedding. 
  A very wealthy widow. </span></font></p>
<p class=MsoTitle align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Had 
  Peter also known exactly how ill gotten the Colonel’s wealth was, he wouldn’t 
  have done a thing to save him.</span></font></p>
<p class=MsoTitle align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">But Peter 
  Johnson knew none of these things. He simply wrote off the old man in the dark 
  blue suit as being a dirty old man and his attractive companion in the blue 
  dress as a gold-digger and looked around to find other interesting diners in 
  the restaurant worth studying.  </font></p>

  next table was one of the empty ones. In fact, this was the table that all those 
  waiters and busboys had been working on. Peter became aware of a sudden need 
  to use the restroom. So, he stood up, flexed a cramp out of his left calf, and 
  walked to the restroom. On the way back, Peter took advantage of the opportunity 
  to stop by and take a quick look at the table.</span></font></p>

  </span>Today was the 35<sup>th</sup> Wedding Anniversary of Victor and Victoria 
  Noble. Unknown to the couple, their two children and their spouses had conspired 
  to surprise them with a dinner here at the couple’s favorite restaurant. The 
  plotters had spared no expense in order to ensure a happy and memorable evening. 
  </font></p>
<p class=MsoTitle align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            
  </span>Unfortunately for the conspirators and the restaurant staff, the couple 
  that was to be surprised had spontaneously decided to take off on a second honeymoon. 
  That evening, when their children and their spouses arrived to take them to 
  the restaurant, they were nowhere to be found. Immediately, the panicky plotters 
  called everyone they could think of. They called the Nobles’ friends and neighbors. 
  Finally they called the police. They forgot to call the restaurant. As a result, 
  the management would hold the food and the table until closing time, at which 
  point the decision would be made to bill the conspirators for wasting the restaurants 
  time and food.</font></p>
<p class=MsoTitle align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:200%'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><span>            
  </span>Meanwhile, the police and the Nobles’ children and children-in-law would 
  search for the missing couple for three and a half hours before locating them 
  in the Hotel L’Affaire in Palm Village. At the time of their discovery they 
  were busily doing their best to recreate their honeymoon. As a result they failed 
  to notice the knocking on the door of their hotel room. Concerned by their failure 
  to answer the knocking their son-in-law would jump through the window of the 
  hotel room in a heroic, if severely misguided, attempt to rescue them from danger. 
  The embarrassment of the situation resulted in a noteworthy increase in tension 
  between the parents and their children and an end to surprise celebrations in 
  the family for several years to come.</font></p>

  table following the Nobleses was empty but the one after that had a single diner, 
  a middle-aged woman wearing a gray dress and coat with a tattered valise and 
  a copy of <i>The Daily Spyglass</i> on the floor by her feet. Peter couldn’t 
  believe that she read such trash. She had a very prim and proper look to her 
  as she sipped at her soup and tea. Soup and tea. She was probably the governess 
  for a wealthy family, Peter thought. He glanced at his watch; the food would

  known who she was, he might have lost his appetite. The woman he had casually 
  dismissed as being a prim and proper governess was actually Martina Wright, 
  a journalist whose articles in <i>The Daily Spyglass</i> Peter always read and 
  utterly loathed. He couldn’t understand it; her articles were, almost without 
  exception, extremist one-sided rants that cursed and, in some cases actually 
  threatened violence against, dissenting opinions in language unbefitting a journalist.  
  She called it “subjective journalism,” while Peter called it (he thought, more 
  accurately) “propaganda”. She was a two-bit, backwater, inferior journalist 
  who would never amount to anything and yet he couldn’t help reading her articles. 
  In some sick, unhealthy way those articles fascinated him. Maybe it was the 
  same phenomena that made people slow down to gawk at carnage of an auto accident.

  the ultimate story. There she would discover that Powers was having an affair 
  with a tall blonde wearing a revolting green dress or, as she would write in 
  the article revealing Powers’ indiscretion, “a hideous dress the color of radioactive 
  guacamole.” As a result of her article, Powers would lose his bid for Governor 
  in the upcoming election, and his wife would divorce him. Furthermore, Wright’s 
  article would spark an official investigation into his activities, after which 
  Jackson Powers would be arrested, tried, and convicted for misusing the power 
  of his political office. His former business partner would (after taking over 
  the company) disavow any association with Powers or his unscrupulous business 
  practices. After serving three of his five years in a minimum-security prison, 
  Jackson Powers would be paroled on good behavior. Once out, he would use his 
  few remaining contacts in the business world to start a new business. In a few 
  years he would become a minor celebrity in his community as “Jumping Jack” Powers 
  of Powers Used Cars (“I’ll jump through hoops to make sure you get the best 
  deal on a used car”). Fortunately, the basic principles of his new job weren’t 
  that far from the basic principles of his old one and he was able to earn enough 
  to keep his head above the water, financially speaking, until his death of a 
  heart attack thirteen years later.</span></font></p>
