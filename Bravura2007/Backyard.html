        <h1>Look at Me and My Backyard Go By</h1>
        <p>Michael Burge</p>
        <p>I  was lying on my bed that afternoon, killing a bunch of these tiny black and  white beetles crawling up my window, feeling air blow from the ceiling fan,  when I heard the train coming. The window shook like usual but then I heard the  train screech and the cars bang up against each other. When I looked out the  back door I saw the Amtrak had stopped past my house and Amy&rsquo;s house. <br />
          I  knew what had happened. It was Amy&rsquo;s brother. It was going to happen and now it  finally had. I knew that somewhere beyond the rusty piles of sinks and  bathtubs, skeleton cars and bent chain link fence, satellite dishes and beer  bottle glass, he was lying dead in the dirt.</p>
        <p>Spencer  was her brother&rsquo;s name and he was retarded so I felt bad for Amy having to take  care of him. Her mom didn&rsquo;t do it because my mom said she was a shit-crazy  drug-whore. <br />
          Trying  to be Spencer&rsquo;s friend was impossible. He was always out by the tracks alone so  I went out there once but he could hardly talk. I was eating one of those Otter  Pops, the red kind I think, and when I was done with it I threw the wrapper on  the ground and he got mad and told me to pick it up but I didn&rsquo;t so he picked  it up and tried to hand it to me but I just left. <br />
          Another  time I pulled my pants down and mooned a freight train to try to be funny but  he said no, and pushed me and told me not to do it or else. Or else what, I  said. He turned away, mumbling something. All he could do was squat on the  tracks and watch the train disappear.<br />
          Every  day he was out by the tracks. He liked to put coins on them right before a  train came &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know why. He&rsquo;d watch the train rumble over them and then  after it passed he&rsquo;d look for the ones that fell into the grimy dirt. <br />
          I  used to find some of them once in a while, the ones he forgot or just left.  They&rsquo;d be flat like Fruit Rollups and sometimes the faces on them would be  completely gone and sometimes they&rsquo;d be only half gone and you&rsquo;d see their  heads like they were comics that had been pressed onto Silly Putty and then  pulled. I put a nickel on the track once but what&rsquo;s the point, all it did was  make the nickel worthless.<br />
          Sometimes  I&rsquo;d find dead coyotes or jackrabbits lying by the tracks. You&rsquo;d think in this  entire big desert and at the few quick times the trains came through animals  wouldn&rsquo;t try to cross. But they did and when they did they&rsquo;d rot out there  under the sun forever and parts of the bodies would go missing and I&rsquo;d think,  vultures, but there&rsquo;d be shoe prints around the body and vultures don&rsquo;t wear  sneakers or cut paws off.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
          The  bugs were driving me crazy. The heat made it worse. My boxers were sticking to  me so I took them off and just wore shorts &ndash; commando. I&rsquo;d keep the windows  open but there was no breeze. The air in the house was the same as the air  outside. <br />
          I  could always tell it was summer when the beetles started coming into the house  from nowhere. There&rsquo;d be so many of them. They&rsquo;d crawl on the yellow stucco  wall and up the window next to my bed. Sometimes they&rsquo;d be in my bed, on me, crawling  through my arm hair. They looked like tiny drips from a cookies and cream  Blizzard from Dairy Queen, only they had legs thinner than hair and they  crunched when you squished them under your thumbnail. </p>
        <p>One  time Amy told me her mom&rsquo;s mind was fucked up. I looked up at her. She was  taller than me and a year older and always wore dirty rubber shoes that used to  be clear but turned yellow and small dresses with black spandex shorts  underneath.<br />
          Oh,  I said. Yeah, she said, she was born that way just like my little brother and  there&rsquo;s nothin to do about it. I said, why don&rsquo;t you take her to a doctor, and  she looked at me angry and told me her mom didn&rsquo;t want to go and they were fine  and there wasn&rsquo;t nothin they could do.<br />
          Sometimes  I&rsquo;d be outside at night crouching behind the rusty brown Mercury Cougar tilted  where our property line met theirs and her mom looked normal to me, standing in  her backyard watching the sky. I&rsquo;d watch her hand, two of her fingers squeezing  the end of a cigarette, the orange tip like what I imagined a firefly looked  like at night. <br />
          But  then during the day I&rsquo;d hear the TV turned up loud from inside their house and  then turned down again so you couldn&rsquo;t hear it and then back up and she&rsquo;d yell  stuff I couldn&rsquo;t understand and that&rsquo;s when Spencer would be out by the tracks.</p>
        <p>The  trains went faster at night. I&rsquo;d listen to them in my bed and they&rsquo;d rattle my  walls. The window shook and the ground vibrated up into my bed and I almost  wanted to laugh when I felt the engine roll through me like a dust devil.  Sometimes the horn blew and I&rsquo;d clutch my blanket and close my eyes and I&rsquo;d be  carried with the train. The house shook harder and it felt like the whole world  was going to crack.<br />
          Then  I&rsquo;d hear my mom scream <em>goddamit!</em> from  her bedroom because she doesn&rsquo;t like it when they blow the horn because she  says there&rsquo;s no reason to do it especially at two o&rsquo;clock in the fucking  morning.</p>
        <p>A  few days ago Amy was over at my house and we were looking at pictures in a  magazine I&rsquo;d found in my mom&rsquo;s room called <em>Better  Homes and Gardens</em>. We were leaning back on my bed and I could smell the air  puffing from her &ndash; hair oil, dried spit, deodorant like baby powder &ndash; and her  house smells &ndash; cigarettes, alcohol, cat piss. I wished only her smells were on  her. I was going to ask her if she wanted to watch a movie when Spencer banged  on the back screen door and called her name. <br />
          What&rsquo;s  he doing in my backyard, I said, and she got up to let him in and I said, no,  he can&rsquo;t come in, my mom&rsquo;s not home, and she said, well <em>I&rsquo;m</em> here, and I said, yeah but, fine. <br />
          As  we walked back to my room I heard Spencer&rsquo;s wet nasally breathing behind me and  felt his eyes going all over my school photographs on the dark hallway wall.<br />
          Amy  didn&rsquo;t say anything to him and he didn&rsquo;t say anything to her and I told him he  could sit on the ground if he wanted to. He sat right in the doorway and picked  at the paint chipping on the doorframe. I watched his head roll around and his  stupid eyes roll over everything I owned, things that only I knew the history  behind and where they came from. A bunch of hairs like weeds sat underneath his  oily nose. He smelled like he hadn&rsquo;t had a shower in weeks and the lines in his  palms were filled with dirt made into mud from his sweat. I had to tell him to  stop picking at the paint when he started making a huge pile that looked like  big flakes of dandruff on the carpet. He just sat there, doing nothing but  looking. It drove me crazy.<br />
          When  they finally left, after Spencer had slobbered up the rest of my Kool-Aid, I  went back to my room and looked at everything as if I&rsquo;d be able to see the  germs crawling over my stuff like the black and white beetles. Everything was  there except my penny. The penny I&rsquo;d gotten on my first and only trip to  Disneyland.<br />
          I  described to Amy the next day what my penny looked like and that it was on my  dresser and that it was missing and she said, so, and I said, I think maybe  Spencer might have taken it, and she said, why the fuck would he take a penny,  and I said, it has a picture of Splash Mountain on it, and she said, he has his  own pennies, and I said, I know, and she said, why would he take a fuckin  squished penny when he&rsquo;s got his own, and I said, I don&rsquo;t know. <br />
          That  penny was the only piece of evidence I had that I&rsquo;d been somewhere besides here.  He had no right to steal it, just because he was retarded. I paid fifty cents  and a penny for that penny. It was smoothed out and had a picture on it and I  had watched the tiny silver gears turn in the glass box that it was made in so  it had been worth it and now it&rsquo;s gone.</p>
        <p>I  hadn&rsquo;t been outside all day because it was so hot. The TV was on in the living  room but I wasn&rsquo;t watching it, nobody was. I was looking at the flattened  beetles on my thumbnail, thinking about turning the air conditioning on although  my mom had said it was too damn expensive to run it, when the train came and  hit Spencer.<br />
          I  got up from my bed, walked down the hallway into the kitchen and looked out the  back door. I could hear pounding in my chest go up into my head.<br />
          The  sun was bright. For a second I had to close my eyes. Other neighbors came  running out of their houses and Amy peered out her back door. She looked over  at me as if I had the answer, which I did, but she had to see for herself. So  she ran all the way to the front of the train, a two-story sleeper train,  bright silver with red and white stripes and one big blue stripe along the  sides of the cars. She must have thought the train had stopped quick like a car  or something. But Spencer was lying far behind it by their backyard.<br />
  &nbsp;I walked so slowly to the tracks, thinking,  I&rsquo;m not supposed to be doing this, I don&rsquo;t want to look, but I did. <br />
          It  wasn&rsquo;t Spencer anymore. I turned and felt acid food come into my throat but I  swallowed it as everyone came running and Amy came and screamed and a neighbor  pushed me away and told me to go home.<br />
          I  sat down by a pile of brown hubcaps, feeling dizzy in the heat, and watched  them circle around the body. It felt like my eyes were spinning and I couldn&rsquo;t  really focus on anything. People in black pants and jackets were jumping from  the open doorways on the train and talking into crackling radios. It was weird  to see all those people out there when usually no one was ever out there except  Spencer.<br />
          I  looked to Amy&rsquo;s house and the mother was jogging towards the circle of people.  I thought, Amy, you better stop her, but Amy was screaming and looked like  jelly in a man&rsquo;s arms so the mother in her orange sweat pants like deflated  balloons ran and nobody stopped her and she screamed. She pushed her way to the  body and grabbed it and blood went everywhere on her white shirt and her orange  pants. She hugged it and screamed and rubbed its head and threw up all over it  kept screaming.<br />
          Right  before they pulled her away she picked something off the ground and held it up.<br />
  &nbsp;&ldquo;My baby - look what he did,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Look  what my baby did for me.&rdquo; A man and a woman led her past me and I saw it  glimmer in the sun between her fingers. My penny - the picture of Splash  Mountain dark on its flat surface. <br />
  &ldquo;He  made this for me,&rdquo; she wailed through runny snot and chunks of vomit dripping  from her mouth, her hair crazy on her head like burnt wires. <br />
          By  the time the firefighters and the ambulance came I was able to feel my legs  again so I stood up and walked past all the backyards towards the train. I  walked away from it and the people standing in the open doors didn&rsquo;t see me or  didn&rsquo;t care when I got closer to it. <br />
          I  had never been so close to a train when it was still. The sun reflecting off  its hot clean metallic surface made me squint. I walked to one of the cars that  said <em>Sleeping Car</em> on the side below  the dark second-story windows high above me. I felt the heat heaving from the  silver wheels. I could reach the first story windows on my toes but I could  barely see through them because they were tinted so I framed my eyes with my  hands against one of them. A face stared back at me, pale but dark through the  glass. I jumped back. I felt mad for some reason but what did I expect to find  in there? <br />
          The  wind picked up and blew dust against the train and in my eyes. One of those  cookies and cream beetles landed on the window where the face had been. <br />
          Two  hands and the pale face pressed against the window again, squinting in the sun,  looking down at me. It was a kid&rsquo;s face, younger than me, and it was saying  something. I hated looking up at that stupid face, not knowing what it was  saying in there. Why&rsquo;d they have to look at us like that? Why&rsquo;d they have to  sit there in those windows and look over everyone&rsquo;s houses and everyone&rsquo;s yards  and me and probably think mean thoughts about me? <br />
          The  beetle crawled over the face and I rushed forward and heard my fist pound  against the glass. The face disappeared. I would have done it even if the  beetle hadn&rsquo;t been there, I felt so hot inside. I wiped the dead bug from the  side of my palm on my pants and one of those train people in black walked up to  me and told me to stand back from the train, son. He pointed at the houses  behind me and told me to go home. <br />
          I  looked into the open door he had come through. Other stewards and passengers  were piled up watching me. Their heads were bobbing around like gophers poking  out from their holes. They turned back to the clump of people far down on the  tracks. Angry words came to my mouth. I wanted to say, <em>fuck all you fuckers</em>, but I just stood there and kicked dust into  the air.<br />
          For  a second I could feel myself jumping through the door and running past them  through thin hallways where I&rsquo;d hide in the cool dark that I imagined grew from  inside the cars. <br />
          But  their ugly faces stopped it. I turned around and walked back towards my house.  For the rest of the day I watched the firefighters and the ambulance and police  and Amy and news cameras and later, when they were all gone, when the sun was  down, nothing but the empty desert.</p>
