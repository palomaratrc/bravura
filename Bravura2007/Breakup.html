      <h1>Breakup</h1>
      <p>Cassie Larreta</p>
      <p>He  was angry.&nbsp; <br />
        She  was furious.<br />
        She  had the right to be; getting yelled at for having dinner with a friend on her  last night in town.&nbsp; They would still  hang out, why was he so mad? She said, &ldquo;Sometime after work we can hang out, I get  off at six.&rdquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not like she meant  directly at six.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t  apologize.&nbsp; She yelled back.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t call her to tell her he couldn&rsquo;t  hang out today.&nbsp; <br />
        She  screamed.&nbsp; <br />
        She  yelled.&nbsp; <br />
        She  cussed.&nbsp; <br />
        She  meant almost every word of it.&nbsp; Then it hit her.<br />
        She  wasn&rsquo;t happy <em>anymore</em>.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She loved him, but had fallen out of love.&nbsp; It was hard.&nbsp;  She wanted with all her might to be set free, she felt like a caged  animal.&nbsp; She made a pro and con  list.&nbsp; Shit.&nbsp; The cons out weighed the pros.&nbsp; What to do now.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d never forgive herself for letting him  go.&nbsp; She had wanted to marry him; the  idea lingered but was gone.<br />
        Pro: he was  caring and compassionate&hellip;<br />
        Con:<strong> </strong>when he  wanted to be<br />
        Pro: he was a  good person&hellip;<br />
        Con: when not  accusing her of anything and everything<br />
        Con: he always  wanted her to please him and rarely pleased her<br />
        Con: if she  didn&rsquo;t call on all three of her work breaks she was accused of flirting with  boys<br />
        Con: he was  the most paranoid person she knew and extremely needy<br />
        Pro:<strong> </strong><em>he loved her</em> <br />
        Five cons&hellip;three pros<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are more.&nbsp; She just doesn&rsquo;t want to think about it  anymore.</p>
      <p>He was online.<br />
        No, not <em>him</em>.&nbsp; The boy she&rsquo;s wanted since high school,  Paxton.&nbsp; Their past was rocky; he liked  her when she didn&rsquo;t like him, she wanted him when he didn&rsquo;t want her.&nbsp; Just once, they were on the same page.&nbsp; Neither of them did a thing, they gave  up.&nbsp; Stupid.&nbsp; They talked online that night for hours.&nbsp; She still wanted him, but did he want her?</p>
      Paxton: This is awkward, you have a boyfriend, but if you didn&rsquo;t&hellip;That&rsquo;s a different case
      <p>We  always talk about this online, he said.&nbsp;  It was decided.&nbsp; They would talk  in person, tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Her  mind, frazzled.&nbsp; <br />
        She  spoke with her friend, Jessica.&nbsp; Jessica  agreed that it appeared she hadn&rsquo;t been happy for months.&nbsp; There was only one thing to do.&nbsp; Oh god, she didn&rsquo;t want to.&nbsp; To take a break?&nbsp; It seemed like such an ending.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t want to end it, she still loved  him.&nbsp; But she didn&rsquo;t think she was happy  anymore.</p>
      <p>He  came over.</p>
      It was  7:30pm
      <p>It  was all so awkward, he lay stiffly on the bed next to her.&nbsp; She could feel the words waiting to roll off  her tongue, she resisted.&nbsp; Did she really  want this?<br />
        They  burned a hole inside her mouth, <br />
        She  couldn&rsquo;t take the pain anymore.<br />
        The  words came spewing out like hot vomit,<br />
        Choking  her.<br />
        With  every word she said,<br />
        The  more intense the burn.<br />
        Their  eyes slowly traveled upward as she finished.&nbsp; <br />
        Her  eyes met his, with every second that passed his beautiful eyes of ocean blue  shifted to red as if blood was filling the ocean.&nbsp; <br />
        She  had made the ocean overflow.<br />
        He was crying.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had just broken his heart.&nbsp; Now he was breaking hers.<br />
        This  was all her fault, but she hadn&rsquo;t meant for anything to happen.&nbsp; She told him the truth because it was eating  her up; well almost the whole truth. </p>
      <p>Her  version, for him:<br />
        Paxton  saw her in the parking lot.<br />
        She  was called over to talk.<br />
        They  hadn&rsquo;t talked to each other in awhile.<br />
        Out  of nowhere, he kissed her.<br />
        She  pulled back and left.</p>
      <p>The  real version:<br />
        Paxton  saw her in the parking lot.<br />
        She  was called over to talk.<br />
        They  talked last night.<br />
        They  had become friends with benefits.<br />
        They  went to his car.<br />
        He  kissed her.<br />
        She  didn&rsquo;t stop him.<br />
        Nor  did she enjoy it.<br />
        She  said, &ldquo;see ya,&rdquo; and left</p>
      <p>She  couldn&rsquo;t tell him that much, he would die.&nbsp;  And so would she.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>It  had been three days since he last spoke to her.<br />
        To  break up or not to break up&hellip;that is the question. </p>
      <p>They  were sitting so uneasily on the couch.&nbsp;  She was holding back, if she said anything it would come out  defensively.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t want to add  anymore to the ordeal.<br />
        He spoke.<br />
        There  lay a half hour between every heart breaking word that fell from his lips.</p>
      <p>Would he end their eighteen month relationship over one stupid <em>mistake</em>?<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sighed with relief. <br />
        He  wouldn&rsquo;t end it.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t, he said.</p>
      <p>Their  love was to strong.&nbsp; Thank God.&nbsp; The weeks following were rocky.&nbsp; She had to hold back the frustration he  created in her when he questioned her.&nbsp;  She knew she&rsquo;d have to live with it.&nbsp;  It was, after all, her fault the paranoia was at its worst.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It had  been a week, he still wouldn&rsquo;t kiss her.&nbsp;  He&rsquo;d kiss her once right before he returned home.&nbsp; Anytime she asked, or attempted to kiss  him&hellip;he&rsquo;d turn away, ignoring her cries for much needed passion.<br />
        Damn  her.&nbsp; Damn.<strong>&nbsp; </strong><em>Damn.</em><br />
        She  hated herself more then ever now.</p>
