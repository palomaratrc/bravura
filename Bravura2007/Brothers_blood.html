        <h1><strong>My Brother&rsquo;s Blood  Machine</strong></h1><br />
          Matt Carlin
        <p align="center"><u>Part  1:&nbsp; The Sound I Wake Up To</u><br />
          {CATHUK-A-CATHUK-A-CATHUK-A-CATHUK-A-CATHUK-A-CATHUK-A--}<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before  I realized it, I was lost in the sound.&nbsp;  The speed bag thumping over and over against the plywood backboard was a  melodious sound.&nbsp; There was a week left  before my fight with the Champion, and I had a long way to go before I&rsquo;d be  ready.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Physically,  I could throw down with Moses any day of the week, but mentally&hellip;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  stopped punching to grab a drink of water and a new sound permeated the room  immediately.&nbsp; It was a kind of whirring, beeping,  clicking sound, and I couldn&rsquo;t begin punching again soon enough, trying to  block out the din.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My  brother&rsquo;s blood machine was both a blessing and a curse.&nbsp; Our father was in prison for dealing drugs to  provide funding for the massive machine and our mother had died a long time before;  but it was the only thing that kept him alive.&nbsp;  Back then it was just me and him; and that sound blaring all day, every  day.<br />
          {CLICK--BEEP--WHIRR--CLICK--BEEP--WHIRR--CLICK--BEEP--WHIRR--}<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  couldn&rsquo;t keep the rhythm, so I left the speed bag swinging softly, trying to  get its bearings after the beating I&rsquo;d given it.&nbsp; I opened my bedroom door and peered out to  see my brother sleeping on our couch, which was surrounded by myriad piles of  clothing and empty milk cartons, and boxes of Lucky Charms that had had all the  marshmallow pieces removed.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  contemplated sneaking over and flipping the switch; pulling the plug.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  made my way as quietly as possible over to where he lay, dodging empty pizza  boxes and bowls filled with milk congealing into cottage cheese.&nbsp; Standing over him, I watched as his frail  chest heaved laboriously in time with the sounds of the <em>CellSaver</em>.&nbsp; My hand stretched  over his sleeping form, reaching for the glowing red demon&rsquo;s eye of a power  button.&nbsp; It would have been for the best,  it would have been a mercy to the suffering he had endured&hellip;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But  then my brother moaned in his sleep.&nbsp; It  was the most pathetic sound I&rsquo;d ever heard, and instead of pressing the button  I walked into the bathroom and snatched his bottle of medicine from the  countertop.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wake  up Johnathon,&rdquo; I said as I nudged him awake and handed him a glass of water and  two of the pills.&nbsp; He groaned as he drank  the water first and downed the pills dry afterward.&nbsp; &ldquo;What the hell is wrong with you?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re doing it in the wrong order, you  know.&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Arthur,  don&rsquo;t tell me how to take my pills.&nbsp; How  long have I been taking them?&nbsp; Seven  years?&nbsp; I know how to fucking do it.&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  thought of socking him on the arm, but the needles and tubes protruding from  his frail limb dissuaded me.&nbsp; I had been  robbed of many brotherly activities such as wrestling and play-fighting and  rough-housing by my brother&rsquo;s cancer.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re  not old enough to say fuck.&nbsp; When you&rsquo;re  eighteen, maybe, but not before then, now shove over,&rdquo; I said as I snagged the  remote from the table and turned on the television.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;If  I live that long,&rdquo; he mumbled as he moved delicately over to the other side of  the couch.&nbsp; The sound of the <em>CellSaver</em> began to annoy me even  further, and I wished that the television&rsquo;s remote had the ability to alleviate  the depressing racket.<br />
          My brother and I  were opposite in every way.&nbsp; I had dark,  thick hair, while his was light blonde, nearly white, and scraggly from the  chemo.&nbsp; My eyes were light hazel, and his  were dark brown; and while he was as fragile as a porcelain doll, I was an  underground prize fighter, the top in the region, and I had a match with the Champion  coming up in a week.<br />
          I turned the  volume up as loud as it would go, but the sound of the blood machine was always  there in the back of my mind.&nbsp; I hated  that fucking sound.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most  people would have told me to tune it out or something.&nbsp; Then again, most people have never had to  live with something like that in their house.&nbsp;  It was like a washing machine that has a heavy, thunderous thumping  sound, or a furnace that roars like a lion in the middle of the night.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It  was one of those things that just cannot be ignored.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Johnathon  pinched my arm to get my attention and then signaled for me to turn the volume  down.&nbsp; I ignored him and turned my  attention to the channels I was flipping though aimlessly.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  realized as I settled on &ldquo;The Price Is Right&rdquo; that something felt odd about the  couch.&nbsp; It was as if I was sitting on a  lump of sand or something, and I stood up to investigate the situation after a  few moments of continually shifting my weight to no avail.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What  I saw that day was something perplexingly simple, but profoundly devastating to  my grasp on my brother&rsquo;s situation.&nbsp; I  had been sitting on a groove in the couch that had been perfectly molded by my  brother&rsquo;s sleeping form.&nbsp; I could clearly  see the outline of the side of his body, accompanied by a mould of his right  arm curled up next to the outline of his torso.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  had never taken the time to contemplate the amount of time my brother had spent  on that couch in our dingy apartment.&nbsp; Every  hour of every day, except when I had to give him sponge baths, which found him  on the floor rather than the couch.&nbsp;  Johnathon had been relegated indefinitely to the puke-green piece of  furniture in what must have been the dirtiest apartment in the world.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glancing  frantically at the tubing connecting my brother to his monstrous anchor, I  became sick to my stomach.&nbsp; I thought  again of tearing the cord from the machine, of flipping the switch, but this  only made me more queasy.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  gathered my coat and stormed out of the apartment shortly after my discovery.<br />
  <u>Part  Two:&nbsp; The Going Price for Home</u><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;So  your fight is tonight?&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo;  I said, flicking aside the cigarette I had been smoking.&nbsp; I was unnerved.&nbsp; The bills for the <em>CellSaver </em>were almost due, and I had to win this fight.&nbsp; Everything was riding on how I fared against  the Champ.&nbsp; The constant racket wasn&rsquo;t  helping either.&nbsp; Sighing, I said &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  tough being a prize fighter, Johnny.&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t believe it,  but he actually felt that he was to blame for the way things had turned out.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  beat yourself up for something that&rsquo;s not your fault.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not like I have any other choice.&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;But  you do.&nbsp; You do, Arthur.&nbsp; You could go back to work down at the docks,  at the grocery store, at the fucking mall.&nbsp;  You don&rsquo;t have to fight.&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He  had a valid point.&nbsp; I suppose didn&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to fight.&nbsp; I had worked the docks in the years before  our father had been convicted, but&hellip;&ldquo;None of those jobs provide the kind of  money we need.&nbsp; Maybe if dad were here,  maybe if somebody else could share the&hellip;&rdquo; I hesitated a few seconds before  continuing, &ldquo;&hellip;share the burden.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s  nobody else.&nbsp; Just you and me; and  boxing&rsquo;s the only thing that I&rsquo;m good enough at to make a living on.&nbsp; I mean, think of it this way: &nbsp;at my level I get more money from one fight  than I would get in a month working any of those other jobs.&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Johnathon  scoffed, &ldquo;Sure, you probably like kicking the shit out of people for a  living.&nbsp; Probably makes you feel real  good about yourself.&nbsp; What if you ever  killed somebody in the ring?&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t  you feel bad about that?&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  contemplated his statements for a few moments.&nbsp;  Whatever I got out of fighting, it sure as hell wasn&rsquo;t pleasure.&nbsp; Boxing was something I was good at, to be  sure, but I would never go so far as to admit that I enjoyed it.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I like it.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a real danger every time you step in the  ring.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s either you, or him, and both  of your lives are literally on the line.&nbsp;  I suppose that if I ever killed somebody in the ring that I&rsquo;d be fine  with it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d feel bad, of course, but  it&rsquo;s understood that boxers gamble not only with money, but with their lives.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an all or nothing deal.&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Johnathon  turned sullenly away from me after making a loud choking sound.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s  wrong?&rdquo; I said, lighting up again.&nbsp; It  was my last cigarette.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Johnathon  fondled the tubing connected to his veins.&nbsp;  It was the kind of fondling that a psycho killer in the movies gives to  his victims before killing them.&nbsp; &ldquo;How is  it possible for a person to even think that way?&nbsp; How can you be so cold?&rdquo;&nbsp; Before I could answer, he continued on,  steamrolling over my reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish you  didn&rsquo;t have to fight for me.&nbsp; I wish I  could support myself.&nbsp; I wish I could do  something by myself without this stupid fucking machine!&rdquo;&nbsp; His words quickly became frantic as he  finished, &ldquo;I wish that things could have turned out differently for us&hellip;for me.&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who  says I have to fight for you?&nbsp; Maybe I  choose to fight for you.&nbsp; Did you ever  think of that?&rdquo;&nbsp; I realized that I was  nearly screaming at him and brought myself down to a manageable level of  calm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come on, this is what brothers do  for each other, or didn&rsquo;t you know?&nbsp; And  don&rsquo;t say fuck!&rdquo;&nbsp; I raised my hand to  clap him on the shoulder, but let it drop as I realized that I probably  shouldn&rsquo;t. <br />
  &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a price I pay gladly,&rdquo; I said, more  gravely than I had intended.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A  smile slowly spread across his face and he hugged me lightly.&nbsp; He was probably putting all of his effort  into the hug, and I put my own arms around him, but he felt like a paper doll  that would crumple if I applied too much pressure.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I  just&hellip;I just want to sleep in my own bed for once.&nbsp; I just want things to go back to the way they  were before&hellip;I want a good night&rsquo;s sleep before I die.&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  so sorry, Johnny.&nbsp; I wish it were me  instead of you,&rdquo; I replied, but of course, I didn&rsquo;t mean it.&nbsp; I wanted no part of what he was going through.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <em>CellSaver</em> provided an awkward  soundtrack for the moment, and guiltily I remembered how easy it would be fore  me to turn off that stupid fucking machine. &nbsp;But I could never have brought myself to do  it.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later,  after several minutes of brotherly embrace (the first real contact we had had  in a long while, in fact), I stood and headed out to the fight.&nbsp; I was looking forward to leaving the clangor  of the blood machine behind.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  worry about me,&rdquo; were my last words to him before I left.<br />
  <u>Part  Three:&nbsp; The Fight of Moses Early &amp;  Sir Arthur McCloud</u><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s  a monstrous black bear sitting on a stool at the other side of the ring.&nbsp; Most boxers warm up with some shadow boxing  when they first get into the ring, but Moses Early is the Champion, and he doesn&rsquo;t  need any warm-up.&nbsp; He knows in his mind&rsquo;s  eye that he&rsquo;s got me, but I know in my mind&rsquo;s eye that I&rsquo;ve got him.<br />
  <em>This is it,</em> is the only thought I have  time to think before the bell rings and I&rsquo;m thrown into the maelstrom.&nbsp; Moses Early outweighs me by fifteen pounds,  but there are no regulations in underground bouts.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s  a thunderstorm in the ring.&nbsp; Most people  think you can&rsquo;t be struck by thunder, but until you step in the ring, you don&rsquo;t  know shit about thunder.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moses&rsquo;  fists are the storm clouds and lightning strikes every time he lands a  blow.&nbsp; Most people think lightning  doesn&rsquo;t strike the same place twice, but my face begs to differ.&nbsp; Static electricity is flowing through my  veins.&nbsp; Rain-like runnels of sweat are  flowing down my face, into my eyes, into my wounds, stinging and wakening me to  new pain with every moment.&nbsp; I am a  pillar of agony, but I have to win this fight.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  announcer is babbling incoherently to the crowd, telling them what they&rsquo;re  seeing because they&rsquo;re too enthralled by the possibility of my death to take in  all the information under their own power.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It  isn&rsquo;t what you would call a one sided fight.&nbsp;  I land a few punches here and there, the speed bag having gifted me with  the promise its name gives.&nbsp; I can see  after the first round that I&rsquo;ve blackened the area around Moses&rsquo; right eye.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  bell rings once again, beginning the second round, and it reminds me of the  sound I have heard for the past seven years.&nbsp; <br />
          {CLICK--BEEP--WHIRR--}<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It  fills me with a fervor I have never felt before.&nbsp; <em>My  brother needs his blood, and I&rsquo;ll bring him blood; machine or no.</em>&nbsp; This is the thought that flows through my  mind as I unleash my own thunderstorm on Moses Early&rsquo;s face and stomach.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right,  left, left, right.&nbsp; Jabs, uppercuts,  hooks and roundhouses.&nbsp; Blood, sweat, and  quite possibly tears.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;s  reaped the whirlwind, though not of his own accord.&nbsp; I strike like lightning again and again and  again, drawing forth blood with each blow.&nbsp;  Something flies into the ring, apparently caught in the tornado.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s  a towel, and in the eye of the storm my hand is lofted above my head by the  referee.&nbsp; Old Wayne Andrews, my manager,  and the town&rsquo;s bee keeper rushes into the ring and hugs me like a brother.&nbsp; The way I have always wanted to be hugged.&nbsp; His hair is white and scraggly like my  brother&rsquo;s, but his grip is strong and tight.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Gad  damn, kid!&nbsp; You was like a machine out theah!&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  look past his honeyed words hanging in the bloody air and see Moses lying on  the mat, motionless.&nbsp; One of his eyes is  literally dangling from its socket, and his chest is unmoving; un-breathing.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come  on, we got&rsquo;ta get you outta&rsquo; &lsquo;ere, kid,&rdquo; Wayne  says, grasping my shoulders and pushing me toward the exit.&nbsp; I can hear that the crowd is growing  restless.&nbsp; It sounds like a bee hive has  been kicked over, and Wayne  knows that we have to get out quick to keep from being stung.&nbsp; I guess that seeing the challenger dead and  seeing the Champion dead are two very different visions.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  look back one last time at the late Moses Early&rsquo;s lifeless form as we leave and  mutter to myself, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve paid for my brother&rsquo;s blood with your own&hellip;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
  <u>Part  Four:&nbsp; A Good Night&rsquo;s Sleep</u><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  clenched a fistful of dollars as I rushed up the stairs leading to our  apartment.&nbsp; I had been gone for only an  hour, and I couldn&rsquo;t wait to give Johnathon the good news.&nbsp; My key stuck in the lock as it always did,  and I had to fiddle with it for a few moments before it popped open.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately,  I knew that something was wrong.<br />
          {UTTER SILENCE}<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Johnathon?&rdquo;&nbsp; As I entered the room, I inquired half a  dozen times as to whether Johnathon was home, afraid to turn on the light.&nbsp; But of course, there was no reply.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  dropped the money and frantically fumbled about to find the light switch.&nbsp; The light confirmed my fears.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dashing  through the kitchen to Johnathon&rsquo;s room, I tripped over a stack of pizza boxes  and struck my leg against a wooden cabinet.&nbsp;  The pain in my leg was nothing compared to the pain in my soul, because  I already knew.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He  had made it almost all the way into his room.&nbsp;  I don&rsquo;t know how he summoned up the strength, because he had been unable  to even stand in those last few months, but he had almost made it.&nbsp; Johnathon lay stretched out in the hall, his  right hand just barely touching the closed door.&nbsp; <br />
          The silence was  maddening.&nbsp; Clich&eacute; as that sounds sounds,  it&rsquo;s true.<br />
          I could hear  myself screaming; crying vehemently as I gathered his paper doll body in my  arms.&nbsp; Words came with detached meaning  as I shouted with both anger and sorrow.&nbsp;  But these sounds only added to the silence, being swallowed by the  immitigable soundlessness that had settled on the apartment.<br />
  &ldquo;Why?&nbsp; Why, Johnathon?&nbsp; I won.&nbsp;  I won for you.&nbsp; I killed for  you.&nbsp; What the fuck is wrong with  you?!&rdquo;&nbsp; I realized fearfully that I  wasn&rsquo;t really angry at him.&nbsp; I saw my  reflection in his glaze-coated eyes and was filled with fury at the helplessness  I felt.&nbsp; &ldquo;What am I supposed to do?&nbsp; What am I to do now that you&rsquo;re gone?&nbsp; Who am I supposed to fight for?&nbsp; Who am I supposed to protect?&nbsp; I need you as much as you need me, you know!&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When  the calm settled in, I lifted Johnathon and opened the door to his room.&nbsp; A musty smell emanated from within, but I  ventured forth without trepidation.&nbsp; His  bed, after so many years of disuse, was dingy and disgusting to look at, but  Johnathon didn&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; I had to put him  to bed one last time.<br />
          The couch still  held Johnathon&rsquo;s outline.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  sat there for hours, wallowing in the silence before glancing over at the blood  machine.&nbsp; The tubes that had been connected  to Johnathon&rsquo;s veins rested upon the top of the machine, and there was dried  blood caking them.&nbsp; He had probably done  it shortly after I had gone out to the fight.&nbsp;  The last great crusade of a dying boy.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  tried to light a cigarette, flicking my lighter again and again to no avail.<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  rhythm was all wrong.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  looked to the <em>CellSaver</em> once more in  desperation and flipped it on.&nbsp; Then I curled  up on the couch, allowing the sound to envelop me in its peaceful cadence.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sleep  devoured me as I sank peacefully into my brother&rsquo;s silhouette.<br />
