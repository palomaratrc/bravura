	<h1>Earth Post Mortem</h1>
	<p>Joe Djordjevski</p>
	<p>A city  once full of life and color <br />
	  now  dead and colorless. <br />
	  It is a  graveyard of skyscrapers. <br />
	  Tall,  black skeletons. <br />
	  Once  proud and glorious edifices. <br />
	  Now  ruins. Some tilting to their side <br />
	  others  with chunks missing. <br />
	  As far  as the eye can see <br />
	  these  metallic gravestones litter the earth. <br />
	  Blackened  statues of leaders and heroes past<br />
	  lie  crooked and cracked. <br />
	  Frozen  forever in time.<br />
	  Time  catching up to them. <br />
	  Tense  clouds in the sky flex. <br />
	  Soon  they will burst into rain and thunder.</p>
	<p>City  streets once full of people and vehicles <br />
	  lie  desolate and empty. <br />
	  Over  grown plants and trees rise from cracked concrete. <br />
	  Nature  has taken over<br />
	  what  was once a people city.&nbsp; <br />
	  Crows  and buzzards fly above. <br />
	  Circling  and circling <br />
	  cawing  at a disgusting pitch. <br />
	  Old  papers of past news and magazine advertisements <br />
	  sweep  through the empty streets <br />
	  like  leaves with the wind. <br />
	  Wordless pages worn down with time. <br />
	  A page  from an old newspaper floats to my feet. <br />
	  I can  tell it had a hard life. <br />
	  It is  wrinkled, yet stiff.<br />
	  Words  are faded <br />
	  and run  down from water contact. <br />
	  I can  make out part of the headline. <br />
	  It says  &ldquo;Apocalypse? The Fall of Western Civili&hellip;&rdquo; <br />
	  The  rest of the sentence is a ghost <br />
	  vanished  from the paper. <br />
	  I let  it go.<br />
	  It  quickly gets back into its rhythm with the wind. <br />
	  The  wind whistles through the streets.<br />
	  The  only sound in the whole city <br />
	  besides  the crow&rsquo;s and buzzard&rsquo;s awful caws. <br />
	  The sky  starts to darken. <br />
	  The  old, decrepit streetlights are useless. <br />
	  Now  nothing more than support for ever-growing vines. <br />
	  The  vines that seem to pull on every thing they hold <br />
	  down  toward the ground <br />
	  while  the object they pull fights to stay on its feet. <br />
	  The  vines are too strong for them. <br />
	  Soon  they will all give in. </p>
	<p>The  wind stops and the debris and papers floating with it <br />
	  succumb  to gravity and fall to the earth. <br />
	  A lone  raindrop hits the black ground. <br />
	  Smoke  rises from the spot of asphalt the drop hits. <br />
	  It is  time to take cover <br />
	  before  more drops fall. <br />
	  I run  under what&rsquo;s left of a rusted, metal overhang <br />
	  once  used for a caf&eacute; or a restaurant. <br />
	  The  countless pieces of debris <br />
	  that  litter the sidewalks and streets <br />
	  begin  to smoke as drops of rain splash against them.<br />
	  A loud,  high-pitched hiss from the smoking rain<br />
	  pierces  my eardrums. <br />
	  Soon  the whole city will be smoking <br />
	  as the  rain falls. <br />
	  A  terrible smell attacks my scent. <br />
	  It  smells of strong chemicals <br />
	  unnatural  to the senses. <br />
	  Sharp  and bitter <br />
	  making  my nostrils cringe. <br />
	  I cover  my mouth and my nose <br />
	  with my  cold, pale hand. <br />
	  I take  short breaths<br />
	  trying  to avoid the chemical smell. <br />
	  The  smoke soon embellishes the entire landscape. <br />
	  It  makes its way into my haven and clouds my vision. <br />
	  I can  no longer see anything but gray. <br />
	  I go  dizzy and nauseous. <br />
	  I will  be dead soon. <br />
    Like  everyone else. </p></td>
