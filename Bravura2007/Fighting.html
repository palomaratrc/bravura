        <h1>Fighting Against Home</h1>
         <p>Marco Morales</p>
          My father used to  tell me, &ldquo;Marco, a respectable man is the one who does what he says, and he  does it because his credibility is at risk.&rdquo; My father is a respected person  who, thanks to his hard work of picking avocados for more than twenty years,  has been able to earn enough to support his family. He decided that my future  was in the United States. I was a fifteen year old adolescent who respected his  father; therefore, my duty was to follow his decision, and it did not matter if  I agreed or disagreed with that choice. Finally, the day we traveled to the U.S. my father  and my mother woke up at 1:00 am. They were talking about my brother and me. I was  awake at the time they woke up. I was covered with my blanket listening word  for word to what my mother told my father. I did not stand up because I did not  want to interrupt their conversation. I waited in bed two minutes more, and  finally I stood up. I saw my short, plump and lovely mother packing some of my clothes.  Then, I stepped back to my dark room and listened to my mother asking my father  again to take care of us. My heart was broken; I could not stand to see my  lovely mother crying and repeatedly asking my father to promise to take care of  us. During that cold morning of October 12 of 2001, I faced the saddest and  hardest day of my life because I had to separate from my mother to start a new  life in the United States.  After that day, I decided that no matter how long or what it takes, I was going  to work hard in getting an education to pay back my mother and father what they  suffered to give me an opportunity to enjoy a better future. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  unforgettable day at home was a lot of tension. My sisters were crying, and my  younger brother was playing with his toys. I remember that my younger brother  asked me, &ldquo;Marqui, where are you going?&rdquo; The silence took possession of  everybody at home. Five seconds later, my dog&rsquo;s bark ended the silence. I  answered my little brother, &ldquo;I do not know where I am going,&rdquo; and then I started  crying. At that point, I understood how much I loved all my family and how  necessary they were to me. Then, I heard from my father the words that through  all the morning I was waiting for, &ldquo;Guys, it is time, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; At that  moment, I put my face down. My eyes got wet, my legs started shaking, and all  my body got involved in an ecstasy of adrenalin. Then, my father, my older  brother, and I began the six hour journey to the airport. I was in the back of the  truck lying down with my face uncovered. I was watching the stars and thinking  about leaving my town behind. At that moment, all my childhood came to my mind.  I was hoping that everything that I was living was a dream and that I would  wake up laughing about it. Reality was different; I was going to live in another  country and not in the one I was born in. My dreams to work hard to help my own  country to be a better one were in the trash. I realized that the old blue Ford  was on the freeway because the cold air increased. My body was freezing, but my  body was not the only thing I had frozen. One part of my life was frozen too. For  every mile the truck moved forward, my family, my friends, and my old way of  life were left behind too. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My  father found my freezing body and broken heart, when he pulled the blankets from  me. That&rsquo;s all I can say about the fifteen year old child. My father told me, &ldquo;Marco,  we are in the international airport   of Mexico, it is time;  let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; My father helped me with my bag, because I looked sick. We got  inside the airport, and my father bought me some pills. Finally, after two  hours waiting, we went into the airplane that had the mission to take us to the  city of Tijuana.  During the three and half hour flight, I was thinking about my situation. I  thought for a moment, &ldquo;Ok, Marco, you are here and nothing is going a change  that fact. Now, your future is in your hands. The wrong attitude you are having  is not going to get you anywhere.&rdquo; So, I decided to accept my situation. Now in  the new country, I was going to have the opportunity to continue with my  education and I could have the opportunity to get a better life in the U.S. than in Mexico. My thoughts were interrupted  by the flight attendant who served me a snack. I looked at her and I noticed  that she was gentle and nice. Then, another thought came to me, in the new  environment there could be nice and kind people like the flight attendant. My  mind changed when I focused my attention on the good things that I was going to  experience. When we arrived at Tijuana,  I was anxious to get in the taxi. I wanted to know my new home and environment  because a new life was waiting for me.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At  2:00 P.M. when the airplane arrived at Tijuana,  I was a new person; the new Marco became enthusiastic to discover what was  behind the American culture and anxious to know more individuals with the same  beliefs. My father asked my brother and me to go eat before going to Pauma Valley,  which was going to be my new town for the next three years. We went to the  center of Tijuana  to eat some tacos. I was very hungry, therefore, I ate six delicious beef  tacos. I was almost finishing my last taco, when a man got closer to me asking  for money to buy some tacos. I got scared because it was the first time something  like that had happened to me. My father did not give the person the money;  instead, he bought him some tacos to eat with us. My father told us later, &ldquo;If  we want to help the people, it is better to give them food instead of money  because instead of buying food sometimes they use the money to buy drugs or  alcohol.&rdquo; I discovered that my father knew what he was doing, and that I did  not have to worry about problems in my new life because my father would be  there to support me. Later at the border line, my father pointed at some  individuals that were running across the street and some border police officers  were behind them. My father told my brother and me, &ldquo;Give thanks to God that  you are lucky to have your papers in order because other people like those  running have to cross the border line illegally, putting their lives in risk.&rdquo;  As the people running disappeared, I analyzed my father&rsquo;s words. I realized that  he was right, so I thought, &ldquo;I am lucky.&rdquo; Then, I felt sorry for those people  who want to fulfill their American dream, putting at risk their lives trying to  accomplish it. I thanked God because I had the right to come and go from the United States  with no problem. <br />
          When I had to pass  to show my green card to the official in charge, I was nervous because I was  leaving my old life. Also, I was anxious to begin a new life that would make my  future a better one. When I crossed the border, my mom crying came to my mind.  Then, I promised to myself that the effort that my parents were making would  not be in vain. My life changed completely from one day to another, and October  12 will be always in my memory, as the day I discovered that I was lucky to  have a family who loved me and would support me if something happened to me. I  also learned that day that sometimes it is necessary to leave our loved ones to  make a better future. The moment I crossed the border line, my father turned to  my brother and me. We made eye contact, and he said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; <br />
