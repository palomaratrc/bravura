        <h1>From One Man to  Another</h1>
         <p>Matt Schnarr</p>
        <p>&quot;Buy one pie, get one free&quot;...I've been staring at  that sign for about an hour now. I see a lot of grim faces behind it. Are they  just buying the pie to get something free out of it? It doesn't look like  they're buying it for the joy and happiness it brings them. Is the  gratification of receiving more for your money worth the bland taste of dry  blood between layers of ply board? What has this world come to? There's a shop  across the street that sells pies for half as much, and they make you feel like  your mother just gave you a loving kiss...makes you feel at home. The crust  melts in your mouth releasing the filling to your taste buds through a river of  sugar. Then the flavor permeates; like fresh roses in a small room on a fine  summer day in South Louisiana. Its not fancy, and it doesn't have its own  store, but it's literally a small price to pay for a small slice of heaven. It  brings you joy and enlightenment, the world makes sense for the ten minutes  that you savor the flavor. Then you finish the crust, come back to reality, and  you exit out the door to saunter back to your jobs like zombies.</p>
        <p>It's so dead out there...like a plague hit the town leaving  everyone to mourn their losses. But the sun is out and the sky is so blue it  takes you back to the womb. But no one is looking up, so they wouldn't notice.  They're all looking ahead, going block to block, mile to mile, day to day,  until years have gone by and they look up at that last moment; and it doesn't  matter anymore. Or they're looking down, burdened by the ideas imprinted in  their mind that they can't match up to...they, most of all, need to feel the  sunlight. There are a few that look up, they enjoy life, they enjoy every last  minute, every breath, every step, everything...even tears. No one notices them  either. Even the ones looking ahead avoid eye contact, fearing that they'll  find someone more worse off than them. And that would be a tragedy; how can you  complain about the &quot;not-so-bad&quot; life you've received, but never  really wanted, if there's someone else out there who actually has a shit life.<br />
          So self centered...they create a gravity pull around them,  everyone falls into it, and listens to the complaints of a  double-digit-thousand-a-year job that doesn't fuel them anymore...the center of  this conceited universe. I have no sympathy for them, they have a job, they  have a family, they have a home. What the hell do they want? Maybe if they  stopped this self-pity banter they'd realize everything they could ever want is  right in front of them. But they can't stop talking, so they pay someone to  listen to them, or they pay someone to love them, they look for joy in all the  wrong places, and that my friend, that causes the joy of those around them to  burn out. Suspicion, addiction, depression, neglect, abuse; all of these are  side effects from these prescriptions of comfort...and malice. Desire to cause  someone pain to erase yours, that is truly a twisted logic. The pain can be  physical, but in most cases, such as yours Mr. Randal, it is mental.</p>
        <p>You have a high paying job, you've worked hard to be  promoted, to earn more money and even more work than before. You've secured  yourself a family, and you've supported them the whole time financially. But  families don't just want support, they want love, respect, they need more than  just your picture in a fathers day frame that still has the receipt in the  back. Even you need these things, and you'll try to find something to quench  that thirst....but more importantly, your family will too; and maybe some of  them already have. Some of them are hurt. Because they find no love in you they  are replacing their pain with happiness in something or someone else, by adding  to yours. You're looking impatient so I'll get to the point. No, Mr. Randal. I  will not take your money to watch your wife. It really isn't my concern, and it  definitely isn't my problem. I find the light where only darkness remains, I  take money to help, and no light will be revealed from this to help any  situation at any price.</p>
        <p>Perhaps you should look up, look at the sky sir. Have a  bottle of realization instead another off-brand beer. Maybe you should take  time off from work to see your wife in a shady green park, instead of making  shady appointments with private dicks. Instead of suspecting, instead building  on that pain you've caused yourself vicariously through her, maybe you should  confront your wife about this...and whether or not there is any situation, you  should take time to heal it. But you know what I am going to do? I'm going to  pay the bill Mr. Randal, this meeting was on me, I'm going to walk out that  door, look up at the afternoon blue, breathe in the cool air, and joyfully walk  back to my office. I'll smile as I open the door, toss my hat to the rack,  politely ask my secretary, who has been sitting there oh so long, to get my  wife on the phone, to whom I will gingerly say that dinner sounds lovely. I  suggest you do the same, but before leaving, you really should try the pie.</p>
