<center><b>Clinton vs. the Super Bowl</b><br>
By Clayton Beach</center><br><br>

<p>This is the story of my brother, Clinton Block, and his battle with the Super Bowl.  The first thing to know is that he’s been battling the Super Bowl since birth.  It’s been a bitter battle ever since that fateful day, January 24, 1982, when he decided it was time to come into this world half way through the most televised sporting event in human history.  Story goes, Momma told Daddy it was time, and Daddy told Momma she’d have to wait for the end of the game.  She ended up giving birth to Clinton on the floor right there beside the old television.  It was a big old wooden box with dials and rabbit ears back then.  Momma bought Daddy a nice, new color TV from Sears the Christmas before that fateful Super Bowl Block party, the day of the final show down, but I’ll get to that later.  Aunt Kathy helped deliver ole Clinton, and he was bright and pink and screaming, and Daddy had to wait until the commercial break to see his first born son.</p>
<p>Clinton was a disappointment to the family.  All the Block men were sure that he was gonna turn out queer or communist or something equally disgusting, like an artist.  Uncle Chris said he was too smart and too feminine.  He wouldn’t go outside and play football or softball with the neighborhood boys.  He’d just sit inside and read.  I’d be playing with my dolls in my room, or having my girlfriends over for slumber parties, and old Clinton, he’d just be sitting on the sofa with his nose in a book.  He started with Stephen King, all those terrible horror novels.  Can you imagine that, reading those terrible things when you were eight years old?  I was a year older than him, and I still reading my Babysitter’s Club, but I’ve always been a pretty average girl.  After he got sick of old Mr. King, he graduated to reading the Sci-fi.  I remember after one book he made me and Buddy, our little brother, who came along three years after Clinton and was about as different as little brother could possibly be, but ole Clinton, he made us all drink water from the same cup and started saying we were “water brothers.”  He started saying funny stuff like “Thou art God,” and Momma washed his mouth out with soap for blasphemy.  That was the end of science fiction for Clinton, Momma made him stick to literature after that.  </p>
<p>By the time he was eleven, he started writing little poems.  Uncle Chris was sure it was the devil.  He was doomed to be a queer after that, Chris told my Daddy, there was no hope for that boy.  No baseball, no football, and a poet, thank God for Buddy, who was already getting into trouble at school, starting fights and being the star quarterback of the neighborhood football  team.  He was the lone shining hope for the Block men.  Well, that and Uncle Chris’ three fine sons.  The strange thing was, old Buddy looked up to Clinton, and he’d defend his strange older brother with the love and admiration those Apostle’s must have had for our Lord Jesus Christ.  Ole Clinton was smart, really smart.  He was always at the top of the class in marks, but nobody paid much attention to him on account of his always having his nose shoved in a book.  All throughout recess and after school too, just reading and reading.  Sometimes he’d talk about his books to me.  I liked that.  He’d tell me stories about murderers and drug addicts, all sorts of strange and wonderful, terribly blasphemous stuff.  He didn’t go much for books about Jesus or God.    </p>
<p>Clinton hated television, and above all he hated televised sports.  He’d throw a fit every time somebody came into the living room where he was reading and flipped on the tube.  He’d get real moody while he read.  Sometimes you’d see him in his room, laughing like a maniac, other times he’d be in there crying, shaking his head and crying.  Uncle Chris always said it was ‘cause he was a queer.  All that reading, all that crying, “real men go out and play football,” Uncle Chris said.  “He’s gonna be a communist and a queer if he keeps on reading all that Russian crap.  No good ever come out of an American boy reading Russian books.” </p>
<p>I might agree with that, ‘cause Clinton started acting awfully weird around my girl friends when he started reading that one Russian guy.  I was thirteen, which would have made him twelve.  My friend Dolly stopped coming to our house.  She said Clinton was giving her the creeps.  He kept staring at her real weird every time she came over.  One time she even thought she saw him in the bushes outside her window.  She only lived two blocks away, so it could have been him.  Clinton was a strange boy, that’s for sure.  </p>
<p>But I should get back to the story at hand, back to the battle of the Super Bowl.  You see, Clinton’s birthday was a very bad time of the year for a sensitive little boy to have a birthday.  It was close enough to Christmas that everybody was all spent out.  Maybe Momma might get him a new book or something, but if he ever got something big for Christmas, it was bound to be a Christmas/Birthday combination present.  The worst part was that he never got a birthday party.  Our family always got so caught up in the excitement leading up to the Super Bowl, so caught up with the play offs and the wild cards that they always forgot about Clinton’s birthday.  He was so prideful that he’d never remind them.  He expected everybody to remember that it was his birthday, and didn’t want me or Buddy to remind anyone.  He thought that they should remember it themselves, that they should make a big deal out of his birthday “without coercion.”  Every year he was sorely disappointed.  On his thirteenth birthday, right after Momma bought the big old color TV for daddy, the year Momma and Daddy decided to have the whole neighborhood and the whole family over for a Super Bowl Block Party Extravaganza to celebrate the Super Bowl coming home to Florida, ole Clinton decided he had enough.  He was going to ruin the Super Bowl.  </p>
<p>Momma started the preparations that Saturday.  She spent all Saturday shopping with Buddy and me.  We drove down to Frattelli’s, the old supermarket which has since gone under and turned into a Von’s, and we bought all sorts of great things.  We bought chicken, steak, hamburgers and hotdogs for the barbeque and all sorts of fixings.  We bought lots of potato chips and veggies and dip.  We bought a whole cart full of pop and beer and loaded the coolers full of ice.  Momma even bought three dozen eggs for making her special deviled eggs.  I always wondered why a good Christian woman would be making “deviled” eggs.   </p>
<p>Buddy and I helped Momma unload everything while Clinton sulked upstairs.  Well, it seemed like he was sulking at the time, since in the excitement leading up to the big game, everyone had forgotten that his thirteenth birthday was last Tuesday.  In truth, he was upstairs plotting his revenge.  We unloaded the groceries, put the eggs and the meat in the kitchen refrigerator, and loaded up the coolers with ice, pop and beer.  The tension was thick.  It was more exciting than Christmas Eve, New Year’s Eve and Easter all rolled into one.  Daddy was running around the house like a little boy.  It was on, tomorrow we would get up early for the sunrise service, pray to the Lord for a good game and then go home and start preparing all the food for the Super Bowl Block Party Extravaganza.  Momma and Daddy were expecting the whole family and lots of neighbors.  There might be as many as sixty people.  I couldn’t even imagine that many people crammed into our little house.  </p>
<p>That night, when everyone had gone to bed, Clinton snuck outside and set off the circuit breaker.  We all woke up too late to attend the sunrise service, ‘cause with the breaker off Daddy’s alarm clock didn’t sound, and Momma screamed when she went downstairs to find a warm refrigerator full of spoiled meats and eggs.  “Oh no!  The party is ruined!”  She screamed upstairs to Daddy.  There was no way we could afford to buy that much food over again.  There was no time.  It was going to be hotdogs and chips without any dip.  Momma frantically called to tell all of our family members and some of the friendlier neighbors about the tragedy, and that the party had unexpectedly turned into a potluck.  Nobody suspected a thing about old Clinton.  </p>
<p>They started coming in about eleven o’clock, which didn’t give us much time to get ready after our late start.  Uncle Chris and his family were first, his three boys running around like poster children for an ADD medication.  He camped out on the sofa right away and popped his first Coors Light of the game.  He’d be drunk and screaming at the television by kick off time.  The house filled up bit by bit, and people were great about bringing snacks and food.  In fact, their generosity was such that we had more food and snacks than we would have had without Clinton’s little disaster.  So far, his plan had backfired.  The house filled with the babble of all of Momma, our Aunties and the neighborhood women gossiping about shopping and their husbands, while from the living room the men were watching the pre-game coverage and shooting the bull.  The beer and the pop were flowing like the wells of Silver Springs.  I overheard uncle Chris ranting about how disappointed he was in both teams being from California.  San Francisco, land of the queers, and San Diego, land of the pot-head surfers.  “What kind of game can you expect with teams from the land of queers and pot-head surfers?”  He mused, “They don’t even like Nascar out there.  You can’t trust a state that doesn’t like Nascar!”  The only positive thing he saw was that the game was being played here in Florida, even though Miami was full of spics.  “Why can’t they have the game up here in Naples?”  Nobody bothered to point out that the facts that Naples didn’t even have a professional team or a stadium big enough to house the world’s most important game.  </p>
<p>At kickoff time, Clinton struck again, the circuit breaker went off just as the game started, and Uncle Chris screamed in agony.  I thought he was going to cry.  Daddy went down and reset the breaker, making a comment about how there was a storm brewing outside and it must be all the static electricity.  He was starting to suspect that Clinton, whose usually spewed a bunch of vicious slander against the game and who had been suspiciously quiet all day, may have had something to do with the ‘happenings.’  Daddy pulled Clinton aside and gave him a talking to, and afterward he went up to his room and sulked for about fifteen minutes.  The women continued to gossip and eat, and the men drank beers in the other room.  They grunted and groaned, yelled and hollered with every play, hanging on the edge of their seats.  </p>
<p>When Clinton came downstairs, he pulled Buddy and Me outside and confessed.  </p>
<p>“Look, I’m trying to strike back at the Super Bowl for ruining my birthday, will you guys help me?”</p>
<p>Buddy rubbed his freshly buzzed head, “What’re thinking of doing.  I kind of want to watch the game.”</p>
<p>“Look, this stupid game has been ruining my life since the day I was born, are you going to help or not?”</p>
<p>Buddy rubbed his head again.  “Ok, but what are you going to do?”</p>
<p>“What about you Sissy, are you in?”</p>
<p>“Sure Clinton, I wanna see what you’ve got up your sleeve”</p>
<p>“Nothing much, you see, I’ve already done my big sneak attacks, and they haven’t seemed to have worked.  I figure we can just be annoying as hell.  Remember when we were little and we used to have our parades?”  </p>
<p>We went down into the cellar to get instruments for the “parade.”  Clinton had never got any music lessons, daddy figured the boy was queer enough already, and didn’t need any extra encouragement down the “artist’s path,” so he just grabbed an old marching snare drum that we had picked up in the garage sale.  I had violin lessons here and there, as every proper southern lady learns a parlor trick.  Buddy had shown a lot of promise on the clarinet in the school Jazz band, and being that he excelled in the sports, Daddy didn’t see much harm in Buddy getting some lessons.  </p>
<p>“Let’s make as much God awful noise as we can”  Clinton said with an evil grin, and her started marching outside the living room window.  We marched back and forth outside, Clinton taking the lead with the battered old snare.  He banged away with his loudest roll and would finish with a big old rim shot.  Rat-a-tat-a-tat-a-rat-a-tat-a-tat WHAM!  Rat-a-tat-a-tat-a-rat-a-tat-a-tat WHAM!    I was hacking away on my violin with the scratchiest, most terrible touch I could muster.  That poor instrument hadn’t screamed that bad since my first lesson six years earlier.  Mrs. Snodgrass, my violin teacher, would have had a heart attack if she had heard me play that bad.  Old buddy just kept playing his newest trick, the harmonic minor that Mr. King had just taught him, and he snaked along its middle eastern intervals with the liquid grace of a snake charmer.  Any cobras in the area would have been floating high above the grass.  Clinton picked up on the middle eastern theme and started singing arabesques high and loud in a falsetto, all snaky and microtonal.  Soon we were all out there dancing and singing and playing and banging away.  It was the most god awful ruckus I’d ever heard.  </p>
<p>Uncle Chris stormed out of the house furious.  Evidently the game had finally reached a commercial break and he was able to escape for a minute to yell at us.   </p>
<p>“What in the hell do you think you kids are doing!” he screamed as he staggered down the porch steps.  His eyes were glowing red and he reeked of beer.  </p>
<p>“We’re having a parade”  Clinton answered, his eyes fixed Uncle Chris like two  blue balls of ice.  He faced his Uncle with bravado, hands at his sides like they were hanging above an old pair of six shooters.  The storm was building fast, and the air swarmed with a hornet’s nest of static electricity.  </p>
<p>“You’re making a God awful racket and it’s time to stop.”  Chris was sizing up his little adversary, somewhere in that drunken fuzz he knew this little shit had been sabotaging the game all day.  “You know what your problem is, you’ve got no respect for your elders.”</p>
<p>“Why should I respect a bunch of stupid assholes just ‘cause they’re older than me.  I’m sick of being pushed around by people who have half of my intelligence.  You treat me like a child, but you’re the one with the mind of a child.”</p>
<p>Chris up and slapped him across the face, but instead of falling to the ground, Clinton bounced up like he was spring loaded and kicked Chris in the balls.  Chris dropped, but grabbed Clinton by the right arm and slapped him again.  Clinton swung at his face with his left but Chris caught it, and he shoved Clinton to the ground and sat on his chest with his arms pinned crosswise underneath.  It looked silly, that giant of a man, 6’5 and 200 pounds piled up on top of a scrawny teenager’s chest, but there was nothing funny about it.  Clinton writhed below our uncle, trying to kick him but unable to, trying to scratch with his hands but unable, so he spat in Chris’ face and tried to bite.  His face bright red, and his eyes shone like diamonds through the tears.  I’d never seen such animal ferocity in anyone, let alone someone I loved, it was terrifying.  I grabbed a rock and threw it at Chris ‘cause I was afraid he was going to hurt my brother even more.  Buddy went and shoved him off while he was dazed.  Momma came out and screamed for every one to stop.  Chris was bleeding from his temple thanks to me, and Clinton was on the ground trembling.  Momma berated Chris for acting like a child and it was decided that Buddy, Clinton and I would all have to spend the rest of the party in the cellar for attacking our Uncle.     </p>
<p>We sat in the darkness and silence for the first twenty minutes.  The game went on upstairs.  The women babbled their incessant gossip and the men screamed their manly football screams, cheering for teams that they wouldn’t have liked on any other day, choosing sides between the queers or the pot-head surfers, rooting for whoever they thought was the lesser of two evils and getting drunk.  Clinton was still trembling.  The racking sobs had subsided to a slow heave.  Buddy was pacing, kicking at the dirt floor.  </p>
<p>“What a jerk, I can’t believe Momma didn’t care that he hit Clinton.”</p>
<p>“In Momma’s view, Clinton deserved it.  He was being disrespectful to his elders”   </p>
<p>“Yeah, but Uncle Chris is a big jerk!”  </p>
<p>“I know buddy, but there’s nothing we can do.  We’re all locked up in dry old cellar with the rats and the dirty laundry.”  I said, looking over to Clinton.  He was sitting on the floor, all hunched over with his head between his knees on his crossed arms.   </p>
<p>“Or rats’ feet over broken glass in our dry cellar”  Clinton muttered through his crossed arms, and then chuckled.  His long hair was wet with tears.  Momma had been trying to get him to cut his hair for months, she said he was almost looking like Jesus Christ himself.  </p>
<p>“What did you say?”</p>
<p>“Nothing, listen, do we have any games down here?”</p>
<p>Buddy strolled over to a box marked GAMES.  “Connect Four?  Sorry? How about Clue, I’ll let you be Professor Plum!”  </p>
<p>Clinton rolled his eyes, “Never mind, you know, I don’t think I actually feel like playing games right now.”</p>
<p>Another outburst of male screaming and shouting came from upstairs.  A low rumble of thunder shook the floorboards.  </p>
<p>“That’s some storm that’s brewing.”  I said, to break the mood, then I remembered something, something that would make things better.  I found some candles and matches in a drawer and went to the old refrigerator that we used to store extra pop and beer.  I had hidden the cupcakes that I had baked for Clinton’s birthday down here and forgotten all about them until that moment.  Buddy was pacing again and Clinton had resumed his sulking, head down over crossed arms.  They didn’t notice as I slipped a cupcake out of the refrigerator and put in a candle.  I cut the lights and lit a match and then started the Birthday song.  Buddy joined in by the first “to you” and we were all smiling and laughing by the time we both sang the last.  </p>
<p>“Make a wish” said Buddy, his smile was warm and loving.  </p>
<p>“Are you sure?”  Asked Clinton, his face slack and emotionless.</p>
<p>“Yeah stupid, it’s your birthday, make a wish.”</p>
<p>“Anything I want?”</p>
<p>“Anything you want.”</p>
<p>“Ok,” he said, “If you say so,” and he sat with his head down for a moment, then he looked up.  The single flame of the candle shone double in his eyes.  They were cold and distant, a little puffy around the edges from all that crying, but the eyes themselves stared with an uncomfortable clarity.  They seemed to stare past that flickering little flame, through the walls of the cellar, through the earth and the stone, through space and through time.  He took a deep breath and he blew out the candle.  I was expecting darkness as the candle blew out, but instead the room flashed with an eerie white light.  Our shadows danced like skeletons in the brilliant white flash, and then darkness swallowed us as the thunder boomed and the house shook violently with the suddenly screaming wind.</p>
<p>Another chorus of booming man screams came from above, telling us that the party continued unbothered by the storm.  Buddy went up to the little rectangular window at the top of the cellar wall, using the rusty old ping pong table for a perch.  </p>
<p>“Oh my God” he stood there, his chubby face a blank slate.  He was pale and ghostlike, either from fright or from the quality of light that sifted down from the window.  “Oh no, it’s a twister!”</p>
<p>I jumped up to look.  Sure enough, a big gray horn loomed on the horizon.  It was slowly winding its way through the fields behind our house.  It was coming right for us.  </p>
<p>“What’ll we do?”  cried buddy.  “How will we warn everybody?”</p>
<p>“We can’t”  Clinton was beside us now.  “There’s no way they’ll hear us over the noise of that God damned television.”  He sighed, “Even if they did they’d think we were making a final attack on their blessed game.  Besides, it’s almost upon us.  Let’s take shelter on the other side of the room.”</p>
<p>The twister hit seconds later.  Buddy and I buried our faces into Clinton’s chest while he sat there calmly, his legs folded like the Buddha.  He held us both in his skinny arms, as strong and as stoic as a golden statue.  He sat there, calm and collected, not even flinching when the little window shattered, unmoved by the hideous shriek and unbelievable noise of our little house exploding above.  It sounded like steel toothpicks in a Titan’s blender.  The floorboards above us creaked and moaned, one broke loose and let in a stream of weak gray light.  </p>
<p>The twister was gone as quickly as it had come, but all three of us had to work together with an old four by four to ram the cellar doors open.  Momma had locked us in from the outside.  Up top the scene was complete desolation.  The houses on either side of us had been flattened.  Nothing remained of our house but the foundation and the old wood floor.  </p>
<p>I started to cry, and Buddy just sat there staring where the living room used to be, where our whole family had been having a party just minutes earlier.  </p>
<p>“Would you imagine that!”  Clinton chuckled.  “Old chatterbox survived!”  </p>
<p>Sitting there, where the living room used to be, the Television set sat unscathed.  The cable hadn’t even been knocked out.  As we all surrounded it, the game came back from commercials.  The queers were winning.  Clinton laughed again, and kicked old chatterbox off of his pedestal.  The tube broke with a pop and a fizz.  </p>
<p>“Let’s see if we can’t find a working telephone to call for some help”  he said, like we were deciding to take a walk to the drug store for some candy.  He walked off down the street, a swing in his step and whistle just under his breath.   </p>
