<center><b>One Night in Paris</b><br>
By Kyle Ray</center><br><br>

<p>I used to stand out on the side of my parents’ house, by my window.  I would chain smoke cigarettes until my beer was empty, and just be silent.  Everyday standing with my back against the rough stucco wall, listening to the crows and planes passing overhead, against the hum of the 15 freeway off to the east.  It was always a lonely sort of affair, but I suppose I enjoyed the loneliness.  </p>
<p>My imagination would run wild with thoughts of grandeur.  Scenarios of five star hotel rooms in Milan or Paris.  Old hotels, with history and ornate victorian tea rose wallpaper in various shades of red and gold.  Eggshell white trim, baseboards and a radiator heater that is almost more fashion than function. If the door is in the north wall, a minimalist style rosewood bed is against the west wall. Matching minimalist rosewood furniture mingles throughout the room wearing accessories of discarded designer clothing, half empty and spent bottles of alcohol, and an assortment of all other accouterments that furniture tends to pick up from the Haberdashery of Wild Fucking.  I sit up with my back against a pillow against the headboard. I am naked and so is she.  She is a model one year my junior from some eastern european country. She has that certain type of beauty that tends to emerge from poor cities with red skies and horizons marked with smokestack trunks and canopies of smoke like a sick industrial forrest.  Her name ends with the letter A, as most female names from that region do. What her name really is matters little to me, in my imagination or otherwise. If pressed I would say Ivanka or Ionna or Nikola, but then again maybe she’s French.  </p>
<p>French is the ideal language to hear whispered in your ear when you have nude breasts pressed against your chest and legs wrapped around your hips.  But then again I would seldom fantasize about the actual sex act when I’d drink and smoke on the side of my house.  Her accent is not important in these sorts of daydreams because she is never talking anyway. She just lays nude on top of a white down comforter delicately holding a pretentious cigarette as smoke slowly dances out of her perfect pouting lips past her large dark eyes and gracefully hangs in the air like morning mist on a pond. She is on her side facing me with her legs slightly bent, I take in the landscape of her delicate curves as he finger taps her cigarette. An ash falls into an ashtray that won design prizes and costs too much. My cigarette kisses hers briefly and then returns to my mouth. There is stubble on my face, my torso and arms are more defined, and my index finger isn’t crooked. My lower half is under the high thread count, egyptian cotton sheets, as I have no desire to see my post-coital phallus in a fantasy or otherwise.  An antique record player plays Yves Montand.  This fantasy plays on repeat in my head, like a ten second clip from a Fellini movie, with perfect lighting, balance and mes en scence.  </p><br><br>

<p>On the side of my parent's house I swallowed the last gulp of beer and stubbed out a cigarette, and bitterly awoke from this orgy of the aesthetic.  I’ve always been pained by my ability to imagine my life better than it was.  This fantasy was an ideally mutated version of me and my girlfriend, Annie’s first anniversary.  We stayed at an old hotel but we were in one of the more modern wings that had been added on in the seventies.  I paid almost three hundred bucks for one night, and it was just ok, the room was nonsmoking, so we had to go out into the freezing cold to smoke and enjoy our view of a wall ten feet in front of us.  The room was filled with white wicker furniture, and pastel colors, it had about as much character as a dentist’s waiting room.  The next morning I woke up with a hang over that was amplified by the jack hammering on the street below.  Annie went and got me breakfast but I was so hung over and everything was too loud and bright for me to enjoy anything. </p>
<p>The Greek philosopher Epictitus wrote about the problem of comparing the actual to the ideal, but his solution of abandoning, or ignoring these very human feelings, seems easier said than done.  We are stuck with the ability to imagine a better life as we are stuck with the ability to feel pain.  No wonder Socrates is more popular.</p>
<p>There on the side of my house, a quarter-life crisis washed over me.  guilt and self-loathing nagged me, asking me why I wasn’t doing something more fulfilling than waiting tables, floating through college and still living at home.  The Yves Montand record in my mind abruptly scratched off as my grown up, better toned, jet setting, model fucking inner child jammed his cigarette in the expensive ashtray and matter-of-factly and spoke words escorted by foul smoke “You’re lazy.”</p>
<p>He had a point.  Perhaps an easy childhood and dumb luck had rendered me lazy.  Great ideas I had never written, plans never reaching fruition, potential never realized.  Since I was young, people have told me that I was talented, good looking, smart, funny.  I had believed them, but not enough to eclipse my self doubt.  Some nights I would lay in bed trying to in vain escape to sleep as my hands shook from too much coffee and cigarettes, tormented by the fear of my life being forgotten.  The fear that if I did realize my potential, I, and the world, would also realize I totally was full of shit, a phony, forgettable. </p>
<p>What a stupid fear for a waiter to have.  As it stood then, I was paid to bring people food, make family-safe jokes, and pretend I gave a shit about the suckers sitting at my tables, this sort of life is guaranteed to be forgotten.  No need for fear,  my achievements were sitting at coffee shops reading books, being clever, drinking coffee, chain smoking, pedantically talking at my girlfriend or anyone that would listen, and pretended to be intellectual. I was full of shit.</p>
<p>Normally after my side yard meditations, I would go back inside and clean my room or do some other minute task to make me feel like I had accomplished something.  But that day I had been too hard on myself for a simple task to clear my mind.  Instead I went on the internet and scoured postings for writing jobs.  I soon found out that I wasn’t qualified for any and started scanning auditions for modeling and acting jobs. All you needed to qualify for most auditions was a head shot and dumb luck.  All I needed was pictures.  </p><br><br>

<p>Now at this point I might start going into that trite, inspiring story about hard work, persistence, and paying dues, and overcoming impossible odds to finally one day have your dreams come true.  But I won’t.  That was the kind of story that drove me to do something dumb like move to Los Angeles.  I would hate to give credence to that sort of L.A. success story.  Perhaps I will do some good in this world if I keep one person from becoming another part of the cholesterol of misery and delusion that clogs the arteries of that collagen injected perdition called Los Angeles.  </p>
<p>The other reason I will fail to tell an inspiring story is because it wasn’t.  I left my friends and girlfriend Annie, to spend 23 months waiting in L.A. traffic with people that drove like their position in traffic was a representation of their position in life.  They’d be damned if they were going to let anybody else get ahead of them. In L.A. your blinker is not a signal, it’s a threat.  What was once a common courtesy, now betrays you, by letting the other guy know your plans of get ahead of him, and he’s “not gonna take that shit” from you.  </p>
<p>After getting through the traffic I would wait in line at auditions.  People at auditions all began to seem the same, I don’t know how many times I’ve been in line next to Aidan Black, or Nick Lane: He’s a D.J.(he fucks around with records and turn tables at house parties). His passions are film (he loves Tom Cruise movies, and The Matrix,) and music, “everything but country,” (he’s been listening to the same mix CD with Maroon 5 and Yellowcard in his car for 3 months, and thinks his appreciation for “old music like Jimi Hendrix” is profound.)  He knows, or is related to so and so(‘s brother’s friend.)  He was a theatre major at a midwestern university, and may or may not have graduated.  He is fifteen grand in debt and wears two hundred dollar jeans.  And for the next two hours he is in line next to me talking about himself, girls that he’s had sex with, and what he’ll do when he’s famous.  He begins every sentence with “Bro, I was like...”  And there is a weird look on his face, and a tone and cadence in his voice that alternates back and fourth between sounding like he wants to fight me and sounding like he wants to kiss me.</p>
<p>Finally I would walk into a room where a casting director would lean over and  mutter “too skinny, not enough muscle,” to some guy wearing cargo pants, and a far too tacoed, factory-faded baseball cap, just before saying to me, “Thank you, next.” Nick Black would say “Better luck next time, bro.” as I walked out. I would see him at the next audition spitting all the same “game” to someone else.  </p>
<p>I liked modeling jobs better.  My excuse for an agency would send out pictures, and sometimes, I would get a phone call.  With modeling I usually only had to deal with people if I got the job.  I was getting enough little modeling jobs to make rent and support a budding alcoholic lifestyle.</p>
<p>You wouldn’t know it from my smiling face, frozen in time, with one hand in my pocket, blankly staring out at my grandmother’s kitchen from a Sears ad stuck to her refrigerator, but I felt more depressed and hopeless than ever. I sat in my empty bathtub, smoked cigarettes and imagined another life until my beer was empty.  People that occasionally model Dockers Stain Defender pants don’t fuck exotic models.  I felt stuck in a revolving cycle of waiting for nothing, which wasn’t new but I used to have Annie to make me help prescribe meaning to my life.  She was afraid of making me feel stuck, or trapped, so she let me leave.  What a sweetheart.  I don’t think she realized how smart her decision was, and yet, how foolish her reasons for making it were .  The only hard work was getting up in the morning.  The only thing inspiring is that I didn’t kill myself.</p>
<p>Some might call what happened next inspiring, I chalk it up to dumb luck.  But maybe I’m a pessimist.  I got a phone call from my agent.  A while back, I had done a session with a the fine art photographer Ivan Mendel.  Mendel was featured in Photo magazine a few months later, with one of his pictures of me making the cover.  The cover shot caught the eye of fashion designer Frederico Vespucci.  My agent was ecstatic when she told me about how Vespucci contacted her, and how she talked me up to Vespucci while showing him my portfolio.  My slimy, mostly useless agent wouldn’t let me forget her role in getting Vespucci to be considering me as the male face of his brand.  My agent said “Frederico says that your body has a delicate strength, and that your face looks as though you are so tortured by the world, yet introspective and so detached from it,” or some bullshit like that.  All that mattered was that I was getting this job and my agent was getting her cut.  My agency then more or less sold me to a larger, more legitimate agency in New York.  I was an L.A. success story, maybe dumb luck is inspiring after all.  As my plane left the tarmac of LAX and climbed above the brown shitosphere of smog, I remember thinking “Ok God, I’m out of here, so go ahead, unleash the big one, let the ground open up and Los Angeles fall into Hell where it belongs. </p><br><br>

<p>I had spent months looking over my grandmother’s kitchen from a sears ad, smiling and wearing clothes I would never wear in real life. Now, a few months after the call, I was overlooking Times Square from a Vespucci billboard, pouting and wearing clothes that I once thought were garish and expensive.  I stood there in the center of Times Square, at the center of the world staring at a billboard with myself staring back at me, and thought about that asshole Aidan Lane from the auditions.  For a moment, I pictured him in some new line telling someone that he knew me, but soon stopped and scolded myself for even thinking about that prick.  </p>
<p>I had been in New York for almost a month and this was the first time I had been to Times Square.  I hadn’t had any time to sight see.  The days were filled with shooting schedules and meetings with my agent.  The nights were filled with industry parties, and club hopping with my new friends.  Any days I had off, I spent buying and then arranging clever, expensive furniture in my clever, expensive Greenwich Village apartment.  I thought today I would spend the day to myself.  And so there I was in Times Square and only thing I cared to see was me.  Mostly because I had become a self-important dickweed, but I told myself it was just because Times Square sucks.  </p>
<p>Where there was once a ticker tape celebration with an infamous kiss, and then a geographic caricature of seedy strip clubs and peepshows, there was now the same old shit as everywhere else, just grander. A big Chile's restaurant, a multiple story Olive Garden, a huge Toys R’ Us.  Twenty years ago you went to Times Square to get hand jobs, cheap thrills, and mugged,  now you go to Times Square to get a blooming onion, a TRL key chain, and see a guy play guitar in his underwear.</p>
<p>I abandoned the more traditional tourist sights for the sights that I wanted to see.  I took a cab to east 33rd st. and saw Warhol's last Factory.  I went down to Bowery to CBGB then to the deli that was once Max’s Kansas City, and had a prosciutto sandwich.  I sat there eating my sandwich sarcastically wondering if anyone, anywhere, was looking at my picture in a Vespucci ad, and thinking, “I’ll bet this guy is in a deli on the lower east side eating a sandwich, thinking about Andy Warhol and the early days of punk music.”  Nobody was.  The sandwich was the good, but every where that I had gone was just as dead as time’s Square.  Warhol’s Factory on 33rd was just a building that he had lived in after he had made it big.  CBGB’s was just a hole in the wall that reeked of piss and had a rich history.  And where Max’s Kansas City was once the hangout of Andy Warhol, Lou Reed, and everyone else that Warhol made famous for fifteen minutes in the late 60’s and early 70’s, it was now just a deli.  I finished my sandwich and took a cab to the Empire State building.</p>
<p>It was strange to view the city from so high up.  If you can put on headphones, ignore the tourists, and aren't terrified of hights, it’s almost peaceful.  While others were taking photographs and harboring low-level fears of planes crashing into the building, I was looking down at the city, with the sort of detachment that a more human God might feel.  At the top, taking in the vista of human achievement, I felt detached from, and yet connected to, the world.  Everybody was going somewhere, with individual thoughts, purposes, fears, worries, hopes.  As I stood there in the sky, I felt so far away from the world, that I started to see all these people, their motivations, this building, this city, myself, as though it were all merely a snapshot in the time.  I imagined somebody twenty five-hundred years ago, overlooking Athens and feeling the same way. I imagined what might make someone feel this way twenty five-hundred years from now.  For the next forty-eight minutes and fifty-two seconds I listened to Andy Warhol by the Velvet Underground and enjoyed the piece of mind, of knowing that with enough time, nothing is really that important.  The next day I would be on a flight to Paris for Fashion Week, and wouldn’t think like this anymore.</p><br><br>

<p>I like clothes all right, but the face of Vespucci has never really seen fashion as a true art form.  At best fashion is visually pleasing and functional, but in the end only as interesting or important as who’s wearing it.  Imagine if somebody were to look at a Picasso and say “That’s so last year,” but maybe I just don’t get it.  So I felt kind of kind of out of place at Fashion Week.  But, always the professional, I looked good, maintained a smile, made safe jokes, and pretended that I thought people were as great as they thought they were. </p>
<p>The next day was all rehearsals. Who knew me and nine others walking down a run way in three different outfits was such a production. The third day was the Vespucci Haute Couture show.  There was a short video before the show, a mini documentary style with Vespucci talking about how the designs in this show were inspired by home movies he found of him and his parents traveling Europe in the sixties.  From back stage I could hear him briefly mention me in the video.  “At his first shoot I could see that he had something, thoughts and energy leftover from a time that he never new, he was the past and the future all at once.”  The truth is, I was nervous and had thoughts of sleeping with the girl I was posing with.  But Vespucci wouldn’t know that, he wasn’t at my first shoot.  The video wrapped up, and Vespucci walked out onto the runway to a parted sea of applause, said a few words and on with the show.  Meanwhile I was backstage politely declining to be fluffed by some guy with an ear piece. I was the last to walk out. </p>
<p>Don’t listen to what anybody tells you, walking down a runway is easy. The trick is confidence.  It’s the quick changes, long hours, the waiting, the anxiety, expectations, and the guilt of feeling partly responsible for numerous cases of anorexia and bulimia that are tedious. But most who complain have never had a real job.  At this level models are adequately compensated, so it was just best to shut up. I did my three looks perfectly and walked out with Vespucci and everyone else to a hail of applause.</p>
<p>That night, Vespucci held a party on the Eiffel Tower.  I was leaning with my arms on the railing overlooking the lights of Paris. I began to feel similar to how I felt at the Empire state building, but had to stop and take a picture with somebody.  This was no the time to be alone with my thoughts, nor did I want it to be.  I picked up a bottle.  I mingled.  I said my hellos, my good byes, and my thank yous, and left two hours later with two bottles of expensive wine and a model named Ludmila.</p><br><br>

<p>Back at my five start hotel room, I felt as in a strange recurring dream.  The kind of dream that is familiar, yet void of the comfort that familiarity usually brings.  Deja vu suddenly hit me like a train, exploding me into a pink mist of guilt and regret, as I sat there half under the covers, with my back against a pillow, against the head board, of a minimalist bed.  I was in my fantasy, but the things so easy to forget in a daydream present themselves in a night terror.  I looked over at Ludmila’s slender body, bathed in the pale yellow light of the wall sconce.  She looked so soft as she laid there awkwardly, asleep like a ravaged corpse.  I tried to block out the fact that she was just barely seventeen.  Cocaine was on my minimalist dresser, the cd player was skipping, my head hurt, and my index finger was still crooked.  I got out of bed as quickly as I could while still conscious not to wake up the naked little girl next to me.  I grabbed one of the two bottles of wine I had stolen from the party, just before leaving with a girl who is now in my bed, sleeping in her make up.  I put on my jeans that were too expensive and walked out onto the balcony.  The air was cold and jarring but felt appropriate, I lit a cigarette and hoped the wine would keep me warm, because I didn’t feel worthy of a jacket.  </p>
<p>This hotel, this supposed fantasy, there was a time like this once before, but better.  I was with a beautiful girl from the Ukraine name Anastasia.  We stayed up all night laughing, loving, and drinking wine.  She was one year my junior. There was no guilt, no regret, only peaceful happiness.  We woke up the next morning there was no awkward good byes, instead she told me to stay in bed and brought me breakfast from a cafe down the street.  We would stare at each other's eyes and smile.  It was our one year anniversary.  There were emotions that cannot effectively be put into words.  Once you have loved, lost, and loved someone new so much that you think your original idea of love was childish and stupid, you might get a glimpse, but will probably fail to recognize it until is gone.  </p>
<p>Time, familiarity, and laziness had abbreviated Anastasia to merely Annie.  Arrogance, narcissism, and neglect had abbreviated a wonderful person into merely my girlfriend.  I had been to preoccupied with dreams of being somewhere else to see where I was.  She used to comfort me when I would get depressed like this.  		Ashes fell from the cigarette in my shivering hand, down to the street four stories below like ominous snowflakes, I stood there ignoring my living dream, to lament the ignored joys of my past.  Anastasia was now nothing but a memory to me.  Like CBGB, Max’s Kansas City, the Factory, there is only the shadow of what once was.  If I even tried to go back nothing would be the same.  I wished desperately that I could go back in time, and hold on to just one moment and never let it go, have it just repeat, forever.  But all I could do was hope that Anastasia was happy where ever she was, whoever she had become. I hoped that whoever she was with loved her as much as I should have.  Cold and alone I cried on that balcony in Paris, reaping the spoils of trying to live a life without regret.</p><br><br>

<p>I swallowed the last nasty gulp of beer, and stubbed out my cigarette against the stucco wall of my parents’ house.  I gladly awoke from this orgy of the destopic.    I went back inside, cleaned my room and invited Anastasia over.  We laid in bed for hours, I told her how much I loved her, and she told me to never forget it. As we held each other tight and drifted off to sleep, I noticed that I was smiling.  I had accomplished something.</p><br><br>
