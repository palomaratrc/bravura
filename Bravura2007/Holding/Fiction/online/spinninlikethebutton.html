<center><b>Spinnin’ Like the Button on a Outhouse Door</b><br>
By Jack Mawhinney</center><br><br>

<p>We took off from the Riverside Airport at 7am in a small Bell two-seat helicopter heading for the San Bernardino Mountains and a photo assignment. The pilot , a red-haired, freckle-faced, thirty-two year old, wearing khaki pants, a white dress shirt open at the neck under a leather flight jacket, and a World War II vintage crushed cap, responded to the wind bursts with an easy hand, looking for other aircraft in the vicinity, monitoring the instruments, and reporting conditions to the airport tower left behind. Climbing out of the ground fog at one thousand feet a blast of wind rocked the helicopter from side to side. The pilot‘s eyebrows lifted, his lips pressed into a thin straight line, and took a firmer hold on the controls.</p>
<p>It was obvious that he did not anticipate a Santana wind storm. We were obliged to fly over Cajon Pass and as we approached the mountains the winds took on the ferocity of a true Santana of 60 and 70 mph winds, causing the aircraft to lurch sideways while at the same time suddenly dropping thirty feet, as if through the gallows floor triggered by the hangman. </p>
<p>The pilot’s hands and feet were in constant movement directing the controls in response to the roiling winds.  It was necessary for him to cut back the engine rpm to offset every vacuum pocket created by wind gusts in order to avoid the danger of losing or damaging the rotors. But there was a secondary threat just as dangerous; if the pilot over-reacted, the engine would kill and the helicopter would lose the stabilizing power of an operating engine. </p>
<p>The Santana won. The engine shut down at 9000 feet. The helicopter assumed a 35% glide, rotors silently windmillimg toward freeway traffic traveling on the Cajon Pass 3000 feet below. The pilot turned with a bravura pose (betrayed by a tic in his left eye) as if to reassure that the engine would restart quickly. The first try failed. The second try failed. Our speed picked up. The ground came up at a disconcerting speed. Sweat beaded up and trickled out from under the pilot’s crushed hat and down the back of his neck. </p>
<p>He worked even faster, repeatedly pressing the start button (stalled by too much fuel), hands and feet flailing the controls; and finally despite the brief panic, the engine caught at 300 feet, the craft leveled out, the pilot regained his composure, and without a word we headed back to Riverside Airport to the nearest bathroom; estimated arrival time 7:55am.</p>
