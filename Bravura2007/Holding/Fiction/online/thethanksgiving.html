<center><b>The Thanksgiving Dinner</b><br>
By Richard Mills</center><br><br>

<p>Ralph and Susan had been married 48 years and were looking forward to their 50th anniversary when Ralph was killed. The couple had four children and five grand children. Ralph, who was a tall, reedy guy, was 75 but had always been healthy. He jogged three and a half miles, 5 days a week, and complimented this with chin-ups, push-ups and various yoga exercises. Susan, who was 65, but still a slim cute woman, was very careful about their diets, consequently their cholesterol levels were quite acceptable. So with all this background, why did Ralph get run over by a bus?… Because he wasn’t looking.</p><br><br>

<p>They called Susan and she ran to the accident site and clutched Ralph’s bleeding head and went into hysterics. Ralph was not dead…He was alive… He would always be with her…She would not leave him!</p>
<p>And she would not. She stayed with him in the ambulance and at the mortuary. It was terrible to see her clutching Ralph’s dead body as they prepared him for the funeral. Finally Susan collapsed from exhaustion and her children were able to get her home for some rest. But she was still shaking with emotion. Ralph would not leave her!</p>
<p>The children were trying to prepare some food and they discovered the freezer had thawed out and all the meat was spoiled. Unfortunately this news reached Susan, but instead of increasing her anxiety, it seemed to calm her with another problem to solve. She told her oldest son, Marvin, to order another freezer from Sears. The old one had been giving problems and needed to be replaced. Marvin, who had never married, was heavy set, strong, and a tad retarded. He was very close to his mother.	</p>
<p>The next day was the wake and the following day was the funeral. Susan bore up quite well until the end of the wake. She insisted on staying with Ralph’s remains all through the night. The funeral home did not like that idea, but finally agreed provided they could seal the casket. Susan and Marvin assented and they spent the night grieving next to their loved one. Surprisingly, the next day Susan would not attend the funeral. She was too exhausted. Marvin however stayed with the casket until it had been lowered into the ground. He did not let any one touch it.</p><br><br>

<p>Ralph was killed the day before Thanksgiving and Susan lamented that he missed his turkey and pumpkin pie. Ralph always carved a pumpkin for Halloween and then cut it up so Susan could make several fresh pies. Not this year. The pumpkin meat was carefully stored in the new Sears freezer along with the turkey and other things for the dinner. The oldest daughter looked into the new freezer and commented on how full it already was.</p>
<p>The year went by and Susan and her family survived. Ralph had left a good account of their investments, and Susan’s two sons helped straighten out the finances. It turned out they did not have to sell the big house on the lake and it appeared Susan could live there comfortably the rest of her life. Every one was amazed at Susan’s demeanor. She actually seemed relieved that Ralph was gone. But she worried her children with constant talk of joining Ralph; in other words she soon was going to die. But in fact her health was good, she continued a strenuous exercise program and she had a good appetite.</p>
<p>Christmas came and went and Susan did little to help her daughters with the celebration. She talked a lot about joining Ralph and she was looking forward to the following Thanksgiving even though it was 11 months away.</p>
<p>As the year went by, Susan seemed to be dreaming. She talked incessantly about what she would prepare for the Thanksgiving dinner, would the food be what Ralph really wanted? Her children shook their heads and gradually spent less time with her. They had families of their own to worry about. Susan’s only companion was her sister, Adrian, who had recently divorced, and also needed comfort.</p><br><br>

<p>As Thanksgiving approached, Susan became more and more agitated. She prepared and then changed the menu several times. Finally Adrian said, “What Ralph always liked was turkey, corn bread dressing, sweet potatoes, brussel sprouts, and a jello salad.That’s it, no more and no less.” Then Susan exclaimed, “And pie! He loved pumpkin and mince-meat pie! Mince-meat was for Christmas but I will make one special for Thanksgiving!”  Adrian knew that Susan was expecting Ralph to be at the dinner, even if only in her dreams.</p>
<p>The day arrived and the entire family gathered around the big table, except the head chair which was left empty for Ralph. They all held hands and prayed. Susan, with tears streaming down her cheeks, sobbed, “Oh Ralph, I made this all for you. You were taken from us last year, but now you are here! I just know it, so please enjoy it all, especially the mince meat pie. I don't think I will ever make another one. Soon we will be together. I love you Ralph; it has been so comforting to have had your presence this last year. Now let us all thank the Lord for our family and this wonderful day of Thanksgiving.”</p>
<p>During the meal Susan insisted on retelling some of Ralph’s jokes, like, ‘How does a wife deal with her husband’s strange personality?’ Answer: ‘Total submission!’ All of this went over the heads of the family; they shook their heads again and resumed eating like a bunch of starved lions. Susan realized she was alone in her fantasy so she finally kept quiet. The only thing she ate was a big piece of mince-meat pie. After everyone had belched with some fresh coffee, Adrian decided the grandchildren needed some ice cream on their pie and so she went out to the freezer. Then the family were startled by a scream from the laundry room where the freezer was located. Marvin got up quickly and went to see what was wrong. He saw what was wrong and quickly closed the lid of the freezer. Adrian was clutching her chest and she had turned white. Marvin motioned for her to be silent and then helped her back into the dining room.</p>
<p>The rest looked expectantly at Marvin and Adrian, waiting for some explanation. Marvin suggested that the grandchildren go play in the yard. They all giggled and ran out. Susan who had turned gray in the face, probably from eating too much mince-meat pie, which she was not that fond of, said softly, “I will save Adrian the embarrassment of explaining our little secret…After the old freezer failed, I had Marvin buy a new horizontal freezer, extra long. We stayed with Ralph after the wake, broke the seal on the casket, and with great difficulty, using Marvin’s pick-up truck, we moved Ralph’s body to the new freezer here at home. The next day the pall bearers were suspicious that the seal had been broken, and the casket was a little light, but Marvin paid them something…I kept Ralph well covered with food, but every so often I would reveal his frozen face and give him a kiss. It was all that kept me going. Don’t you see, I could not live without him!…</p>
<p>“So today, being his Thanksgiving, I decided to reveal him and leave the lid open, so he could hear our prayers and enjoy the meal with the rest of us…But now it is time that I join Ralph. Marvin will arrange for both of us to be buried together. There will not be another wake, only a graveside ceremony…”</p>
<p>Susan’s last words were with a gasp; she was having a stroke, probably from stress and indigestion. However she staggered up and went to the freezer with her son’s help. She knelt down in front of her beloved husband and died quietly.</p><br><br>
