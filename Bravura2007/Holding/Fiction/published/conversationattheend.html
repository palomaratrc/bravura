<center><b>Conversation at the End of the Street</b><br>
By Henrik Harbin<br><br></center>

<p>The afternoon sun winks a reddish-orange eye in my direction as I limp down the dusty, apathetic sidewalk.  At least I was smart to snatch this coat off that corpse last week, I think; the wind is picking up, blowing old newspapers across my path. San Francisco never really gets warm anymore, and the dust clouds don’t help much. </p>
<p>Groups of two, three, and sometimes as many as four people drag themselves along the walk.  Doorways, the ones that aren’t smashed to splinters, are either boarded shut or crossed with thick iron bars, coated mostly with layers of rust as thick and unappetizing as month-old salsa.  The few signs that remain above the doorways have so many holes eaten through them by rust and time that they haven’t been read in… oh, shit, ages, I guess. The street itself reeks of age, pain, and wasted bio-diesel. The dead dinosaurs and petrified memories of wontons in the air wash everything with a bored blackish-gray dust.  I think most of it was air, once. Crap.  My soul for a smoke…</p>
<p>Some of the passersby – the ones with shifting eyes that still work, and faces not blurred by keloids or flash scars -- glare enviously at me.  They want my pack, or my stick.  The pack is a worn bookbag with a zipper on it that I’ve repaired oh, shit, must be half a million times before fucking off and forgetting the whole idea.  Today it holds a few survivalist diversions:  a whetstone for my stick (stolen from a long-dead Cuisine-Plus shop); a coverless copy of Dr. Bloodmoney, and a damp, partially shredded paperback of obsolete Japanese curses (this is supposed to be “Japantown”, after all); a cloth-wrapped packet of week-old rat meat that I really should throw away.  I might get hungrier though. At least the last couple cans from the sixer of last-rate beer will try to wash it down. Hmph.</p>
<p>I heft my stick, and the shadows back off.  A long time ago, in someone else’s life, it was a simple cane. Since finding it, I’ve added a long blade from what must’ve been a broken Army knife, and a handful of rusted nails pounded in close to that end; the other end, clutched in my four fingered right “hand”, is a tape-wrapped rubber grip. The last kid who tried to snatch it—a thin, pale, tattooed teenager with bleeding yellow eyes--   got a faceful of personal problems; in exchange, he ripped my thigh through my jeans with what looked to be steel fingernails.  Come to think of it, he was the only one who’s tried messing with me so far. </p>
<p>Oh god.  I’ve got to stop a second.  I lean against a flamed-out building that might have once been a small rooming house, reading a badly spelled version of a dirty limerick scrawled on a fence across the street.  I gasp in enough of this evil black shit to make me cough up another bloody tooth.  Something brushes me.  Pills, of course, might’ve helped, but the last pharmacy was buried with the rest of civilization, about thirty or forty years ago. And with the environment all shot to hell, I’d be a fool to try mushrooms or the other few plants that barely manage to grow around here. </p>
<p>Something brushes me; I jump out of my skin.</p>
<p>“Hey, Mister—you okay?”</p>
<p>I come back to myself.  The speaker is in a busted barf-green baby carriage, being pushed by an ancient man who looks like the bastard son of a desiccated prune and a naked mole rat.  I look closer, and I see it’s probably a girl; sounds like one anyway.</p>
<p>“I said, are you okay?” Yup, it’s definitely a girl.  She’s young, maybe seven or eight, with almost no scarring.  I wouldn’t say perfect—who in the name of St. Condoleezza is perfect these days? —But she does look rather more human than a lot of us.   The baldness doesn’t hurt her looks much, but she’s pale as an onion. Scar tissue across her face has left her, oh god, with no nose to speak of, and her teeth are just worn stumps.  She smiles up at me from her seat. Her eyes are like huge almonds, with dark patches where the pupils should be.  The whites of those eyes are blue – as blue as the dirty little hoodie she has on—and faintly smeared with traces of red from broken blood vessels.  She’s blind, of course.  </p>
<p>Something about her stuns me, in a strangely calming way.</p>
<p>“Uncle Wataru saw you from down the street. I thought I could … help you?”  I start to laugh, cough up a little of something red, and stop.  She seems so … earnest.  Hopeful, even.  Uncle Wataru reaches into his   front pocket and pulls out a worn but reasonably clean blue hankie.  “Hai, dozo,” he says, in a whisper that speaks of silken-winged dragons and spice-scented mists, and time, and hope...</p>
<p>I wave him off.  “Arigato, no.  I’m afraid that nothing’s in time to help me now.”  My face is suddenly moist.</p>
<p>He nods, pocketing the hankie, leaning close to his niece as she whispers to him in simple but fast Japanese. He looks at me questioningly.  What does this old fart want now, I wonder?  </p>
<p>“I’m Emi, by the way.”  Her smile is still there.  “My uncle calls me ‘tenshi-chan’.” </p>
<p>I know enough Japanese, from living around here, to know that tenshi is one word for angel.  I don’t see any wings or halo, but this cute kid still wears that nickname like she’s owned it all her short life.  I smile at her.  I know she can’t see my flash scars, my stitched-shut eye, or the broken blisters on my forehead, but at this moment I feel as if she really sees me.</p>
<p>“Pleased to meet you, Emi.  I’m Michael.”  I reach out and touch her shoulder, gently. She’s warm, but not feverishly so.  How the hell can she not be sick, not be dead, in this boneless and sleepwalking world we killed so long ago?</p>
<p>“I, um… have something for you,” Emi says. “Will you accept it?”</p>
<p>I’m hesitant.    “Emi, I’m sure that your gift could help someone el—“</p>
<p>“No.”  I’ve never heard a kid this young use the word no with such force, without bawling her eyes out.  “This is for you.  Michael Taylor.”  For the first time, her smile is gone, as if it had never existed; in its place is a look of blank seriousness.</p>
<p>Huh?  “How did you—“  </p>
<p>“This is for you, Michael.  I want to help.  Accept it.  Please?” Now I can hear the youth in her again, the insistence, fighting hard against her calmness.</p>
<p>Deep breath—cough—deep breath.  I nod before I remember her blindness.  Uncle Wataru moves next to her, his mummy-like, veiled eyes shining.  In all of my forty-nine years in this blighted world, I don’t think I’ve ever felt this tense.</p>
<p>“Okay, Tenshi-chan.  I don’t know what you have in mind, but, hell, I’m ready.”</p>
<p>She looks to him again, smiling, and says “Now, Uncle.”   She lifts her arms, revealing three-fingered hands with long, sharp nails, the color of thin onionskin.   </p>
<p>Bending painfully, he reaches into the green carriage, lifting Emi out as if she’s made of snowflakes.   She has no legs.  </p>
<p>She reaches for me as he approaches me.  I think about using my stick, but I change my mind, dropping it and letting it fall to the dirty pavement.  “Good idea,” she says into my ear.  Her breath, gentle, feathery, sends me hints of ginger and dragonsmoke. “I can’t help hurting you a little bit, but you’ll be okay soon.  I promise.”</p>
<p>Her nails pierce my neck.  The pain blinds me.  I stagger slightly and collapse against the building. “I—“</p>
<p>“Shh, Michael.  Rest now.  You’ll sleep, and then you’ll wake up, hungry. Stay away from garlic, okay?  And a good sun block will help.”  Uncle Wataru lifts Emi from my neck.  Waving, she smiles that sweet, calm smile.  Her cheeks glow a gentle rosy pink. The sun’s angry eye has long since closed, but as she leaves, the angel lends some of her light to a world that needs it as much as I did.  Her unseen wings enfold me now, rocking me to sleep.</p>
<p>I’m more tired than I’ve ever been, but—something is different now.  Drifting into dark slumber, I realize what I’m feeling.</p>
<p>Emi—Tenshi-chan-- has been my destroying angel, yes … but she’s also made good on her promise.  She’s given me a gift—no, a trade-off.  </p>
<p>I’ll have to be especially careful, like she said; garlic has too much iron for me now, and likewise, the sun blasts out too much vitamin D— I’d roast like a pile of leaves. The stuff that everybody’s read about crosses, holy water, and so on is bullshit, of course.  Coffins? Hah!  Don’t make me laugh. Kid stuff.  </p>
<p>Guess I can finally toss out that rat meat.  I’ve gotta go “shopping” before too much competition shows up.</p>
<p>Slowly, I stretch my arms out, and I realize something; the ache in my bones and the throb in my leg wound are… gone.  Undoing the wrappings on my leg, I see a long white line where there once was a jagged, weeping tear.</p>
<p>I flex my hand; the cauterization scar is still there, but I doubt that bone cancer will ever be a serious problem for me again. </p>
<p>Looking around, I notice an intact door in the building I was leaning against.  The dust-smothered sign on it hangs by just two nails now, but I can still read it, and it makes me laugh in irony.  Somehow, I don’t think the people who started this chapter of the Salvation Army expected someone like me to show up here.   The warmth and darkness are comfortable, and quiet; I’ll need to do a little fixing up here and there, but at least I have a secure place to live until I have to move on.  And I will have to leave eventually; some idiots with torches and stakes might hear about me.  I can’t have that.  </p>
<p>As I start the long cleanup process, I surprise myself by actually humming to myself as I dust off tables, moving chairs and clearing a place to sleep away from the window.   Yeah!  This is going to be my kind of place!</p>
<p>For the first time in my life, there is no pain.</p><br><br>
