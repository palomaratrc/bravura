<center><b>Evening Rain</b><br>
By Eric B. Smith</center><br><br>


<p>Stone paths winding about the old shrine, laced with memories of a long forgotten past, echoes resonating with each drop of rain. Upon these paths Mamori now strode, taking advantage of the cherry trees branches which caught the rain as it fell, an umbrella for the wayward student.</p>
<p>Beneath one of the older sakura trees, Mamori's hand caressed a stream of water as it flowed by, its current sweeping the fallen foliage along on its chaotic journey. His eyes caught sight of one leaf in particular, deep green save the browning edges, dancing as it was dragged through currents and rapids, no control over its eventual fate. Continuing on his own journey, Mamori grasped his satchel, heaving the load upon his shoulder. Thrown suddenly off balance, a few moments of frenzied waving of arms relieved the situation.  </p>
<p>Bright red Torii marked the shrine's entrance, their twin upright supports and crossbars across the top evidently repainted since he had last seen them, and twin fox sentinels kept guard with gray eyes. Meandering past the stone guards, Mamori circled about the holy grounds, rain now a soft mist against his cheek. His elliptical journey around the shrine came to an end before the temple, which was set off from the shrine by just under a hundred yards. </p>
<p>Inside, a pair of miko--shrine maidens-- tended to the temple grounds, apparently not yet aware of his presence.  He would be sure to scold them later as they had obviously skimped on their lessons during his latest excursion, otherwise they would have known a spirit had crossed over the temple’s holy barrier.  Both were adorned in the traditional chihaya, composed of a scarlet hakama and a white kimono, their long sleeves swaying as they went about cleaning the aged wood.</p>
<p>A sharp wind came from the paths above, pulling off the paling scarf which Mamori had been keeping loosely draped about his shoulders, carrying it off back down the trail.  Dropping the satchel, he raced after it.</p>
<p>The scarf lies for a moment upon a sacred stone, laced with Shimenawa, the straw rope covered with zigzagging paper, darkened with moisture. A drop of dew struck the stone, the spray glistening despite the clouds. Peering above, Mamori’s eyes observed the old cherry tree which had served as the drop’s harvester. It was under this tree that he had made a promise to a young girl.  His mind strayed back to that day, seven years ago...</p>
<p>She stood before him now, her normally bright and gleeful deep blue eyes now laced with concern.</p>
<p>“Why did you want to come here Renna? The festival is about to start.”  Mamori’s younger self strode toward the girl, arms crossed in faux annoyance.  The young girl turned to face the sakura tree before speaking, the shifting of her summer yukata giving its butterfly print an almost lifelike quality.</p>
<p>“Are you really going to be leaving again?”</p>
<p>Mamori’s gaze shifted to the tree, following the leaves as the wind brushed past them. “That is my intention.”</p>
<p>“But you’ll come back, right?” They could both hear the summer wind as it rattled the leaves above, neither moving, eyes fixed upon the tree.</p>
<p>‘Well?!” The girl’s voice had become almost shrill, a tone Mamori had never heard her use before.  Vexed by this sudden change in her, his only thought was to say something that would sate his friend.</p>
<p>“Fine, fine, I’ll come back.” Shifting her gaze from the tree to Mamori she takes a step towards him, entwining her pinkie finger around his.  “Promise me.”  With a sigh Mamori, now tired of this strange irrationality, tried to put an end to it.</p>
<p>“Okay, I promise to come back.  Now let’s go, they’re about to start.”  Taking her hand in his, Mamori dragged the girl up the trail towards the light of the festival's hanging lanterns... </p>
<p>“GAH!”</p>
<p>A drop of rain snaked its way down Mamori’s back, an icy chill following in its wake, bringing him back to the present. Suddenly remembering why he was on the old path, he made a dash for the scarf, only to have it caught up in yet another gust of wind and carried further down the trail.</p>
<p>Coming upon one of the area’s many bridges, Mamori saw another of the temple’s miko standing on the old wooden platform, watching the water as it flowed beneath her.  Turning in his direction, her slender hand reached out as the scarf fell gently into its expecting grasp. The young woman examined the cloth with reminiscent eyes, her long brown hair swaying in the breeze.  Mamori froze for a moment, shocked to see his old friend.</p>
<p>Raising her umbrella to allow for his height, Renna wrapped the scarf around Mamori’s neck, taking care that it was placed under the hood of his jacket.  “It is good to have you home, Mamori.”</p>
<p>Now back in the old temple, Mamori sat down with Shiro, the head priest.  Letting out a hearty laugh, Shiro used the hand not occupied by the saucer of sake to drag Mamori next to him, his face flushed from what Mamori knew to be a bit too much alcohol.  </p>
<p>Renna kneeled beside Mamori, offering him a steaming cup of tea.  Taking the tea with a smile, Mamori turned back toward Shiro, continuing their conversation of Mamori’s various jobs since he had left roughly a year ago.   Chucking, Mamori took a sip of his tea, the warm earthy aroma filling his senses.  “Well then, it’s getting late and I still need to unpack, so I’ll be heading home.”  Rising, Mamori pulled his satchel from the ground. Turning his head curiously as Renna stood as well.  “I’ll go with you; your house is not too far past mine anyway.”</p>
<p>A moonlit night hung over them, the streets still smelt of the day’s rain, the light from the street lamps glistening upon the moist pavement.</p>
<p>“And here I was hoping the rain would continue.” Mamori said slyly.</p>
<p>“That’s just because you want me to share my umbrella with you.” Renna teased.  A hint of scarlet arose in Mamori’s cheeks, turning his face to the park which bordered his old home.</p>
<p>“It seems you’ll get your rain in an hour or so anyway.”  Renna motioned to the east, thick black storm clouds visible despite the night.</p>
<p>“Well here I am.”  Renna paused at the entrance to her home, which was made with traditional Japanese architecture in mind. Since he was still peering at the storm clouds in the distance, Renna’s sudden embrace startles him, her arms locked around his torso, head resting upon his shoulder. “It really is good to have you back, Mamo-kun.”</p>
<p>Breaking away, she opened the gate to her house, looking back with smile and a wave before disappearing behind the large wall of shrubbery bordering the property line, leaving Mamori a bit confused.</p>
<p>A deep sigh brought a smile back to his face as his eyes trailed back to the distant storm clouds.  “It is good to be home.”</p>
