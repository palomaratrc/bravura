<center><b>Offshore</b><br>
<i>First Place Winner, Fiction</i><br>
By Michael Burge</center><br><br>

<p>Tim’s feet carried him to the river and pulled him down without slowing. Water crept up his legs, towards his groin, and stopped midway at his stomach. He felt jagged icy fingers seep through his skin. They clutched at his insides. </p>
<p>He leaned sideways into the bullying current.  His right leg dug into the thick sand. He struggled for breaths. He didn’t know if he was going to make it.</p>
<p>The tangled pile of branches and rocks were just a few steps ahead.</p><br><br>

<p>Tim had discovered the island while walking along the river that morning. He found a shallow spot of water in which to cross. As he stepped into the icy water he felt his lulled thigh muscles clench like dry sponges. </p>
<p>He hurried through and made it to the island, grateful for warm sand. He surveyed the land as his legs absorbed the heat. Scattered along the glinting pale sand were small stones and branches. Tim noted that the island looked like a curved teardrop, turning with the contour of the river. One leafless oak tree sprouted from the dry hot earth. He walked along the shore, feeling the sand tickle the bottoms of his bare feet. He listened to the sound of the pounding water roll around him.</p>
<p>A pale green ranger truck glided over the stone bridge up river, sound drowned by the heaving rapids that a slight decline produced at the tip of the island. The arch of the bridge framed bright spots that were children splashing in the water far in the distance. He had yet to share his clump of land with anyone. Not even his father, alone at camp, knew of Tim’s discovery.</p>
<p>He was feeling hungry and was about to step back into the river when two boys carrying fishing poles crossed the bridge. He stopped. He turned and walked to the oak stretching desperately towards the forest across the river. He sat down against the thin trunk, barely thicker than his hairless legs bent in the sun. He was as still as the hot heavy air around him. </p>
<p>Tim watched the two boys weave through the thick pines down to the shaded bank. They stopped directly opposite Tim’s island. He wondered if they could see him. Leaning forward he ignored his hollow stomach as the taller of the young men, limbs trying to escape his body, set down a green tackle box and began to rummage through it. </p>
<p>Tim studied the shorter of the two– the one that stood like the granite cliffs rising above the pines. Tim leaned back on his lanky white arms burning in the sun. </p>
<p>The boy lifted his fishing pole and held it vertical between bare knees, tying a hook to the line, careful concentration. His brown hair slanted across his forehead and ended in waves that curled around his ears. </p>
<p>Tim squinted at his square shadowed face. How old could he be? Fifteen, sixteen? To Tim that was a stretch of time longer than the shadows cast by the giant pines above them.</p>
<p>He watched the boy flick the baited line into the river. From the corner of Tim’s eye the boy’s friend was a blur standing several yards upstream. Tim followed the flickering light on the boy’s line as it was carried out of the shadows down river. He watched the boy’s hand lock the reel. Tim tapped his feet in unison with the vibrating line. He caught the boy’s shadowed eyes slide casually in his direction and Tim looked away with ambivalence, fixing his stare downstream. Tim couldn’t hear his own deep sighs over the continuous roar of the small rapids, like static on video. </p>
<p>His head stayed on the river but his eyes rolled back to the boy. He dug his fingers deep into the sand and clenched his fists. He felt the gritty hot grains cling to his soft palms. He watched spots of sun penetrate the shade through the trees and strike the boy’s long brown hair with gold. The boy lifted his t-shirt and ran his fingers over his tanned belly. </p>
<p>Tim’s stomach jolted up like an empty elevator.</p>
<p>The boy stood s-curved, rolling his head backwards, side to side, exposing the small jut under his neck. Tim’s insides pooled with a humid flood of longing. He felt for his own Adam’s apple but it wasn’t there yet. Grits of sand stuck to his neck like stubble. The dark pines coolly framed the boy from behind, standing as calmly and surely as he did. </p>
<p>Tim got up to do what he wasn’t going to do before. </p>
<p>He struggled with each stone, wobbling to the river, gently placing them one on the other in two rows. He was careful not to drop the rocks so as not to scare off any fish. A foreign sound like a rock falling in the water could be picked up by fish over rapids, right? Tim didn’t take chances.</p>
<p>The melted snow that pummeled from the mountains miles away stabbed his feet but he didn’t notice. He felt the blood piping through his body as he went from the water to the sand. He waded farther out into the river with each stone he cradled. </p>
<p>The boy yelled something to his friend upstream. Tim strained his ears but couldn’t hear what he said. He wondered if his eyes were squinted enough to look like they were focused on the rocks. </p>
<p>Two stone walls poked through the shallow water off the shore of the island. The shallow water enclosed within them was calm and beginning to warm. From where he sat, Tim had framed the boy between the piled rocks. They reached towards the boy like arms, stubborn against the force of the current.</p>
<p>As Tim started to dig his feet into the sand the boy’s head bolted up. Tim noticed his relaxed body straighten. Both hands clasped the fishing pole. The boy moved closer to the water and spread his sandaled feet wide. </p>
<p>Tim sat as still as his rocks, watching the taut line shake wildly in the water. The boy lifted the pole, leaning back and winding the creaking line into the reel. He yelled to his friend who threw down his pole and slunk over rocks and roots to his side.</p>
<p>Suddenly a flash of silver jumped near a pile of rocks and twisted branches off shore. The line was caught in a branch and the fish was halfway out of the water, thrashing madly against the current. Tim looked back to the boy, whose arms were taut. Tim noticed the boy’s hand had stopped turning the reel. He pushed the end of the pole down towards his feet and the tip rose into the air, curving like a hook. </p>
<p>Tim looked at the line. It seemed to stretch just before it snapped. The fishing pole bounced back, the curled line fluttering off the end. Anticipation drained from the boy’s face. Tim stood and looked back to the clump of debris. It was still there. The fish lay hanging in the branches. Its head jerked savagely. Tim’s body flashed with a hot jolt of electricity. He had to get the fish. </p>
<p>There was no question about it. He would wade out in the river and retrieve the fish. He would carry it to the boy on the shore.</p>
<p>Tim felt the air stop in his throat. The boy and his friend had turned from the river and were walking back up the embankment. The boy bent down to the tackle box. But his friend continued on to his spot up river. The boy began tying another hook to the line. Tim felt the air continue through his throat. The fish was thrashing.</p>
<p>Tim left the warmth of the sand, crept through the warmth of the walled water, and pushed forward. The water crept to his stomach.</p>
<p>He looked up. The boy was staring directly at him. Tim’s hot face didn’t mix with the rest of his frozen body. His thin arm lifted and told his hand to point to the fish. The boy nodded and showed his thumb to Tim with an encouraging smile. The boy’s yell was lost but Tim could understand what his lips said. Be careful. Tim’s heart was racing with the river.</p>
<p>He continued towards the fish. He was close.</p>
<p>Suddenly the sand beneath him wasn’t there. He dipped down and water bolted up to his shoulders. He thought he would be swept away but he set his tiny body rigid. His weak legs dug deep into the sand and stuck like fence posts. </p>
<p>Icy fists slammed onto his chest. His ribs closed in. Short breaths struggled to go deeper. He lifted his arms above his head. </p>
<p>Rumbling rapids reverberated through his ears. He thrust onward and felt a rock below. He grabbed a nearby branch. The metallic scales of the fish were a few feet away. He stepped on the rock. The fish’s head swayed left to right. The hook ate into its skeletal jaw. Tim heaved his body up. He stepped onto another rock halfway out of the water. He squatted against the current. Thick heaviness melted off his chest and his tiny throat flooded with sweet warm air.</p>
<p>Tim watched the fish suck in the heat, its gills only inches out of the water. A thin line of blood wove from its mouth through the folds of scales down its body. With shaking hand Tim stretched his arm towards the knotted line in the wood. He forced his fingers to uncurl and curl again around the line. The fish gave a final jolt. Tim pulled. The line fumbled in his hand. It slipped, and the fish was gone. </p>
<p>His heart plummeted to his stomach. For an instant he thought he could jump in and get the fish, but his body didn’t move. He searched the foaming water. His head forced his eyes up. They were watching him from the shore. The boy was directly in the sun. Tim noticed a single dark freckle sitting on the top of his left cheek. The tips of the boy’s lips curved up to his light eyes, pushing the freckle into the shadow of his eye socket.</p>
<p>“It’s okay! You tried,” the boy half screamed. “Can you make it back?” </p>
<p>Tim didn’t think he could. He didn’t want to. He sat on the rock in the river. He felt the cold bite at his skin despite the sun that blanketed him. The boy reached out over the water with his right hand to suggest an offering of help, but Tim didn’t move. The boy was just a few feet away. Tim watched a line of sweat run from the boy’s temple and settle on his jaw before falling to the river. His square hand lay open in the still air. </p>
<p>Tim loosened his grip on the branch and his feet were lifted from the rock. </p>
<p>Quickly the river took him. He spun in brute circles and sand crashed into him from below. He saw the boy lift his hand and wave. </p><br><br>

<p>The hard rapids faded away from him like a dying storm. The water spread and the shores on either side slugged away, putting Tim in the center of a green golden plain of pebbled glass. His head was a dark speck spinning slowly through the silent water. His toes bobbed on the surface. The cloudless sky expanded out above him. Up river the bridge, the island, and the boy were swallowed by the shadowed pines. </p>
<p>The needles guiding Tim’s body finally settled into him, and he let the river carry him on, following the dead fish. </p>
