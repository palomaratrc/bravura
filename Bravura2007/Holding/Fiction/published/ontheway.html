<center><b>On the Way to Possum Kingdom Lake</b><br>
By Robert Baucom</center><br><br>

<p>As a cynical and sarcastic eighteen year old, I went to work for Convair - Fort Worth, Texas - July 25, 1956.  Involved in the B-58 flight test program, the job title was  “Instrumentation Technician.” The first week, they sent me to the Jet Engine test stand to work with the newest thing out, the J-79 jet engines.  A year later, they issued me a secret clearance. Pretty heady stuff for a teenager. 	By far, the youngest person at the test stand. All others, ranged in ages from 27 to 64.  I was referred to as “Kid” or “The Kid” or “That suicidal motorcycle nut,  out splashing through the rain on his murder bike.”   Besieged, “The Kid” had quickly acquired a quick tongue defense to counter the flack from the 27 to 40 fellers.</p>
<p>Testing fully instrumented engines and control surfaces, we worked directly with the engineers. Charged with making the modifications to configure a scenario and getting it bought off by inspection, we ended up  running the engines through hours of tests. </p>
<p>After a couple of years of this, I realized that some of  these tests were a waste of time and money. Old Mr. Bordan, a farmer from Cleburne,  knew more about jet engines than some of the GE reps. Some tests were so outright ludicrous, it made  you wonder who would give some of these clowns a degree in engineering. </p>
<p>The last week of June, a couple of the older men asked one of these worthies, a Lubrications Engineer, "What's a grease we can put in our boat trailer wheel bearings, that won't wash out when we back it into the water?” </p>
<p>To me, this person was a prime example of the pseudo engineers,  that ended up  with degrees in the 1950Õs. Despite their lack of scientific aptitude, they were proficient in memorizing data and passing tests.  “Five years ago, I couldn't even spell en-gin-ear. Now I are one.”</p>
<p>Their fathers, putting down their Forbes Magazine, had said, "Look here son, these engineers are starting out with a higher salary than anyone except Doctors. I think you'd better major in engineering."  Better suited for a B.B.A., son didn't even understand the coaster brake on his bicycle.</p>
<p>This Lubrications Engineer lowered his voice to a deep tone and assuming a persona of importance, spoke in his best Sir Isaac Newton impression. "On the actuator struts on the B-58 landing gear, we use Silicone Grease. It is practically impervious to heat, cold or water.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, four old guys sneaked a sufficient amount of silicone grease out the gate, to pack their wheel bearings. That 4th of July weekend, they loaded up their boats and  headed for Possum Kingdom Lake. </p>
<p>That week, I’d  been away with a task on the flight line, so I didn’t learn of this silicone grease prescription until the following week.</p>
<p>All that he had told them was true -- to a point.  But,  the silicone grease of that date, most certainly was not a high speed, high heat, load carrying, roller bearing lubricant.</p>
<p>Texas in July? Probably 101¼ in the cool of the shade. Hauling ass at 60 plus, this unfortunate four’s rigs nearly burned off the ends of the axles.</p>
<p>Picture this:  Better than 70 miles out, faced with the dilemma of a broken down trailer - loaded with a big bass boat and a heavy ass motor. Sweating, no, cooking in the hot sun. No replacement bearings in the tool box and all the parts houses are closed.</p>
<p>Tuesday, the old folks were livid with rage. After “The Kid” had inquired as to their ire, they didn't appreciate my  hilarity and subsequent comments pertaining to the incident (especially since it was after the fact).</p>
<p>"Hell fellers, why didn't you ask me? On my motorcycle, I use mollidium disulfide grease. It’s a coloid. Molecularly, it has an extra sulfur atom in its outer ring, causing it to have a high affinity to metal and petroleum products. It practically plates the grease to the metal. Doesn't wash out. I read all about it in my British “Motorcycle Mechanics Magazine.”  The Limeys have been using it for years. You know that anti-seize compound we use on the engine mount and manifold bolts on the 4360's (B-36 Engines)? Get some on your hands and it's plenty hard to get off. Hell, it nearly has to wear off. That's because there's a large amount of mollidium disulfide in it.</p>
<p>“On the flight line, they use that silicone grease goop on the B-58 landing gear struts. Those are very low speed bearings at the strut pivots. The tubes slide on those bushings. It only comes into use when they lower or raise the landing gear. Works fine for that. Shore don't pack the wheel bearings with that silicone stuff."</p>
<p>Later, after they had the time to fully assimilate this scientific dissertation,  my stock was raised considerably with the “Gray Hairs.”  But at that time, this analysis from “The Kid,”  equated to pouring gasoline on the campfire. The “Boat People” were highly  pissed  with their “Lube Tech Feller.” Some acrimonious muttering referred to applying a light layer of tar to his epidermis  before rolling him in buzzard feathers. </p>
<p>The taunts became rather cruel, as he was asked, "What lubrication applications did you cover in college? Covered wagons and buckboards? How come “The Kid,” our resident motorcycle crazy, learned more about wheel grease out of a motorcycle magazine, than you did in college?"</p>
<p>In order to escape this choleric ridicule, he transferred to the main building. From then on, he was very cool toward me.  When ever we were in the same vicinity, he made a big production of not looking at me.</p>
<p>It bothered me none  -  I'd had my moment of respect with my elder colleagues.  </p>
