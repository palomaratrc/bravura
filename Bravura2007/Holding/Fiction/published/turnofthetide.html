<center><b>Turn of the Tide</b><br> 
<i>Editors’ Choice Winner, Fiction</i><br>
By Jack Mawhinney</center><br><br>

<p>Here I stand this evening at the shore’s edge, scared to death of the water. I look back on a terrifying incident of my childhood; the memory of a rip-tide that wouldn’t let me go until I passed out choking, clawing at my throat for breath. I still have nightmares of drowning in the surf while hundreds of gulls overhead shriek their approval. I tremble at the thought of it.</p>
<p>I back up from the water, put away the bad memories and watch the beach strollers. I wonder about them; their lives, families, and how they make a living. What they talk about as they pass me. It’s a game I play. Takes away from the loneliness.</p>
<p>There is an older man about my age who comes to the beach often. He wears eye glasses, and like me, has a game leg; the left as I recall. He comes alone every evening amongst a crowd of tourists who come to enjoy the vivid colors of the setting sun. But not the old man; he rarely looks away from the ground.  After an hour or so he leaves. His reason for coming to the shore remains a mystery.</p>
<p>I rarely hear him speak to anyone, and then only briefly. He is not unfriendly, but I don’t feel encouraged to introduce myself. I must admit though, I haven’t been talkative lately either. Poor health, due to old age has depressed me for some time. I wonder if his medicine cabinet is as crowded as mine.</p><br><br>

<p>It’s late. I should not have stayed on the beach after dark. Walking across the loose beach sand on a bad knee without light is painful. When I get home I’ll put my knee up in a comfortable position and spend the evening reminiscing about the past over an album of family pictures. It’s a good way to relax.</p>
<p>When my dad died, my older brother took off and hasn’t been heard from since. That left me responsible for looking after mother until she passed on. It was wonderful to have her company.</p>
<p>I have missed her ever since. Her last gift to me was the house, a seventy year old bungalow held together by clapboard siding and asphalt shingles. The house is a constant reminder of her.</p>
<p>Even though it’s after midnight, it’s impossible to sleep. The humidity is oppressive and the air is sticky. In the hope of dozing off I sprawl across the stripped down bed and speculate about the old man who haunts the beach every evening. I have a feeling that I know him.</p><br><br>

<p>The bright glare of the sun wakes me the next morning. It takes a moment to get my bearings. My mind snatches at disappearing fragments of dreams that leave me vaguely uneasy.  After a shower I throw on khaki shorts, a loose short-sleeved T-shirt and sandals. I make the coffee and cook three large eggs easy-over on a sizzling griddle of bacon strips and fried potatoes. The uneasiness is gone.</p>
<p>I lean back in my chair with a cup of steaming coffee and review my thoughts of last night, listing what I know of the old man. What I know is very little, except that he favors his left leg as I do. He is fairly old, and his hair is gray llike mine. His habits are those of a lonely man, uncommunicative and without companions. </p>
<p>This meager inventory certainly doesn’t satisfy my curiosity. But a second look at the oil painting recently purchased catches my attention. There is a gull in the upper left corner of the painting. It has an ominous look, the beak is open and the eyes hold a cold lack of compassion in its stare. It reminds me that on two occasions the old man frantically waved his arms to shoo the gull away from him. He was agitated and obviously afraid.</p><br><br>

<p>Saturday noon the news broadcast warned of an incoming storm of heavy rain accompanied by gale winds. That means huge breakers. Monster waves are a spectacular sight. Despite my fear of the sea, I want to see the waves. From a safe distance of course. Watching giant waves is like riding a roller coaster; both are gut thrilling, but safe. </p>
<p>In anticipation of nature’s show, I get to the beach in late afternoon to find it deserted under jet-black skies. The clouds hang low over huge breakers. The sea is driven by a hard offshore wind. Ozone is heavy in the air.</p>
<p>Away from the shoreline the open porch on the front of the beach bathrooms offer shelter. I barely get settled under its cover when a thundering clap of lightning strikes the buoy out beyond the breakers. A booming roar follows a second strike that splits the palm tree nearby. The porch roof shudders. Rain explodes from the sky like bullets, turning the ground into a marsh of puddles.</p>
<p>Out from behind the opaque curtain of rain the old man comes into view walking close to the breakers. His head is down, eyes fixed on the sand at his feet. When he comes within several yards of me, a huge gull sweeps down in front of the old man, wings beating the air. The bird darts from side to side, his cold eyes fixed on his target. Its piercing shrieks terrorize the old man leaving him shaking.</p>
<p>The gull wheels back in a menacing dive. This time the old man turns to the bird with a look of anguish. He raises his arms in plea. The gull flies in tight circles over the surf, shrieking with every pass. </p>
<p>The old man cowers. He turns away from the water. The gull screams, calling him back. Slowly facing the wall of water the old man takes a hesitant step into the waiting sea. He looks over his shoulder at the shore behind him with an expression of helplessness. The surf comes crashing down on him. He disappears under the surface. Lightning strikes the buoy with a clap of thunder. </p>
<p>I strain to see him, but he is lost in the vastness of the ocean. I stare at the water, breathing heavily. Gasping for air, my stomach has a queasy feeling that is hard to keep down. My chest is leaden, my ears ring and my head feels ready to burst. I can no longer see clearly, but the crazed laughs of hundreds of hooded gulls tell me more than eyesight can. The thunder is barely able to smother the sound of their penetrating shrieks.</p>
<p>The sky is filled with roiling ebony-black clouds. Chaos is smothering my consciousness. The taste of brackish salt water fills my mouth. There is no feeling in my body. The smell of ozone, the sound of thunder, and the pounding surf are all that remain of my world.</p><br><br>

<p>The quiet of absolute silence wakes me as I lay on my bed. Only the lingering smell of ozone remains from that terrifying dream. The horror is gone. I feel at ease, the day is soft velvet.</p>
<p>It comes to mind how odd it is that I have no sense of touch. There is no street noise either. Yet, I feel relaxed, almost serene. The strangest sensation occurs when I look up. It’s as though I am looking through the one way mirror of a calm sea.</p>
