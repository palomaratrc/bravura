<center><b>A Confession of My Own</b><br>
by Sarah O’Nan</center><br><br>

<p>I've begun to hate<br>
your deluded narcotic confessions.<br>
How you poured your innards out in front of me<br>
unsolicited but by my listening ear<br>
and prostrated yourself,<br>
raw and exposed to my youthful eyes,<br>
begging love and kindness from my undeveloped heart. <br>
Now your blood has splashed onto my clothes<br>
and I must fight the urge to turn away and retch<br>
at the sight of your simple humanity.<br>
I cannot still the downward strike<br>
of the knife you wield against yourself<br>
through my forgiveness,<br>
nor my condemnation.<br>
I will not be your Jesus<br>
and I refuse to sacrifice myself on your behalf. <br>
I much preferred the cool and smooth plastic mask <br>
of light discourse and breezy fun.<br>
The bright and smiling expression of which <br>
distracted from your dark and frightened eyes.<br>
I felt free, then, to go about my business<br>
and leave you to yours. <br>
With these secrets you've revealed<br>
you grab me from behind and tightly clasp me to your chest<br>
ignoring my blank stare<br>
and unable to know my selfish dreams of freedom.<br>
Squeeze out all the peace and comfort you can<br>
from my stiff and ungiving self<br>
before I rip through your cellophane dream<br>
and politely tell you to <br>
please shut the gate as you leave-<br>
and don't forget the pieces of yourself<br>
you scattered at my feet. </p>
