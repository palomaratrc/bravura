<center><b>maybe she’s born with it</b><br>
By Nicole Lee</center><br><br>

<p>fish<br>
cute little fish<br>
in glass<br>
breathing liquid,<br>
extracting gas,<br>
cute little girl<br>
in the usual dress<br>
seeping joy<br>
in a messy sorta<br>
frenetic sorta<br>
desperate sorta<br>
way </p>

<p>she was never<br>
meant to fit a <br>
pinafore just cause<br>
that's what's always<br>
come before.<br>
leaking joy, <br>
seeping through,<br>
like every girl<br>
untrained will do</p>

<p>breaking past<br>
the cover-up, she finds<br>
blushes never come<br>
in compacts to be <br>
applied with brushes—<br>
they are the result of<br>
early morning adrenaline<br>
rushes</p>

<p>sweet fish<br>
cute in a bowl<br>
lovely woman<br>
messy and whole<br>
smelly, stained<br>
and wonderfully<br>
drained of emptiness</p>

<p>her delicacy cracks<br>
in the living</p>
