<center><b>San Ignacio Lagoon, March 2003</b><br>
By Jenne A. Mendenhall</center><br><br>

<p>A green flash drops the sliver sun into the lagoon<br>
Night, black and starless settles over the beach<br>
Where we sip cocktails, ears open for whale talk, whale<br>
Play squeaks, whistles, grunts, moans croaks<br>
Water slapping love songs carried in by tidal wash.<br>
Salt mists born of leviathan leaps spray us<br>
Blind watchers of orgasmic rites<br>
Rapt listeners to Ignacian water music</p>

<p>By day we lubbers dinghy out in deep green water<br>
To see and touch twelve ton babies and their dams<br>
Who glide under and around us in close formation.<br>
They dive, emerge, approach to take our measure<br>
Then standing on his tail a big eyed baby rides up<br>
To stare us down, arms length away.<br>
(For him no inkling memory of murderous men<br>
Stripping his kind of ambergris and oil.)<br>
We are beside ourselves, falling over one another rocking<br>
Our boat to stretch, to touch the cool rubbery skin to stare<br>
Back into the great unblinking eve.</p>
