<center><b>SORTIE</b><br>
By Bill Bailey</center><br><br>

<p>He is top of his class, America's finest, <br>
He sits in silence traveling toward<br>
Hell with the speed of thunder. <br>
Adrenalin flows, heart pounds, <br>
The moment is now.<br>
The sky is lit, reminiscent of some <br>
dimly remembered patriotic display. <br>
Deadly flashes blossom.<br>
White and red and yellow, streak the darkness.<br>
He flies on, into a kaleidoscope of peril<br>
His panel and Heads-Up pour data into his brain.<br>
He is one with his machine. A great calm envelops him. <br>
This is what he was trained for. Find the target!<br>
Aim the laser! Fire<br>
Down the air shaft of military headquarters. <br>
Orange fire bursts from a hundred windows. <br>
A perfect shot and no collateral damage.<br>
The clutching claws of anxiety return. <br>
Avionic senses feel missiles reaching to destroy him.<br>
By the book, he starts evasive maneuvers. <br>
A comrade blinds his adversary with electronic sorcery.<br>
He's out. Free.<br>
He's heading home.<br>
He takes three deep breaths and tries to ignore the tremor in his left hand.<br>
A dozen confused SAMs, unable to find their target, <br>
reach their apogee and fall helplessly toward Earth. <br>
Plunging toward homes and schools and shops.<br>
He stands on solid ground. <br>
A cool wave of relief, breaks and washes over him. <br>
Buddies return one by one. <br>
His best friend is not among them. <br>
That night he weeps quietly for a few minutes, <br>
then falls into a troubled sleep.<br>
Tomorrow he will fly again.</p>
