<center><b>South of Los Angeles, west of the desert</b><br>
Linda Roux</center><br><br>

<center>I</center><br><br>

<p>Oranges smacking of amor y el mar,
whose blossoms perfumed Scheherazade&#8217;s palms
as she spread petals round her treacherous bed,
that make mouths fructose-glad and dagger-tart,</p>

<p>require adversity to make them sweet:
a brief coolness, but not the punishing cold
that blackens green shoots and drags men from warm beds
to trundle smudge pots down rows of stoic trees;</p>

<p>no, the right dose of pain can be justified
when the sugar speaks up and the acid retorts;
when the first bite of one elicits surprise
like a flock of sun conures crossing the sky. </p>
 
<center>II</center><br><br>

<p>Driving, I&#8217;ve seen down a narrow side street
the bluest ocean, a pagoda of clouds on top;
and at night, attracted by the turquoise light
of plankton proliferating in the liquid dark,
I&#8217;ve seen their light smashed into pale blue atoms
each time a wave broke itself on the sand;
but now on this warm wood bench in the sun
high above the sea it looks like someone
has unrolled a bolt of peacock-blue silk
shot through with some metallic thread 
and left it snapping in the wind
from end to hemisphere-far end;
today, in spite of family lost&#8212;
one way or another, too many have left&#8212;
the water is too wide and bright not to feel
that even strafed it&#8217;s wonderful to be alive.</p>
