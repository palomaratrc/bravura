<center><b>Ten aerialists</b><br>
Linda Roux</center><br><br>

<p>We make our ways singly across the high wire, <br>
each of the family venturing a step<br>
into the broad blue delirium <br>
above the striped tents and reeling rides.</p>

<p>This one advances in heartfelt increments,<br>
practically level with the lunchtime sun,<br>
then attempts a pirouette in a drastic wind;<br>
there’s no hearing us once she’s begun that career.</p>

<p>Another’s dressed up in chartreuse, and shouts<br>
her doubts while retreating down the ladder to earth,<br>
and succeeds in pinning her frilly self there; <br>
hopefully she hasn’t unnerved the rest.</p>

<p>Near her on the ground the simple one seeks<br>
his slippers; and having never been able<br>
to learn even rudimentary routines<br>
perhaps he’s the most contented of all.</p>

<p>On the wire the strong-chested aerialist<br>
navigates nearly to the far pedestal,<br>
a gondolier plying the high, pelagic spaces<br>
with an ill-balanced pole; he founders up there.</p>

<p>Two steps across and our silver-sequined sister<br>
throws down her pole, then her body headfirst,<br>
each spangle repeating the noon-high sun<br>
as she falls fast and faster and farther beneath it.</p>

<p>For the rest of our troupe, it’s too soon to discern<br>
the familiar flaw, or to know if we’ll have to<br>
witness another botched acrobat.<br>
Maybe the best way to reach the far end</p>

<p>is to stand on the platform when your turn comes,<br>
let a breeze lift a few strands of your hair<br>
and have a black laugh at our odds while leaning<br>
lightly into that big blue vault.</p>
