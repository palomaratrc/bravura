<center><b>Tour Diary</b><br>
By George Pearson</center><br><br>

<p>I wish I could have come<br>
to the place<br>
where you were<br>
standing in the photograph<br>
with all the pedestrians<br>
they were wandering around<br>
I was wondering just<br>
where you were at<br>
cause there were no signs<br>
planted in the ground<br>
no subtle clues<br>
as to where<br>
your feet were touching down<br>
and I think<br>
I just wanted to be there too<br>
I just wanted to touch your face<br>
if I left now<br>
could I get there soon?<br>
cause I just want to be with you.</p>
