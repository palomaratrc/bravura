<center><b>we women say 'watch your weight'</b><br>
By Nicole Lee</center><br><br>

<p>typically freezing happens <br>
when the temperature drops <br>
but I am frozen now, <br>
though the mercury’s <br>
higher than any kite beneath <br>
blizzard clouds; my herstory <br>
compels me to save my energy <br>
when the world tries to warm me, <br>
‘cause you can never trust what’s <br>
willing to cook you when it cooks<br>
you for its own consumption </p>

<p>so I freeze instead of thaw.</p>

<p>I’m not meat you can tenderize<br>
with whispered softened words, <br>
cause silk makes rope as surely as <br>
cotton and that I do realize </p>

<p>You set me in your sink and <br>
turn on the faucet, thinking <br>
water is a great conductor of<br>
energy and will quickly relieve<br>
me of my ice, warm my frosted <br>
muscles.  Are you surprised I <br>
sit with a perfect crystallized<br>
gaze and freeze the water that<br>
falls on me, my own way to<br>
conduct energy?</p>

<p>I am ripe when I am raw.<br>
without homegrown blends <br>
of rosemary and thyme, <br>
I have flavor, sweet ache, <br>
unhesitating anger, and<br>
something else to savor—<br>
bitterness, hope, and the<br>
source of what I gave her</p>

<p>Holding back cause I’ll never<br>
be your main dish I preserve<br>
myself like berries in jam<br>
‘cept without the boiling and<br>
excess sweetness </p>

<p>I calculate on frostbite<br>
cause I’m tired of being <br>
wrapped tight til you're ready<br>
to cook and, for the record, I<br>
do not mix well with butter <br>
substitutes--I taste best with the <br>
real thing and do not thin me with <br>
water;  I am not 'light' with twenty<br>
percent less fat:  fuck that. I'm heavy,<br>
hardy, a real meal and you can<br>
not digest me.  I'll never be<br>
I’ll never be<br>
I’ll never again be<br>
your main course</p>
