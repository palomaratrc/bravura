<center><b>“Ghosts and Glass”</b><br>
John Savage</center><br><br>

<p>glass shatters—</p>

<p>when handled with shaking hands.<br>
hands that have had too much to drink.<br>
or not enough.</p>

<p>in kitchens everywhere—</p>

<p>shelves are lined with the ghosts of forgotten teacups,<br>
plates, wineglasses.<br>
things dropped and swept away<br>
like ancient cities<br>
or bread crumbs.</p>

<p>i remember them now—</p>

<p>as i’m sitting at my desk<br>
eating oreo cookies,<br>
wiping up spilt orange juice with toilet paper.</p>

<p>but i’m not really thinking about broken glass—</p>

<p>it’s more about how things are so easily forgotten.<br>
how ghosts are so easily made,<br>
so easily ignored.</p>

<p>but not even that, really—</p>

<p>it’s more about how we make ghosts of things we drop.<br>
of how we don’t try to fix something<br>
when it’s so easily swept away.</p>
