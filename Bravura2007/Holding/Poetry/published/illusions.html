<center><b>Illusions</b><br>
<i>Editors’ Choice Winner, Poetry</i><br>
By Sarah O’Nan</center><br><br>

<p>You almost had me going. <br>
I found myself believing <br>
that those rabbits <br>
pulled out of your hat <br>
were real. <br>
But I guess I was tricked, <br>
because they disappeared <br>
when you left.<br>
And the bird you turned into a <br>
funny mouse that danced when I <br>
clapped my hands? <br>
It flew out my window yesterday <br>
squeaking something about smoked gouda. <br>
So now it's all back to illusions, <br>
mind games and sleight of hand, <br>
and it's up to me to continue the facade. <br>
I pull the cape out and over your eyes <br>
while I wave my wand and try to fool you <br>
and the audience <br>
into believing my apathy. <br>
But tell me again of the magic words... <br>
I knew them once <br>
when you whispered into my ear <br>
as you sawed me in half. </p>
