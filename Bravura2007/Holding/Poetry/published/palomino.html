<center><b>Palomino</b><br>
By Kelly Callahan</center><br><br>

<p>She bit her lip as she worked.<br>
Her fingers intertwined in gleaming strands of sunshine,<br>
separating and straightening as strays<br>
danced in Summer’s afternoon whispers.</p>

<p>Kneeling, she reached the end of her descent.<br>
The last wisps fell from her fingertips,<br>
rejoining the glittering others<br>
for a fleeting moment of flawless beauty.</p>

<p>But the world cannot condone such perfection.<br>
With a stomp and a swish,<br>
the flaxen and gold burst into myriad pieces<br>
and were cast into the wind<br>
to settle once more in tranquil chaos.</p>
