<center><b>Quest for a Parking Pass, or, A Quick Note to the C.P.</b><br>
By Tanna Klein</center><br><br>

<p>Went I, with currency green,<br>
to pay the yellow box obscene.<br>
T'was there I then discovered<br>
one whose wide mouth was covered<br>
and one other with open jaw<br>
that swallowed naught put in its maw.<br>
Still, they both had mouths petit<br>
which, perhaps, would coinage eat...<br>
Traipsed I back to building yon<br>
to alchemize paper to metal therein.<br>
My task complete, I journeyed again<br>
to the faraway place where to boxes do den,<br>
there to find the first resolutely aslumber<br>
and the second with no appetite for coins of any number.<br>
Fed up quite fully at last<br>
did I trudge to this stead and bid you that,<br>
should you care for my dollars, two,<br>
you pay me a visit in yon classroom.<p>
