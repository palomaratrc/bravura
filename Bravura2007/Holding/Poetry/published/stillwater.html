<center><b>Still Water</b><br>
By Brent Ohlendorf</center><br><br>

<p>It took me a while to see what had died,<br>
yet even now I still treat it as living.<br>
You do the same I assume, making sure to comfort it’s corpse.<br>
We both speak of the deceased as living, as breathing.<br>
And as breath becomes whispers, whispers become words,<br>
the lingering candor of a broken being <br>
becomes little more than a bewildered memory.<br>
It’s life, a lie no doubt, your lie reflecting mine, mine reflecting yours,<br>
like a mirror over still water,<br>
the perceived infinity only an illusion in the reflection,<br>
only a dream mistakenly seen as life.</p>

<p>I used to blame fate for devotion’s departure, always pitting us against one another.<br>
Then I blamed myself, easily a scapegoat.<br>
Then came God, society, time and space.<br>
I blamed anything and everything.<br>
Then I stopped blaming all together.<br>
I realized that if fate planned passion’s demise, it did its job.<br>
If God and society really wanted a casualty, then there’s no arguing the Will.<br>
Time and space were always in the realms of science, <br>
and I hope affection isn’t easily explained away as a chemical imbalance.<br>
That last anything and everything, well…that used to be you,<br>
and I’m done blaming you.</p>

<p>Yet without anyone to blame, I’m left with nothing.<br>
No tears for the departed, even though I wish there were.<br>
I’ve seen the desert rose in a summer’s rain,<br>
so much beauty destroyed by thirst,<br>
life not seen as precious until it no longer exists.<br>
Yet my indifference is worn as an emperor’s clothing,<br>
the nothingness oozing out as an almost endless apathy towards you.<br>
I know now tears of apathy don’t exist. <br>
Tears of a lost life are useless.</p>

<p>‘In Memoriam’ provides little solace<br>
as I assure you Tennyson was wrong in his assumption.<br>
And believe that Severin taught me nothing,<br>
for you needed no whip or furs my Venus, <br>
only a life to forget and a death not to be mourned,<br>
a dreamless sleep not to remember.<br>
Yet now I see dreams don’t end, you merely wake up,<br>
and it’s the reality that I will never again wake up next to you,<br>
that keeps me asleep,<br>
that keeps my lie below yours,<br>
In the still water I should have known never to drink.</p>
