<center><b>Straw Colored Tiger</b><br>
<i>Angelo Carli Poetry Prize Recipient (First Place Winner, Poetry)</i><br>
By Clayton Beach</center><br><br>

<p>I stepped out of  the secondhand book store <br>
alone<br>
only to be embraced <br>
by a chill fog that drifted<br>
in scarves of green, yellow and red,<br>
that danced and lifted<br>
like magic <br>
in the electrically amber night. </p>

<p>A mated pair of indie kids walked ahead.<br>
He had the skinniest ass <br>
I’ve ever seen, <br>
a 12 year old girl’s ass, <br>
snug inside <br>
its studded denim dungeon.  <br>
They slipped out of the fog<br>
and into a Starbucks<br>
leaving me <br>
to walk the streets forlorn.</p>

<p>As I approached the intersection<br>
of Robinson and 6th,<br>
cars scuttled through the fog<br>
like angry steel beetles.<br>
A Mercedes shouted in alarm<br>
and screeched its brakes,<br>
raising its stinkbug butt<br>
but releasing no noxious spray <br>
into the face of an oversized Ford<br>
that towered above the traffic <br>
on black balloon tires.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the corner <br>
I was spellbound to the concrete,<br>
frozen in place by the Red Right Hand,<br>
leaving me to ponder the prismatic scarves <br>
of fog that ever shifted<br>
from green, to yellow, to red <br>
and back again<br>
while a wild moon <br>
loomed<br>
obscurely high<br>
in the starless,<br>
cottony void.<br>
As I waited for the light, <br>
she suddenly materialized,<br>
an apparition distilled from fog.<br>
She paced the corner,<br>
impatient as a housebound tabby <br>
longing for sparrows <br>
that flutter about<br>
just outside her window.</p>

<p>Her movements were anxious<br>
and her clothes were plain<br>
and threadbare,<br>
treading that thin line<br>
between hippy and derelict.<br>
Her hair was mostly smooth<br>
and silky, straw colored,<br>
and yet, it was nappy in places and <br>
carelessly tied in a half assed bun<br>
that loosed stray strands<br>
along the long,<br>
graceful nape of her neck.</p>

<p>She paced,<br>
this straw colored tiger,<br>
caged in the mist that glowed<br>
with sanguine light<br>
stained by the Red Right Hand.</p>

<p>Red Circle yielded to Green Arrow<br>
and the noisy little beetles <br>
marched on in their silly procession,<br>
winding their way in front of us.<br>
At this first hint of green, <br>
the tiger pounced upon the asphalt<br>
only to be cut off with an angry beep<br>
voiced by a prissy, purple Saturn.<br>
She stood in the middle of the road,<br>
impeded by the flow of steel<br>
and then turned swiftly <br>
to look at me. <br>
She was beautiful there <br>
ensconced in the amber fog,<br>
her blues piercing, <br>
though childlike and pleading,<br>
begging me to join her <br>
in defiance of the traffic gods.</p>

<p>She was trapped<br>
there, in the middle of the street, <br>
unsure of whether to forge ahead <br>
or make a hasty retreat,<br>
faltering, tense and jittery<br>
in the no man’s land<br>
between two sidewalks,<br>
until the Red Right Hand <br>
yielded to the Little Green Man,<br>
and we crossed the street<br>
together<br>
in a moment of Martian harmony.</p>

<p>She walked ahead of me,<br>
my straw colored tiger,<br>
slipping through the fog<br>
with an air of sensuous femininity.<br>
Her gait had smoothed,<br>
her hips began to sway<br>
and her body flowed,<br>
lithe and delicate,<br>
as I looked at her<br>
with newfound love, <br>
charmed by one girlish look <br>
that she gave to me in the street<br>
until at last,<br>
she whipped around a corner and <br>
disappeared <br>
into the fog<br>
leaving nothing but <br>
a swirling red scarf of mist.  </p>
