<center><b>Why Do I Bother With Caffeine?</b><br>
By Donna Booher</center><br><br>

<p>While finding myself,<br>
thinking of you,<br>
I will order a latte.  <br>
Expensive and <br>
heavy on the cream.<br>
Or, maybe, just two tablespoons worth. <br>
But hold the sugar.  <br>
Well, maybe, one lump.</p>

<p>I will sip it slowly, <br>
On a cold morning, of a hot day.<br>
After celebrating two birthdays in line,<br>
Wondering why I asked for a shot <br>
of espresso, <br>
instead of hot chocolate. <br>
When I know I hate <br>
espresso. </p>

<p>But I’ve already paid my dues. For the latte.<br>
And sadly, there are no refunds.  On lattes.  <br>
So against my better judgment, <br>
I’ll chug it down; <br>
As if it was a shot of tequila. <br>
Even though it’s clearly too early, <br>
For tequila. <br>
Damn espresso. </p>

<p>But all in all this is a perfect way, <br>
To spend a morning, <br>
When thinking<br>
of you.  <br>
Getting up early; waiting in line, <br>
Till noon.  <br>
Just to over pay <br>
for a cup of ruined coffee.</p>
