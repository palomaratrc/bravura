        <h1>The Howling Rooster</h1>
          <p>Julianne North</p>
        <p>Oh, the stories Arthur told about his  upbringing in a small town on the Mississippi Delta, dark Faulknerian tales  that outraged and saddened Julie.&nbsp; His  mother, Adelaide,  emerged as the centerpiece in these tales. <br />
          As a child Arthur slept in his  parent&rsquo;s bedroom.&nbsp; Twin beds dominated  the room, but Julie never determined exactly where Arthur slept. One year after  his father&rsquo;s death of lung cancer, the eleven-year-old insisted on moving  upstairs to his own room.&nbsp; His mother  opposed the move.&nbsp; She preferred to keep  him close to her to ease the loneliness of widowhood.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,  Arthur,&rdquo; she whined, &ldquo;stay downstairs with me so you can keep me company.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re going to be scared up there all by  yourself.&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her  entreaties fell on deaf ears.&nbsp; As Harold  transferred his possessions from his mother&rsquo;s bedroom to the large guest room  upstairs, he marched up the curved marble stairway to freedom.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mom, I&rsquo;m old enough for my own room.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t worry about me. I&rsquo;m not afraid of the  dark.&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One childhood episode haunted  him.&nbsp; When Harold, Arthur&rsquo;s father, was  diagnosed with lung cancer in the late 1940&rsquo;s, there was no chemotherapy or  radiation to help.&nbsp; Arthur, sleeping in  the bedroom, was often at his father&rsquo;s side.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;One morning when the two of them were alone,  the father teased his son, &ldquo;You should be outside playing ball with those boys  next door.&nbsp; Someone might think you&rsquo;re a  momma&rsquo;s boy.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur winced.&nbsp; Angered, he punched his father in the chest. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no  momma&rsquo;s boy!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harold slumped forward in  pain. His cancer had advanced into his ribs, and a single punch was enough  break a wasted rib. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adelaide had overheard  Arthur&rsquo;s shouting and rushed into the room.&nbsp;  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on in here?&rdquo; she demanded.&nbsp;  Surveying the room, she spotted Harold holding his rib cage.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong Harold?&nbsp; Are you hurt?&rdquo; Wringing her hands, she turned  a suspicious gaze on Arthur. &ldquo;What did you do to your father?&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t  mean to hurt him, Mother,&rdquo; sobbed the child.&nbsp;  &ldquo;We were just playing.&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;How could you  have hit your father and hurt him?&nbsp; You  know he is sick.&nbsp; Bad, bad boy!&nbsp; Shame on you!&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur burst into tears.&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt Dad.&nbsp; Honest.&rdquo;&nbsp;  His guilt, deepened by the shame his mother heaped on him, stayed with  him.&nbsp; Julie believed that even in  adulthood he felt responsible for hastening his father&rsquo;s death.&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur still missed his father, remembering  him as a loving and kind man. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur  recounted an earlier incident that took place when he was five or six years  old.&nbsp; Playing in the yard under the  supervision of one of the maids, he spotted his mother dressed in white leaving  the house to go to a garden party.&nbsp; He  ran to her and grabbed her white dress with his muddy hands, pleading with her  not to leave.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Momma,  don&rsquo;t go.&nbsp; Stay and be with me.&nbsp; Please.&rdquo;&nbsp;  His mother was furious with the handprints and pushed the child  away.&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Look what  you did to my dress, you naughty boy!&nbsp;  Now I have to change, and I&rsquo;ll be late for the party.&rdquo;&nbsp; She turned to the nanny and ordered her to  &ldquo;take him inside and lock him in the hall closet.&rdquo;&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He  remembered staying in the dark closet a long time.&nbsp; He cried for what felt like hours, but no one  came.&nbsp; Although Arthur attempted to mask  his pain with humor, Julie began to understand the impact of these experiences on  his developing personality.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He recalled  his mother as remote and inconsistently strict.&nbsp;  Sex was a taboo subject in the home. Adelaide  never breathed a word to Arthur about the changes that would occur in his body  at puberty.&nbsp; When he was in his early  teens, a cousin in her forties came to visit.&nbsp;  During a time when his mother was away from the house on an errand, his  cousin lured him into the bathroom, enticed him into the shower and persuaded  him to wash her pubic hair.&nbsp; Arthur never  mentioned this incident to his mother.&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several  years later a male cousin visited from Oregon.&nbsp; He and Arthur ended up sharing a double bed  upstairs because there was no guestroom.&nbsp;  Given the opportunity and the close proximity, the much older cousin  made sexual advances to the impressionable 15-year-old.&nbsp;&nbsp; When Arthur told Julie about the cousin, he  did not provide much detail.&nbsp; She  gathered he had rebuffed the cousin and left the bedroom.&nbsp; Again, Arthur kept quiet about the fondling.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first  time Julie met Adelaide,  the older woman regaled her with stories about her irreproachable family.&nbsp; It was as if she had pushed a button in Adelaide&rsquo;s doughy stomach  and out gushed the monologue.&nbsp; &ldquo;Everyone  in my family graduated from college.&nbsp;  They have all been successful in life.&nbsp;  I am so proud of all of them.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extolling  the virtues of her kinfolk in one breath, she ranted against communism and  homosexuality in the next.&nbsp; Her prejudice  embraced most ethnic minority groups, the ACLU and California liberals, to name a few. One  evening, as Adelaide  railed against the evils of homosexuality, Julie thought about the cousins who  accosted Arthur years ago. She figured there were at least two pedophiles in  the family and possibly one homosexual. &nbsp;At wit&rsquo;s end, Julie turned to her and said,  &ldquo;Homosexuality is not a disease. It&rsquo;s much more common than you think.&nbsp; You might even have one in your own  family.&rdquo;&nbsp; Julie&rsquo;s outburst silenced her,  a rare event indeed.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It must have  caused Adelaide  great distress to see her only child married to a liberal.&nbsp; Julie hoped so.&nbsp; In Adelaide&rsquo;s  mind, Julie was suspect on two counts.&nbsp;  She was a native Californian, for Adelaide  a region that embodied self-indulgence and wickedness.&nbsp; To make matters worse Julie had attended an  eastern, Yankee, liberal arts college.&nbsp;  The two women were at opposite poles in temperament and belief  systems.&nbsp; They clashed often.<br />
          The educational and vocational  choices that Adelaide made following her  graduation from the University   of Arkansas with a degree  in home economics opened a window into her personality.&nbsp; On weekends she traveled to Arkansas State  Fairs in a model T Ford, selected and purchased with her own money. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
          At the State Fairs she performed an  unusual procedure.&nbsp; She castrated  roosters, a technique also known as caponizing cockerels.&nbsp; The process involved starving a rooster for  at least 24 hours to avoid complications during the surgical removal of the  internal testicles. Adelaide  insisted that &quot;the birds who did not survive died a quick and painless  death by bleeding and that they were not a total loss since they were still  good to eat.&quot;&nbsp; This home economics  major was not a quilter, baker or jam maker. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dismayed by  Arthur&rsquo;s account of his upbringing, the full significance of how his mother&rsquo;s  behavior shaped his temperament and intellect did not become clear to Julie until  much later in their relationship.&nbsp; Arthur  was the product of family dynamics that followed the distinctly Southern  literary tradition of William Faulkner and Tennessee Williams.&nbsp; </p>
