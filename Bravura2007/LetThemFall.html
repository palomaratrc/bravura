        <h1>Let Them Fall</h1>
          <p>Matt Schnarr</p>
        <p>I've been walking in the  rain for an hour now.&nbsp; My black coat has  been soaked, and it feels like tar clinging to my back.&nbsp; I don't care about puddles, I'm soaked to the  point where water makes it dryer.&nbsp; My  tears have blended in with the rain, combining into bitter sweet dew  drops.&nbsp; My hair has been matted down, and  probably resembles a roadkill-wig.&nbsp; At  this point I really don't give a shit.&nbsp; I  just want to get home.</p>
        <p><em>She's been looking out  her window, her eyes are searching for him.&nbsp;  Her heart pattern has gone up and down enough to make a Motzart symphony  jealous.&nbsp; The night time sky makes her  reflection more noticeable.&nbsp; It's eyes  are darker, more open, like voids they reach into her eyes.&nbsp; They suck out her mind, and work lower, and  lower until her heart comes out from her mouth; and she releases her tale upon  a thin glass window.</em></p>
        <p><strong>It flutters.&nbsp; Vibrations.&nbsp;  Its senior is asleep, so someone else must be talking.&nbsp; Its senior's words can be felt from inside,  but anyone else outside are only vibrations; seeing as it has no ears the only  thing it has is touch.&nbsp; It has super  touch, like a super hero.&nbsp; A freaking  super hero, it is so full of itself, not so much now, but lately it has  been.&nbsp; Right now it's relaxed, and mildly  annoyed for coming out of hibernation.&nbsp;  If only it had the ears to hear.</strong></p>
        <p>My car died awhile  back.&nbsp; No gas, and me being the  pretentious fuck-up that I am, I figured I'd walk the rest of the way.&nbsp; I am so loathing myself right now, and if my  feet had mouths they'd probably tell me that I should.&nbsp; I'm not really thinking about where I am, or  was going for that matter.&nbsp; All I can  think about is the strange man in the dark suit across from me under the street  light.&nbsp; His face is cut in half by a  smiling shadow; made from the top hat's bill over his fore-head.&nbsp; The shadows are the only joyful things  tonight, I can tell you that much.<br />
  &quot;Hello!&quot; He  yells to me.&nbsp; To me, what a fucking  bastard.<br />
          Oh god, this is the part  where I respond to a rhetorical statement.&nbsp;  &quot;Hi.&quot;&nbsp; Oh nice move,  smooth.<br />
  &quot;Nice  evening.&quot;&nbsp; What the hell is he  talking about, does he even notice that his...well, that&rsquo;s surprising, somehow  his jacket has remained dry.&nbsp; Maybe I  should step under that li-&quot;if you like rain.&quot;&nbsp; Had to say something right?<br />
  &quot;Don't do it  Jack.&quot;</p>
        <p><em>&quot;Oh what do you  know?&quot;&nbsp; She says.</em><br />
            <em>&quot;I know what  you've done,&quot; it replies, smiling with the black holes in its sockets,  &quot;I know what you're thinking about right now.&quot;</em><br />
            <em>&quot;Well explain it  to me, cause I was spaced out until you interrupted.&quot;</em><br />
            <em>&quot;What will he do  when he gets back?&quot;</em><br />
            <em>&quot;Oh shove  off!&quot; She steps back, feeling self malice in every fiber of the carpet  beneath her feet.</em></p>
        <p><strong>An even more sudden  vibration!&nbsp; For the love of god, could it  just go into its private place, for a few minutes?&nbsp; A few god damn minutes!&nbsp; Any more noise and it won't be the only thing  awake and erect.&nbsp; Its senior, he is very  grouchy with sudden awakenings, he likes his beauty sleep.&nbsp; But lately, from its perspective, it wouldn't  seem that he needs it.</strong></p>
        <p>&quot;Pardon?&quot;&nbsp; What the hell is the guy talking about?&nbsp; Anyone that wears a tailed jacket this time  of night should definitely be questioned, especially in intentions.<br />
  &quot;Jack, don't do  it.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Don't do what?&quot;<br />
  &quot;You know what I am  referring to.&quot;<br />
  &quot;No, I really  don't.&quot;&nbsp; This fucking guy.&nbsp; How the hell can he be so fucking coy, so  damn shit-laced dry?!<br />
  &quot;It isn't worth  it.&quot;</p>
        <p><em>&quot;Confront it  Jill.&quot;&nbsp; It says with dark honesty.</em><br />
            <em>&quot;Confront what, I  don't know what you're talking about.&quot;</em><br />
            <em>&quot;It's four feet  from you, and you don't know what I'm talking about?&quot;</em><br />
            <em>&quot;That...That isn't  important.&quot;</em><br />
            <em>&quot;No, that robe you  slid into isn't important,&quot; it says, a smirk on its face, &quot;this is  now, and its necessary.&quot;</em></p>
        <p><strong>The vibrations have  settled, and it swoons down into its silence again.&nbsp; Any more stress, and its going to be hard in  the morning.</strong></p>
        <p>&quot;If you are referring  to gas prices, get with the fucking times.&quot; I swear this guy's going to  end up in a drag bar from &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot;.<br />
  &quot;No Jack, I'm  referring to your intentions.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Funny, I was just  about to ask you about yours.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Just preventing a  mistake, I assure you.&quot;&nbsp; Look at  that sincere smile, this guy should be on the cover of fucking Times.<br />
  &quot;Mistakes are  inevitable, so what the hell are you getting at?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Sexual diseases are  inevitable, so what are you screwing for?&quot;&nbsp;  I knew it!<br />
  &quot;Is that what this  is?&nbsp; Are you trying to get a jig in my  pants?&quot;<br />
  &quot;No, I'm preventing a  disease.&quot;</p>
        <p><em>She held tears back,  flooding behind her eye lids.&nbsp; &quot;I  can't confront it...&quot;</em><br />
            <em>&quot;You can, and I  can help you.&quot;</em><br />
            <em>&quot;I don't want your  help.&quot;</em><br />
            <em>&quot;You usually need  what you don't want.&quot;</em><br />
            <em>&quot;I want you to  leave.&quot;</em><br />
            <em>&quot;We always want  what we don't need.&quot;</em><br />
            <em>&quot;LEAVE ME  ALONE!&quot;&nbsp; Jill frantically began to  bang the window frame, slashing at it, punching it, pushing acceptance back  with a hurricane.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Again with the  vibrations.&nbsp; It can tell they're distant,  going off like bombs over a mountain shaking sheets of snow; but these just  shake the sheets around it.&nbsp; Long  vibrations, yells of anguish.&nbsp; It knows  the feeling of a yell from pleasure, and this is more like feeling rusted  aluminum than silk or satin.&nbsp; Its senior  begins to awake.</strong></p>
        <p>&quot;If it's so  inevitable, then why not just let it happen now?&quot;&nbsp; I took a debate class in High School, I  failed, but I took it.<br />
  &quot;Some things are  worth preserving.&quot;<br />
  &quot;But can we choose  what should be preserved?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Are you a pessimist,  or an optimist?&quot;<br />
          I always thought those  sounded like terms of communism, &quot;lets say I'm a pessimist.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Then we should let  the dice fall as they may.&quot;<br />
  &quot;And if I'm an  optimist?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Then we throw the  dice faster, and farther.&nbsp; So it has more  time to land on the sides we want.&quot;<br />
  &quot;What if I just don't  give a damn?&quot;&nbsp; I try to keep an  apathetic facade, I'm full of fu-I'm full of shit.<br />
  &quot;Then you hold on to  the dice, and pretend they don't hold some sort of value.&quot;</p>
        <p><em>Small tears begin to  melt her mascara into an abstract art piece.&nbsp;  It wouldn't be going too far to say that that reflects how she feels;  drowning in her midnight guilt.</em><br />
            <em>The robe has slid down  around her shoulders.&nbsp; Her upper back,  exposed to the cold tension, trembles from the weight of goose bumps on a  fragile soul; too close to the edge even the simplest touch can push her over.</em><br />
            <em>&quot;Amelia,&quot; a  voice whispers behind her, he didn't say <u>her</u> name...the son of a bitch  has the nerve to dream of another.</em><br />
            <em>&quot;Come back, you  know I love you,&quot; this action of theirs means nothing to him!&nbsp; Is she just another girl, an imitation of  Amelia?</em><br />
            <em>She drops her robe  around her ankles, releasing her body to the cold crisp air of jealousy.&nbsp; Her lower lip begins to tremble, the dam has  cracked and water starts seeping through; soon the pressure builds and a river  releases itself.&nbsp; She looks back into the  voids, lower lip quivering in her insecurity, tears making her cheeks radiant  with anger.</em><br />
            <em>&quot;I need your  help.&quot;</em></p>
        <p><strong>Like a faithful pet it  points to the prey, but there is only darkness.&nbsp;  He must be dreaming again, dreaming of her.&nbsp; It remembers her, how could it forget.&nbsp; It shares her with everything it has met.&nbsp; Now she remains on the tongue, and the  insides of half of the city.&nbsp; The  vibrations have stopped, silence?&nbsp; Where  has the voice gone?&nbsp; It never felt the  slamming of a door.</strong></p>
        <p>&quot;Well they  don't!&quot;&nbsp; What type of crap does he  know?&nbsp; He doesn't know me, sure as hell  doesn't know me.<br />
  &quot;Somewhere down there  they do Jack.&quot;<br />
  &quot;You're fuc-you're  wrong, you have no idea what they mean to me.&quot;<br />
  &quot;I can imagine what  they could.&quot;<br />
  &quot;They can't mean  anything to me now.&quot;<br />
  &quot;And why not?&quot;<br />
  &quot;Someone chipped  their corner, and now they land on the same sides every dam-every time...&quot;<br />
  &quot;So what are you  going to do with them?&quot;<br />
  &quot;TOSS'EM ACCROSS THE  ROOM!&quot;&nbsp; Get off my case you  pathetic...<br />
  &quot;Maybe there's an  alternative.&quot;&nbsp; Room, Hotel Room, oh  my god the hotel is a block behind me!&nbsp;  I've let him distract me, I did not walk all this way just to...<br />
  &quot;Look...&quot;<br />
  &quot;Find another  pair.&quot;<br />
  &quot;I gotta-&quot;<br />
  &quot;Let yours fall as they  may Jack, and walk away.&quot;<br />
  &quot;I gotta go.&quot;<br />
  &quot;Find another pair,  and play again.&quot;</p>
        <p><em>&quot;He always leaves  it on the chair Jill,&quot; it gestures towards the desk chair behind her.</em><br />
            <em>Jill walks over and  looks at his navy blue jacket, throws it aside like Kleenex, and looks at the  gun holster; hanging from the pole like a monkey with a one handed death  grip.&nbsp; She takes the gun, checks for  ammunition...the son of a bitch. never trusted anyone, all eight bullets in the  chamber.&nbsp; She quietly walks over to his  side of the bed, and collapses, like drooping rose petals, into a crouch.</em><br />
            <em>&quot;Baby,&quot; she  whispered.</em><br />
            <em>&quot;Open your  eyes.&quot;</em></p>
        <p><strong>The vibrations are  slight, she's still in the room.&nbsp; Is she  asking for more?&nbsp; He's waking up.&nbsp; All the muscles around it tense up as he stretches.&nbsp; He certainly thinks she wants more; &quot;hey  baby what are you doin&rsquo;?&quot;&nbsp; Maybe she  has something a little rough in mind, it likes it a little slower usually but  it's been awhile.&nbsp; &quot;SHIT!&quot;&nbsp; A loud bang, and a very sudden shutter inside  of it.&nbsp; Its insides start to leave it  cold, rushing to a release of pressure.&nbsp;  He isn't moving, and its losing feeling.&nbsp;  This is death, another vibration from a bang, but this time no shudder,  not in its senior's body.&nbsp; Slowly it  swoons down, for the last time.&nbsp; It'll  never have to work again, the villain has found its weakness, and it couldn't  stop lead.</strong></p>
        <p>&quot;CHRIST!&quot;&nbsp; I yell as I turn around, though I don't think  he was anywhere near those two gun shots, &quot;what the hell was that?&quot;<br />
          The man didn't respond,  strange, the one moment where I want to talk to someone and he's doesn't talk  back.&nbsp; My heart is pounding in my chest,  striking down my front with lightning of sudden anxiety.&nbsp; I want to walk one more block...but I'm not  going to.&nbsp; I'm turning around, I'm going  to let them fall as they may, and I'm going to walk away.&nbsp; Yep, he's gone, but...that's funny  looking'.&nbsp; Right were he stood, a dove's  feather floats down in the cold night air.&nbsp;  Innocently white, it glows on the surface, and the light that shines  through to the other side of it is brighter than before.&nbsp; Like a ray of hope, it floats ahead of  me...heh...<br />
  &quot;Some things are  worth preserving...&quot;</p>
