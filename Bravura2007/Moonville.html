        <h1>Vacation in Moonville</h1>
        <p>Jon Aretakis</p>
        <p align="left">Grady&rsquo;s bladder felt ready to burst  and the circulation in his legs had nearly stopped. He considered pulling over  to take a leak in the woods. However, he quickly realized being in the middle  of nowhere was not a valid reason for stupidity. The robbery had gone  flawlessly. He refused to risk an encounter with the authorities over a petty  offense. Besides, he had almost arrived at the cabin. He finally reached the  final stretch of his long drive. Highway 96. He could not figure out why anyone  would call it a highway, except perhaps because it was paved. It seemed a  scrawny road compared to the highways he traveled back East. The road weaved  its way along side the Klamath River, through countless acreage of forest and  into the heart of the Klamath Mountains. A road sign came into view.<br /></p>
          <p align="center"><strong>Moonville</strong><br />
          Population: Unknown<br />
          Elevation: 10,250  feet.</p>
        <p>He drove further down the road and  saw another sign: GAS. The sign stood just off the Highway in a dirt lot. A  small convenience store with a garage on one side stood toward the back of the  lot. Two green and white gas pumps with plastic shaped dinosaur emblems on top  stood in front of the store. Grady pulled into the gas station, parked next to  the gas pumps, stepped out of his rental car and walked briskly but tensely  toward the entrance.<br />
          As he stepped inside, the pungent  smell of cigar smoke filled his nostrils. He immediately spotted the bathroom  and darted into it in search of relief. A few moments later, the sound of the  toilet flushing might as well have been bells going off in heaven. Grady felt  better. As he walked out of the bathroom, he realized his long journey across  the United States in the gutless rental was officially over. He had arrived and  would soon be drinking beer while counting his share of the loot. Life felt  good. He felt good. Everything felt good. If anyone asked, he was officially on  vacation.<br />
          A short elderly man with a bulging  belly and a scruffy gray beard sat on a stool behind a counter and puffed on a  cigar. He sat next to a small table that had a handful of clear stones, a few  yellow nuggets and a sawed-off shotgun on it. He held one of the clear stones  up to the light of a nearby window and studied it. As Grady approached the  counter, the elderly man put the clear stone on the table, stood up from the  stool and approached the cash register. Grady noticed the elderly man&rsquo;s left  eye was made of glass. He could not help but observe the glass eye because the  painted silhouette of a naked woman covered its center. While the elderly man&rsquo;s  right eye looked up slightly at Grady, his glass eye never moved. It stared  straight ahead. Grady looked at the man&rsquo;s fake eye several times just to make  sure he was not hallucinating. The sight brought a faint smile to Grady&rsquo;s face.  The man stood behind the counter, puffed vigorously on his cigar and grimaced  at Grady. <br />
  &ldquo;Good day, mister. How can I help  you?&rdquo;<br />
  &ldquo;Just the necessities. Gas, beer,  cigarettes and whiskey.&rdquo; <br />
  &ldquo;Easy enough. You just passing  through?&rdquo;<br />
  &ldquo;On vacation. Meeting a friend at a  cabin on Red Forest Mountain. We&rsquo;re going to spend a few days fishing. Is Red  Forest road close?&rdquo;<br />
  &ldquo;We&rsquo;re at the base of Red Forest  Mountain. Take the next left off the highway, right after the Trading Post.  That&rsquo;s Red Forest road. There&rsquo;s no road sign. It&rsquo;s a dirt road, but it travels  all right until it rains. Then it makes for a slippery ride.&rdquo; <br />
  &ldquo;Going fishing are you? The  fishing&rsquo;s one of the main reasons I moved here. I love fishing. That and mining  minerals. When I&rsquo;m not sleeping, mining minerals or fixing a car, I&rsquo;m standing  next to the Klamath trying to coax those trout out of the water with the use of  my fishing pole and a shiny lure. My favorite part is flipping those slippery  little creatures in a frying pan with some butter.&rdquo;<br />
          Grady stared at the gems on the  small table behind the counter. &ldquo;Are those gold nuggets?&rdquo;<br />
  &ldquo;They are. Gold nuggets and a  handful of uncut diamonds.&rdquo;<br />
          Instantly, he considered robbing the old man but decided to  pass on the sudden opportunity since he already had a trunk full of money. The  gems looked to be a nice score but why risk it. He could buy all the gems he  wanted once he crossed the border. Still, he found it a difficult invitation to  pass up.<br />
  &ldquo;You find them around here?&rdquo;<br />
  &ldquo;I do. Diamonds the hardest to  locate, but they my favorite. After I cut them, they reflect light just like  stars. That&rsquo;s what makes them my favorite. They like little stars. You drive up  from the city?&rdquo;<br />
  &ldquo;I did. Hell of a drive too.&rdquo;<br />
          Grady had a hard time taking his  eyes off the gems. The old man walked back to the small table, picked up the  gold nuggets and diamonds and slid them into his pants pocket. He picked up the  sawed-off shotgun and slid it into his leg holster.<br />
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll check your fluids and tire  pressure too. After a long drive on roads like these, better to be safe and do  a quick check on the car. You in a hurry?&rdquo;<br />
  &ldquo;Not at all. I need to stretch my  legs. Appreciate you checking the car out for me. You&rsquo;re right, can&rsquo;t be too  safe.&rdquo;<br />
  &ldquo;My pleasure.&rdquo;<br />
          Grady walked over to the refrigerator, opened the door and pulled  out a twelve pack of his favorite beer. He opened the twelve-pack, removed a  can of beer, set the twelve-pack on the counter near the cash register and  followed the old man outside to the gas pumps. He sat down, leaned up against  one of the gas pumps, cracked open the beer and stared up at Red Forest  Mountain. &ldquo;It sure is beautiful around here. Why do they call it Moonville?&rdquo;<br />
  &ldquo;Because of the full moons,&rdquo;  remarked the old man as he used a tire pressure gauge to check one of the  tires. &ldquo;Sometimes they are so full, seem down right magical. As the story goes,  back in the eighteen hundreds an old miner around these parts panning gold from  the Klamath would spend his night&rsquo;s staring at those full moons. One day while  panning, he grabbed himself a chisel with hammer and etched the word Moonville  into a large boulder down by the river. To this day, it&rsquo;s still etched in that  boulder too, right down by the Klamath. Year&rsquo;s later surveyors came into the  area. That there Highway was nothing but a horse trail. Those surveyors mapped  the area and made plans for putting in the highway. Besides being mystified by  the full moons, them surveyors took notice of that boulder and officially  dubbed the area Moonville. People round these parts mighty proud of this town.  There isn&rsquo;t a place like it anywhere.&rdquo; <br />
          The old man finished checking the  tire pressure in the rest of the tires. He reached through the open window of  the rental car and pulled the latch that popped the hood. He walked to the  front of the car, lifted the hood, pulled an oily rag from his pocket and began  to check the fluid levels.<br />
  &nbsp;&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t miss the moon and stars around  here. When the moon in full bloom, it and a trillion stars appear so close, the  Milky Way herself seems only a rocks throw away.&rdquo;&nbsp; <br />
          The old man walked to the side of  the car, unscrewed the gas cap, pulled a gas pump nozzle from one of the pumps  and inserted it into the car&rsquo;s gas tank. He flipped a lever on the gas pump and  began to fill the tank.<br />
  &ldquo;These gas pumps look like refurnished  antiques?&rdquo;<br />
  &ldquo;They&rsquo;re original Bennett Sinclair  Dino gas pumps. When I first found them, they were all busted, rusted and shot  up. Ruined by the wind, the rain and any misfit who had a chance to throw a  rock or put a bullet through them. Only thing they were good for back then was  making a noise when one of their parts hit the ground or whistling when the  wind hit them just right. There was just something about the place that seemed  to deserve saving, so I fixed her up. Ran off the raccoons that were living in  the shack and rebuilt most of it. It took time, but I finally finished it.  Mighty proud of it too. You won&rsquo;t find gas pumps like them anymore. They living  fossils.&rdquo; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Grady stood, gulped down the rest of his beer, tossed the empty can into  a near-by trashcan, stretched and inhaled deeply. &ldquo;Everything smells so fresh.  Where I come from it isn&rsquo;t like that.&rdquo;<br />
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in Moonville. Like I said  before, it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s country. I&rsquo;ll tell you something about Moonville. The people  of Moonville are different then others. The moon so big it changes people if  they stay around here long enough. I can feel the changes. More importantly,  they don&rsquo;t take kindly to strangers. There are many spectacular beauties around  here and we aim to protect them. A word of warning, mind your manners and don&rsquo;t  liter. Locals don&rsquo;t take kindly to outsiders trashing this beautiful place.&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep the information in mind, appreciate  the advice.&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Just trying to be helpful.&rdquo;<br />
          The old man closed the hood of the car and finished filling the  gas tank. <br />
  &ldquo;All finished. She&rsquo;s good to go.  Step into my office and I&rsquo;ll ring you up.&rdquo;<br />
          Grady paid what he owed and thanked  the old man for his help. He stepped back into his rental car and headed for  the cabin. <br />
          With the driver&rsquo;s side window down,  Grady drove up Road Forest road while he sipped on another beer. He noticed the  sun was setting and some dark rain clouds were moving in overhead. He inhaled  deeply, filling his lungs with the crisp mountain air. He continued up the  mountain until he noticed a mailbox with the numbers 313. He pulled a piece of  paper from his shirt pocket. It read 313 Red Forest road. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He pulled  up to a cabin, parked his rental, grabbed the twelve-pack and stepped out of  the car. As he approached the front door, it swung open and a man dressed in  black stepped out. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You made  it.&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I did, as  did you.&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;We did it.  This time next week we&rsquo;re down South with new identities.&rdquo; <br />
  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll live like kings.&rdquo; <br />
  &ldquo;That we will.&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I have a new plan,&rdquo; said the man in black as  he smiled and pulled a marijuana joint from his coat pocket. &ldquo;First, we&rsquo;re gong  to smoke this joint and then we&rsquo;re going to get shit faced drunk and some where  in between we&rsquo;re going to take a ride down to that store, the Trading Post, for  food and supplies.&rdquo; <br />
  &ldquo;We should be careful. We&rsquo;re still  in the United States?&rdquo; <br />
  &ldquo;Yeah, but they isn&rsquo;t looking for  us here. The cops looking for us on the other side of the United States, so  relax. All we going to do is relax a little.&rdquo;<br />
          As they drove down to the store,  the sky turned dark and the rain started to come down. Grady remembered he had  forgotten to remove the stolen money from the trunk. The thought quickly  disintegrated into the crisp mountain air when the man in black handed him the  bottle of whiskey and he took a swig. <br />
          As they entered the Trading Post,  Grady noticed an eleven-foot tall wooden statue of a Bigfoot. The statue stood  in a near-by corner and had been cut from a single tree. By the looks of it,  Grady guessed it to be chainsaw art. He thought it carried a certain artistic  flare. Florescent lights stretched across the ceiling, flickering illumination  over the large room. The smell of damp wood and fresh brewed coffee filled the  air. Signs hung on the walls: Fresh Bait, Bamboo Fishing Poles Half Off and Ice  Cold Beer. Racks filled with fishing, hunting and camping merchandise lined the  floor and walls. A few baskets filled with lemons, oranges and apples sat on a  table next to the main display counter.<br />
  &nbsp;The main display counter was mainly made of  glass and crowded with handguns and knives of every size. Behind the counter, a  gun rack stocked with rifles and shotguns was mounted on the wall. A Native  American Indian, with long silver-gray hair, dressed in Levi&rsquo;s and an Indian  poncho sat behind the counter on a wooden stool and played his guitar.&nbsp; As Grady and the man in black approached the  counter, the Indian moved slowly from his stool to greet them.<br />
  &ldquo;Evening gentleman, what can I do  for you?&rdquo;<br />
  &ldquo;We need some supplies,&rdquo; said the  man in black.<br />
  &ldquo;That is an interesting statue,&rdquo;  said Grady.<br />
  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a Bigfoot, the great legend  of these parts.&rdquo;<br />
  &ldquo;Have you ever seen one?&rdquo; asked  Grady<br />
          The Indian smirked. &ldquo;Only in my  imagination, they don&rsquo;t exist. Just Indian myth created by dreamers, who&rsquo;ve  usually had too much to drink.&rdquo;<br />
          The first thing Grady noted when  the stranger entered the Trading Post was the sheriff&rsquo;s badge. Grady watched as  the sheriff took off his cowboy hat, shook the rainwater from the rim and  walked toward the main counter. Grady did not say a word to the man in black. They  knew what to do. They calmly gathered up some groceries and headed for the  counter. Grady wished he had his gun on him but he had left it in the glove  compartment of the car. He felt relived when the sheriff reached into his  jacket pocket, pulled out a flask of whiskey, unscrewed the cap, tipped the  flask to his lips and took a swig. He must be off duty, thought Grady.<br />
  &ldquo;Just need to use your restroom.  Won&rsquo;t be a minute,&rdquo; said the sheriff.<br />
  &ldquo;Whatever you need sheriff,&rdquo;  responded the Indian.<br />
          Grady realized they had a small  window of time to pay for the groceries and get out of the store. While at the  register, Grady grew impatient. The Indian man seemed to take forever while  ringing up the groceries. The sheriff would come out of the bathroom at any  moment. The last thing Grady wanted was to have a conversation with the man  wearing the badge. However, just as the thought floated through Grady&rsquo;s mind,  the sheriff came out of the bathroom and walked toward the counter. Shit! Fuck!  I don&rsquo;t need this right now, thought Grady in a silent panic.<br />
  &ldquo;Evening gentlemen. Didn&rsquo;t expect  to see any strangers in here tonight. Not a wise night to be out traveling.  It&rsquo;s really coming down out there. You boys just passing through?&rdquo; <br />
  &ldquo;We&rsquo;re staying in my cabin up the  road for a few days on vacation. Going to do some fishing.&rdquo; <br />
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Welcome to Moonville. My name&rsquo;s Earl, Earl  Woods, but you can just call me Woods.&rdquo; <br />
  &ldquo;Nice to meet you sheriff,&rdquo; said  Grady.<br />
          Grady and the man in black finished  paying for their groceries and politely exited the Trading Post. <br />
          As they drove down the Highway,  white veins of lightening lit up the dark sky. The loud crack of thunder  rumbled, a heavy rain poured down and a thick blanket of fog rolled over the  forest floor. As Grady turned onto Red Forest road, the car slid sideways.<br />
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo; screamed the man in black as he  grabbed onto the safety handle above the passenger side window. Grady jerked  the steering wheel, trying to regain control. <br />
  &ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; screamed Grady. The car  spun out of control and came to an abrupt stop. The engine died. <br />
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a scary driver.&rdquo;<br />
  &ldquo;Shit happens,&rdquo; responded Grady.<br />
  &ldquo;Yeah, apparently when you drive.&rdquo;<br />
  &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just get back to the cabin.&rdquo;<br />
          Grady turned the key. The car did not start. <br />
  &ldquo;Now what?&rdquo;<br />
  &ldquo;Patience. It&rsquo;ll start, probably  just flooded.&rdquo;<br />
          Grady reached into one of the grocery bags and pulled out a  few beers. He handed one to his partner, cracked open the other and took a  drink. <br />
          Grady stared through the  windshield. The lights from the car illuminated the rain.<br />
          Grady noticed something large move  through the beams of the headlights.<br />
  &ldquo;Did you see that? Something moved  out there.&rdquo;<br />
  &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see anything?&rdquo;<br />
  &ldquo;Something is out there.&rdquo;<br />
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re high. It&rsquo;s your  imagination. There&rsquo;s nothing out there in this storm?&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grady  chugged the rest of his beer, rolled down the window and threw the empty can  out. He turned the key and the car started. <br />
  &ldquo;I saw something and it was alive  and large. Whatever it was, we&rsquo;re leaving it behind.&rdquo; Suddenly a large, hairy  creature appeared in front of the car. It raised it arms over its head, slammed  its fists into the hood of the car and let out a horrific roar. It bent down,  picked up the front of the car and flipped it end over end, sending it flying a  short distance down the road.&nbsp; <br />
  &ldquo;Holy shit,&rdquo; screamed the man in  black.<br />
  &ldquo;I told you there was something out  there.&rdquo;<br />
          A large hairy hand smashed through  the passenger side window and yanked the man in black from the car by his hair.  Grady reached into the glove compartment and pulled out his pistol. He heard  the man in black scream and whimper in agony. He crawled from the car and  watched as the large creature tore the man in black&rsquo;s head off. Grady steadied  his shaking hands, raised his pistol and fired until the gun was empty. The  creature took numerous shots to the head. It stumbled to one knee. With both  hands, the creature brushed offensively at its head wounds. With anger in its  eyes, it peered at Grady. It dropped its chin to its chest as apricot size  blood drops ran down its face and splashed on the ground. It raised back its  head, stared up into the sky, let out a horrific cry and dropped dead.<br />
          Grady walked over to the man in  black, who was missing his head. Grady knew it was pointless to try and help  him. He was definitely dead. Better to grab the money and get back to the  cabin. Grady walked to the trunk, which had been popped open due to the attack  and grabbed the duffel bag filled with cash. He noticed car headlights coming  toward him. The car pulled up next to him and came to a stop. The sheriff and  the Indian stepped out. <br />
  &ldquo;We heard shots fired. What  happened?&rdquo;<br />
  &ldquo;Sheriff, I&rsquo;m happy to see you.  That creature attacked the car and killed my friend. Ripped his head clean  off.&rdquo;<br />
          Grady pointed to the dead creature  but suddenly realized it was not a mysterious creature at all. It was the old  man from the gas station. The old man was naked and his eyes were open. Grady  looked into the old man&rsquo;s eyes and noticed the painted silhouette of a naked  woman.<br />
          The sheriff walked over and picked  up the empty can that Grady had tossed out the window. <br />
  &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t take kindly to people who  liter.&rdquo;<br />
  &ldquo;No, we sure don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the  Indian.<br />
  &ldquo;You want him?&rdquo; asked the sheriff  to the Indian.<br />
  &ldquo;Figure I do. But I&rsquo;m not going to  ruin my clothes.&rdquo;<br />
          The Indian took off all of his  clothes, howled and turned into a giant Bigfoot.<br />
          Grady raised his gun and pulled the  trigger but his gun was empty.<br />
          The Bigfoot growled and hissed as  it moved closer to Grady.<br />
  &ldquo;Wait a minute. Sheriff, I have  money. Lots of money.&rdquo;<br />
          Grady quickly opened the bag and nervously  pulled out bundles of cash. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Son, you  can&rsquo;t give us anything we&rsquo;re not going to take after you&rsquo;re dead. You littered  and in Moonville that means you die. Don&rsquo;t worry. We don&rsquo;t waste. After we&rsquo;ve  killed you, we&rsquo;ll eat you,&rdquo; said the sheriff while he took off his clothes and  turned into an enormous hairy Bigfoot with massive muscles.<br />
          Grady tried to run but escape was  futile. The creatures jumped on top of him and tore him to pieces. Grady&rsquo;s body  parts flew through the air and his blood soiled the ground. As he lay on the  ground and his limbs were being ripped from his torso, he noticed the storm had  cleared and the moon was the fullest and the biggest moon he had ever seen. It  was a beautiful moon, he thought.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
