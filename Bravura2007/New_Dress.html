        <h1><strong>A New Dress </strong></h1>
        <br />
        <p><strong>A New Dress</strong><br />
          Karina Grifka</p>
        <p>All I wanted this past summer was for two hot boys to find  me fabulously irresistible.&nbsp; But oh well.  It&rsquo;s alright I guess &lsquo;cause that would have been so time consuming and our  German Shepards would have been lonely and the weeds would have taken over  Grandma&rsquo;s rose bushes out front.&nbsp; I still  need an occasion to wear my new dress.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>My mom said the dress looks like one she once saw Princess  Diana wearing in a photo with skinny little black kids, but I don&rsquo;t know about  that &lsquo;cause I modeled it after the one that Audrey Hepburn wears to the party  in Sabrina, except I sewed mine from our old red table cloth after Dad got a  brand new one from Amish country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Anyway, it would have been absolutely perfect for that  evening, the final evening with my two suitors when I would make my  decision.&nbsp; I can just picture it: a  crackling fire, me in my dress, the gifts, their snide comments toward each  other, Kentucky Fried Chicken.&nbsp; My  parents would be away which wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem &lsquo;cause they often go on  vacations without me.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>The boys would be aching for me, which would make it all the  more rewarding when I would finally tell them I was dumping both of them and  traveling off to Paris to &ldquo;find myself.&rdquo;&nbsp;  This would of course be followed by a kinky m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois on the living room rug.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>My sister, it seems always had an excuse to get out of the  house, &ldquo;Joe&rsquo;s taking me to dinner&hellip;the movies&hellip;the fair&hellip;Please Dad? He could  propose any day! Hey, thanks Mom. Blah blah blah.&rdquo; Since there weren&rsquo;t any hot  men in the picture, I had no excuse.&nbsp; No  reason why I couldn&rsquo;t spend all vacation collecting eggs, so my summer was  filled with chickens and cows and pigs and Bobby Fairbanks.&nbsp; Well at least Bobby offered to help me milk  the cows but I think he just didn&rsquo;t have anything better to do.&nbsp; Standing in the middle of our barn actually  made that stupid purple tie he always wears look even more out of place than  usual.&nbsp; No wonder everyone at school  calls him a fag.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>This girl in my class told me that in England cigarettes are  called fags.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never smoked a  cigarette though &lsquo;cause I don&rsquo;t want to die of lung cancer like Grandma.&nbsp; But I guess I did &ldquo;smoke a fag&rdquo; this summer  if you know what I mean.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p>I told Bobby not to tell anybody.</p>
        <p>I don&rsquo;t know if he had planned it or what.&nbsp; That afternoon I was listening to some old  Louis Armstrong records my grandpa gave me when Bobby came banging on my screen  door, telling me to come with him because he had found a dead body out in the  woods where we couldn&rsquo;t drive.&nbsp; I told  him he was full of shit, that he had totally ripped that off from the movie  Stand by Me but I went with him anyway &lsquo;cause I had already finished my chores  and I was bored and I had no one else to hang out with.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p>I grabbed my purse and walked out through the living  room.&nbsp; My sister was lounging on the  sofa, working a new hole into the threadbare upholstery with her  fingertips.&nbsp; I waved but she just stared  at the big screen TV, some fuzzy special on celebrities and the houses and cars  that they love.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Bobby was looking at this photo I love of my grandfather in  uniform with grandma on his arm. They looked like a movie star couple from the  fifties.&nbsp; Grandpa had the strongest chin,  so refined, not like boys today.&nbsp; When I  was little I would sit by his feet and we&rsquo;d listen to some jazz record or  another and he would tell me all these stories about the war, but only the nice  war stories and also ones about him and grandma when they were dating.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was all very romantic, even though he  would always call all the black people niggers.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Bobby asked about the photo, but I just grabbed his arm and  dragged him outside.&nbsp; We crossed the  field near my house and entered the woods.&nbsp;  I noticed a new breeze sweeping through the tall pines and across my  face.&nbsp; It was the first day in weeks I  didn&rsquo;t have sweat coating my forehead and the backs of my knees. </p>
        <p>I hadn&rsquo;t been into the woods in at least a couple  years.&nbsp; It was quieter than I remembered. </p>
        <p>I stopped when we came to a  familiar spot, a small clearing between four trees.&nbsp; When I was eight I had run away from home to  this very spot for two days with nothing but a sleeping bag, a supply of  goldfish crackers and a box of apple juice.&nbsp;  I had forgotten a flashlight.&nbsp; At  least it was quiet.&nbsp; Jazz records are  crap for drowning out screaming. </p>
        <p>I thought of Ella Fitgerald&rsquo;s  creamy voice pouring from the record player in my bedroom interrupted by the  agonizing cries of my grandfather.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d  had had a stroke a few years prior, just after grandma died and all he could  say was lo.&nbsp; Lo lo lo lo lo lo lo.&nbsp; Now every so often, he would suddenly be  struck by this horrible pain through his whole body.&nbsp; Doctors didn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; We couldn&rsquo;t afford tests.&nbsp; So Ella&rsquo;s trying to get a word in &ldquo;It's  autumn in New York that brings the promise of new love &hellip;lo lo lo&hellip; Autumn in New  York is often mingled with pain &hellip;lo lo lo lo lo.&rdquo; And dad, feeling a little  feisty from pouring back a few too many, screams something over the blasting  television about living in a goddamn crazy house.&nbsp; I only went into grandpa&rsquo;s room once since  the stroke.&nbsp; He just wasn&rsquo;t right.&nbsp; An emptiness in his eyes.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t stand to see him there.&nbsp; I knew he would die in that bed.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Suddenly I felt warm moist breath on the back of my neck  followed by a hand going down my top, groping my right breast, squeezing  rhythmically like it was milking a cow.&nbsp;  I stood there for for a few seconds, staring at clusters of brown pine  needles and fallen branches on the ground and then&nbsp; I turned around and saw Bobby biting his  lower lip, his blue eyes looking everywhere but my face, his brown tweed pants  down around his ankles.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Well, what the hell. </p>
        <p>I dropped to my knees.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>A few minutes later, the twigs were digging into my back  through the thin cotton layer of my dress and Bobby was on top of me.&nbsp; His eyes were squeezed shut and his freckled  forehead was clenched tight like he was trying to do a complicated physics  problem in his head.&nbsp; The front of my teal  cotton circle skirt was bunched around my stomach.&nbsp; I stared at the tall pine tree behind him  where, on that second day eight years ago I had been hunched over on the ground  in tears because nobody had come to look for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Afterward I noticed some sticky spots and crimson droplets  on the back of my skirt.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know I  would bleed.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad I wasn&rsquo;t wearing  my Sabrina dress.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>I leaned back down. Bobby was lying next to me on his  back.&nbsp; We looked up at the clouds, those  wispy ones with grey around the edges.&nbsp;  It would rain soon.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Sorry about your dress,&rdquo; he said.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;No big, it&rsquo;s kinda ugly anyway.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Bobby promised to buy me a new dress.&nbsp; He told me all about his plan to quit school  and run away to New York City in November when he turns sixteen.&nbsp; He wants to become a writer.&nbsp; He said he would buy it from one of the fancy  boutiques there and send it to me.&nbsp; I  told him not to.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>&ldquo;Train ride&rsquo;s an hour and a half,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;You should  visit.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Tickets are expensive.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>He pulled a joint out of his pocket and lit it.&nbsp; He put it to his lips then handed it to  me.&nbsp; Everyone here smokes &lsquo;cause there&rsquo;s  nothing better to do.&nbsp; Probably even the  old folks.&nbsp; We suspect the retirement  home is just one big hot box.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>I held my breath and looked up at the clouds.&nbsp; This big round cloud with two trunk looking  things coming out each end kind of looked like the torso of this morbidly obese  600 pound woman I once saw in a group photo of all the freaks in the Barnum and  Bailey Circus from the &lsquo;30&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I thought  about all those poor freaks and how I couldn&rsquo;t feel too bad about them &lsquo;cause  they probably were only sneered and gawked at for a few hours a day but then  got to go out and live it up in New York or Chicago or wherever in some swanky  bar.&nbsp; Maybe the eight foot tall woman and  the three and a half foot tall man from the photo got all dolled up and went  out dancing together.&nbsp; I pictured her  gracefully carrying him across the floor then something fell out of the  dream&hellip;uh, the sky and hit with a thud several yards away.</p>
        <p>I sat up and looked at Bobby, &ldquo;What the hell was that?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Bobby looked at me wide- eyed. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s a piece of the  Russian space station.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>We stood up and walked over to where we heard the  sound.&nbsp; I put the joint to my lips and  crouched down to get a better look.</p>
        <p>A tiny, perfect white sparrow was lying on one wing,  motionless in the dirt.&nbsp; I let out my  breath, &ldquo;Dead bird.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Bobby sat down next to me.&nbsp;  He stared at the bird.&nbsp; &ldquo;See?&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;I told you&hellip;a dead body.&rdquo;&nbsp; He let  out a coy, high pitched laugh like a little school- girl; the laugh that makes  me cringe when we are around other people.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>He got quiet and sat gazing at it for a minute before  turning to me, &ldquo;Nothing can happen more beautiful than death,&rdquo; he said.</p>
        <p>I glanced at his mouth.&nbsp;  It always had something to say.&nbsp;  &ldquo;What are you babbling about?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Walt Whitman.&nbsp; He has  the most amazing words.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s  inside my brain.&nbsp; Like he defines me  somehow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bobby paused and looked back  at the bird.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s this line that  goes &lsquo;Give me odorous at sunrise a garden of  beautiful flowers where I can walk undisturbed.&rsquo;&rdquo; He looked back at me, his  green eyes lit up. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that wonderful? It&rsquo;s a beautiful idea, don&rsquo;t you  think?&rdquo; <br />
            <br />
          The bird was starting to creep me out.&nbsp; I swear I saw it move.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t Walt Whitman just a big closet case?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Bobby got up off the ground and looked down at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go get milkshakes at Dennys.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
        <p>He ordered strawberry and I ordered Vanilla.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve barely talked to him since that  day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Bobby is leaving in a few weeks and I promised not to tell  his dad about his plan, like he promised not to say anything about us.&nbsp; But I noticed the boys at school have been  looking at me differently this year.&nbsp; I  was coughed at a few times with the word slut.&nbsp;  I guess that&rsquo;s better than loser.&nbsp;  And Bobby never gets bruises anymore.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Yesterday I was sitting in Starbucks reading an article in  the culture section of the New York Times.&nbsp;  It was about a new jazz club in an old fancy building in Manhattan that  reminded me of the party scene in Sabrina.&nbsp;  Bobby&rsquo;s dad walked in alone in his janitor&rsquo;s uniform and ordered a large  cup of coffee, black.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>I found out this morning that a train ticket to New York  costs sixty- five dollars for students.&nbsp;  Round Trip.&nbsp; I guess that&rsquo;s not so  expensive.&nbsp; </p>
