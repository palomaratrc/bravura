        <h1><strong>A Pretty City  in the Dark</strong></h1><br />
          Jason Schenheit
      <P>Riley keeps the kitchen spotless for fear of  not keeping old things new.&nbsp; Standing in  her tiled sanctuary finishing the dishes a slowness creeps in.&nbsp; She lives in her little apartment by herself,  though she never feels alone.&nbsp; Drying the  water out of a bowl, checking the molded glass against the light, she notices his  faint reflection in the window glass.&nbsp; At  first&nbsp; she hardly recognizes his  distinctive stare, but now she sees.&nbsp;  It&rsquo;s been a while, but he&rsquo;s standing there again.           &nbsp;He  stands with the photo album from her bookshelf, running his hand over the  cracked burgandy cover.&nbsp;</p>
      <P> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s with all  the dust on this album?&rdquo;<br />
        Riley glances at the glass, &ldquo;What was  that?&rdquo;<br />
&quot;I saw her the other day you  know,&quot; he says, beginning to flip through the glossy pictures. <br />
&quot;Saw who the other day?&quot;<br />
&quot;Who do you think? The girl in this  picture album.&quot;<br />
&ldquo;I told you before how fragile my album is  in some places, besides I can&rsquo;t get any of those back if you ruin them.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Look at you with that lip ring,&rdquo; he said,  continuing to flip. &nbsp;&ldquo;I could hardly  recognize you anymore; it&rsquo;s like you don&rsquo;t exist!&rdquo; <br />
Riley continues to wash.&nbsp; She thinks she hears anger, even disgust in  his voice, but isn&rsquo;t sure. He paces back and forth in front of kitchen moving in  and out of her view.&nbsp; She studies his  image, noticing how the forms of his face change with every page.<br />
&quot;Are you still doing something tonight  with Jake?&rdquo; he says. &nbsp;<br />
She hears the question from the living  room, &quot;At nine I think.&quot; <br />
He stops flipping to gaze at a page. &quot;Where?&quot; <br />
&quot;I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;&nbsp; She hesitates. &nbsp;&ldquo;I still have to call him?&quot; <br />
She air dries the last plate before towel  drying it.&nbsp; He stops in front of the  window;&nbsp; she catches the reflection of  his face as it changes into a smile.<br />
He says, &quot;Do you remember that yellow  dress you wore to the funeral?&quot; <br />
She stops and puts both hands on the edge  of the sink, leaning in with her upper weight.&nbsp; <br />
&quot;You&rsquo;re so beautiful in yellow! Why  don&rsquo;t you wear it anymore?&quot;<br />
&quot;It&rsquo;s October, way too cold for dresses.&nbsp; Besides, that dress would be old and tattered  by now.&quot;<br />
She wipes the counter clean, folds the  towel, and checks the kitchen for any mistakes.&nbsp;  Making her way to the living room, she turns off the light. The living  room, once lit by the kitchen glow, goes dim.&nbsp;  As she enters the living room, she feels its disorder, its many  mistakes.&nbsp; Looking at the digitial clock  on the DVD player, she sees it flashing 12:00.<br />
&quot;Do you still even own that yellow  dress?&rdquo; he says, turning the page finally as he speaks.<br />
&quot;It&rsquo;s somewhere in my closet. I  haven&rsquo;t worn it since that day.&quot;<br />
&quot;You should find that dress and wear  it like you do in these pictures.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;maybe.&rdquo;<br />
The room goes quiet. Riley sits on the love  seat staring into her entwining fingers.&nbsp;  He stops pacing nearing the end of the album.&nbsp; Breaking the stillness, she stands, walks  over, and turns on the main light.<br />
&quot;Look how happy everyone looks in this  picture for that party.&quot; &nbsp;He turns  the album, holding the picture at eye level for her to see.&nbsp; She remembers the picture, her birthday at  O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s, the smell of old beer and sweet liquor fills her memory.<br />
&quot;That picture was taken like three  years ago,&quot; she says moving away from him.<br />
&quot;Yeah, people always look so happy in  photos don&rsquo;t they?&quot; &nbsp;<br />
He closes the album.<br />
&ldquo;Sometimes&hellip;&rdquo; she says, returning to the  kitchen.&nbsp; &ldquo;But the pictures don&rsquo;t show  everything.&rdquo;<br />
Waiting for his answer, she searches the  window again.&nbsp; But he is gone.&nbsp; Instead, she sees helfself.&nbsp; For an instant, she doesn&rsquo;t recognize the  face looking back.&nbsp; Then, all at once,  she sees her new self, as clear as a photograph.</p>
