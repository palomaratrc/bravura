        <h1>Tales of Bus City</h1>
          <p>Matt Schnarr</p>
        <p>It had been a long day at  work.&nbsp; Jack's sense of time had flown out  the window along with all of his papers; never open your window on the seventy  fifth floor when everyone else's are closed.&nbsp;  He had left work burdened down by humiliation, and after seeing all of  his tires slashed flat he felt like he was standing before God with a leaf over  his dick.&nbsp; He had never ridden the bus  home before.&nbsp; This was his first bus ride  ever in fact.&nbsp; This man walked to school  as a young lad; although to him it was never walking to school, it was a daily  quest or adventure.&nbsp; This bus ride was no  adventure, all child like innocence was long gone.&nbsp; Jack just stared out the window and watched  as buildings and people passed by, ignoring the feeling that his life was doing  just that.&nbsp; This was a horrible day, a  record holding horrible day, an unbreakable record; hats off gentlemen this  ones a winner.&nbsp; The bus driver called out  the street name he had been waiting for, whether or not he actually heard it he  got up and walked to the door.&nbsp; On the  last step his foot got caught and he tripped, bringing all the events of the  day into one concrete wackaroo.&nbsp; Jack got  to his feet and looked around, so sheepishly he might as well have bah'd out of  embarrassment.&nbsp; This day couldn't get any  worse.&nbsp; While looking around he suddenly  caught the ethereal sight of a smile, between two lush lips, on a moonlight  face, around two pools of forgetfulness; Jack was a sucker for eyes.&nbsp; Losing all embarrassment he smiled back in  the utmost confidence, picked up his things, and started walking with a  straight spine again; maybe the day couldn't get any worse, but it certainly  could get better.</p>
        <p>So let me tell it to you  straight.&nbsp; I'm really not from the city,  I'm a country type, I was on my way to visit my friggin city cousin,  Murray.&nbsp; It had been a very strange  day.&nbsp; On the way to the city this bus  almost hit me, I don't even think that motha lova of a driva even tried to  avoid me; sixty nine, don't ever think I won't forget you, man, the nerve.&nbsp; So anywho, I keep walkin', and I finally make  it to the city.&nbsp; Yeah, let me tell you  that is a transformation of a life time.&nbsp;  Golden fields of angle hair wheat, and green gardens of love manifested  in roses...to grey tall structures of men overcompinsating.&nbsp; Alls they needed was copper statues of  themselves with huge mounds in their pants and it would have been a man's land  for sure.&nbsp; Thank god no one thinks like I  do.&nbsp; So I walk by one building in  particular, and this blizzard of flat papers just covers me.&nbsp; Not just hits my face, no sir, but buries me,  and I swear a pocket watch hit my head too...but I couldn't find a chronometer  in sight.&nbsp; I brushed myself off, and kept  walking.&nbsp; I walked by ghettos, and  basketball games half played and half dreamed, and I was about a block from the  alley where Murray was gonna meet me.&nbsp; I  stopped to sniff a hot dog when wouldn't you guess it, numero sixty nine pulls  up right next to me, the friggin cojones on this guy I'm telling you.&nbsp; So I figure the least I owe him is to relive  my bladder on his front tire.&nbsp; So I walk  up and start urinating, I would have spelled my name, but I honestly can't even  think how to spell Copernicus; especially when I'm urinating.&nbsp; About mid-pee this wise guy puts his foot  right into my stomach.&nbsp; Sends me rollin',  man, and I get covered in my own piss; talk about pissed, if I coulda I woulda  given him a piece of my mind.&nbsp; Sadly, he  was lost in some dame's eyes.&nbsp; I ditched  the scene, and came here.&nbsp; HEY!&nbsp; MURRAY!&nbsp;  Give me that half drunk can of seven up!&nbsp;  Give me a break I just walked twenty miles for you!&nbsp; Oh come on-ah whatever, the point I'm driving  at is that it is hard has hell being a possum.</p>
        <p>Ringing exited its insides  again.&nbsp; As the day had gone on it had  ringed more than a hundred times.&nbsp; Her  mother was trying to reach her, but seeing as she was no where near it she  never picked it up.&nbsp; It being a cell  phone, and having the only number she gives out to reach her it would be  difficult to do so if she wasn't near it.&nbsp;  It didn't understand where it lost her.&nbsp;  It remembered the donut shop in the morning, snuggled up in her purse  like a melting chocolate bar in a child's pocket; of course she ate the donut,  not the phone. The conversation about the pile of papers she walked by; a pile  of embarrassment and shame...with a breeze that could blow away the concept of  time.&nbsp; The picture she took of the mossy  tree with frozen morning dew covering its wanting leaves; like an ignored  prospect reaching out to you, sprinkled in romance.&nbsp; Where the hell does it get these similes and  metaphors?&nbsp; It's probably due to all the  conversation it conveys through vibrations and electricity.&nbsp; Gossip and predictions, dirt covered reality  and poetic fantasies.&nbsp; Of course now she  isn't in site, and the ringing does get on one's nerves; even if they don't  have any.&nbsp; It hears her voice, Thank  God!&nbsp; Back to its addictions; dramatic  exaggerations dipped into a melted coat of lies, flies and alibis.&nbsp; At one point it tired of this, but now it  cannot turn on without surrounding itself with it.&nbsp; She picks it up, &quot;Oh God,  mom?&quot;&nbsp; She presses its neglected  buttons, rushed, but producing warmth within it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Mom?&nbsp;  Mom?&nbsp; Are you-no mom, I can hear  you...No I can't.&nbsp; Mom?&nbsp; If you can hear me I'm going to step outside  for better reception.&nbsp; Bye.&quot;&nbsp; She walked down the hallway, and took a left  into an elevator.&nbsp; On the way down she  swayed back and forth to the music; if it knew that Lucy In the Sky With  Diamonds sounded good in tones it would have made it a default ring; it didn't,  it didn't, and it didn't.&nbsp; The elevator  shuddered to an orgasmic stop at the lobby.&nbsp;  Echoed in her resilience she stepped across the hallway; drowning in  voices that mattered as much to her as a shit coated pebble imbedded in a urine  covered possum.&nbsp; She stepped outside, and  dialed her mother with excited, yet wary fingers.&nbsp; &quot;Can you hear me n-good, yeah I can hear  you.&nbsp; Hi.&nbsp;  How are you?&nbsp; Good, I'm good.&nbsp; Yeah, I'm coming over tomorrow, I've been  looking forward to it all week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do I  remember who?&nbsp; No I don't, wait say the  name again.&quot;&nbsp; Suddenly it felt her  left cheek curl up against it, she was smiling.&nbsp;  Why would anyone smile on the phone with their mother?&nbsp; &quot;Jack Fienes?&nbsp; Yeah, I remember him.&nbsp; Why am I laughing?&nbsp; Its just weird.&nbsp; I'm actually looking at him right now.&nbsp; He just tripped on his way out of the  bus.&quot; That&rsquo;s concrete dirt covered reality for you.&nbsp; &quot;Yeah, he was always sort of a klutz.&nbsp; What's that?&nbsp;  Mom, my battery is dying, make it quick.&nbsp;  You were looking at my yearbook, and saw him.&nbsp; And you've been thinking of him all day up to  now?&nbsp; I have a feeling I'll be thinking  of him for the rest of it.&nbsp; Well he's  really cu--&quot;</p>
        <p>You've been driving all  day.&nbsp; You've been driving since you were  twenty one years old.&nbsp; You eat, sleep,  and drink driving.&nbsp; Not only that, but a  bus to you is a Twinkie to fat kid with pimples.&nbsp; When you wake up you take a shower and make  sure your smell matches up with the air refresher in the front of your  bus.&nbsp; No telling what obsessive  compulsive freak will spaz over how your smell doesn't bode well with the  atmosphere created by a paper thin tree shaped air mint.&nbsp; You don't drive to work, you wish you could,  but you don't.&nbsp; You live right next door  to your garage.&nbsp; Every morning you walk  over, and every morning you trip on the last step.&nbsp; One day your bad luck will remove itself from  you, and meld onto another.&nbsp; You drive  from the city to the country, and from the country to the city.&nbsp; A fifteen minute summary of the road trip  you'll never take.&nbsp; On your way back to  the city you see a possum waddling its way to your destination.&nbsp; You hate possums.&nbsp; You wish they would all die, and go to  hell.&nbsp; You don't avoid it, in fact you  drive as close to it as you possibly can.&nbsp;  Don't hit it, you'll get possum butts and guts all over your bus, that  would be bad, glorious, but the end result would be very bad.&nbsp; You freak the shit out of it, and keep  driving.&nbsp; It better not have gotten shit  on your car.&nbsp; Stupid possum.&nbsp; You drop everyone off at the first stop in  the city and then you pull over for a two hour nap.&nbsp; You love naps, not as much as driving, but  naps are the proverbial marshmallows on your hot chocolate; representing  driving, obviously.&nbsp; You wake up, and  look to your right, and you see a pile of papers.&nbsp; Who the hell drops papers on a random  sidewalk?&nbsp; You step out and look at one  of them.&nbsp; Who the hell is dumb enough to  drop a pile of papers with the names of everyone they're firing?&nbsp; You look up and see a group of people  surrounding a car.&nbsp; Four of whom have  knives.&nbsp; You hurry back into your bus,  safety in bus, knifes and cars never mixed very well.&nbsp; Your break is over, and you watch people get  on, checking for their money, or tickets.&nbsp;  A man steps out of the building next to you, and from your viewpoint  looks like he might as well be standing in a public park naked.&nbsp; You wait five minutes for the poor doop.&nbsp; He gets on your bus and sits in the back, all  depressed, like one of those weirdoes with tight pants; just makes 'em bleed  faster.&nbsp; You drive down a few more blocks,  and call out the next street name.&nbsp; The  man in the back heads up to the front.&nbsp;  You stop, and start giving the poor man a hand down the steps.&nbsp; Suddenly, without any warning at all, he  trips, and falls face first onto the concrete.&nbsp;  Finally, your bad luck has transported itself to someone else.&nbsp; You'd be ecstatic if it wasn't for the possum  the rolled away from his foot, spraying urine right into your somewhat gleeful  face.&nbsp; You blink twice, hoping you'll  wake up from your nap.&nbsp; No luck, you  watch as the man stands back up in the gaze of Aphrodite herself, and stroll  away with a straight spine and the biggest grin since the old guy you saw that  O.D.'d on Viagra in the back of your bus.&nbsp;  You friggin hate possums.</p>
        <p>Memories, and cell phones  in a sorrowful tune playing in a city by a countryside.&nbsp; Playing backwards and forwards, carrying  themselves to others through vibrations and electricity.&nbsp; Falling papers, and an invisible Rolex.&nbsp; Bad days, and mothers all cured by elevator  music; addicting in sound, annoying in stature.&nbsp;  Shit covered pebbles and urine coated possums, their problems compared  yours.&nbsp; Echoed steps foreshadowing trips  of love and loss.&nbsp; Frozen dew over trees  reaching out only to be ignored.&nbsp; Sucking  in the attention, a hurricane of time erasing wind.&nbsp; Papers of neglect, and an open window can  only cause more pain; in the form of sliced rubber under a metal frame of  money.&nbsp; A bus ride past half existing  basketball games, and all too real alleyways.&nbsp;  A sudden stop past a half eaten hot dog; enjoyed for a few seconds but  in the end neglected.&nbsp; Urine slicing  across more rubber, revenge served warm.&nbsp;  Dissension into a dream, followed by a drop kick of reality.&nbsp; Embarrassment manifested in a concrete  block.&nbsp; A spiral of eyes from onlookers,  and a smile in the swirl of suicidal indulgence.&nbsp; Urine on a face, a heart out of pace, and a  smile out of place.&nbsp; Possibilities of  love, and gossip twenty fold; destiny can go two ways.&nbsp; A bad day can end badder, but its so lovely  when it ends better.</p>
