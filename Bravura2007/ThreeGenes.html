        <h1>Three Generations in  Cuernevaca:
		 A Travel Memoir</h1>
<p>Kathy Stradley<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother  thought of it first.&nbsp; She was good at  plotting and scheming. She had long studied Spanish at adult night school, never  improving very much, but having a wonderful time trying to speak to as many  people as possible. She volunteered at the local hospital with her  friend Pat translating for patients, nurses and even doctors, although I&rsquo;m not sure  how accurate these translations were.&nbsp;  Even to my untrained ear, her accent was horrible. However, she had no fear of getting it wrong.&nbsp; She would get smiles and chuckles, but most people would grasp a little of what she  was getting at, and rephrase it for her in less crazy language.&nbsp; If she didn&rsquo;t know a word, she would make one up using her long remembered high school  Latin or she&rsquo;d use an English word with a Spanish ending.&nbsp; An extreme extrovert, she was never at a loss for words. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My daughter  Becky was getting fluent by now, having taken four years of Spanish in high school and some college  classes.&nbsp; Last summer she visited Costa    Rica with a group of students from her  junior college for a month of intensive language instruction, travel and  culture.&nbsp; She came back enraptured with the beautiful scenery and friendly people,  but not with the giant sized bugs inhabiting both rain forest and beaches.<br />
  &nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She loved  her grandma&rsquo;s idea at first hearing.&nbsp;  Another summer adventure and immersion experience was just what she needed  to break through to real fluency in Spanish.&nbsp; Since she planned to get a California teaching credential, fluent Spanish would be a great asset  in her career.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was less  adventurous than either my daughter or my mother, but as a first grade teacher struggling with a large Spanish speaking  population at my school, I too was attending Spanish classes for busy  teachers.&nbsp; These classes met once a week.&nbsp; They  were never intensive enough for me to progress beyond a certain basic level.&nbsp; I could usually follow a parent&rsquo;s  conversation enough to know the subject, but not what they were saying  about it.&nbsp; Verbs in their many forms were my downfall!&nbsp; Therefore, an immersion experience in Spanish appealed to me both as a travel  adventure and as a tax write off.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mom had originated  the idea, so she insisted on making the arrangements.&nbsp; Becky  had been impressed with her Costa    Rica experience. She wanted to go through her junior college as she had done  before.&nbsp;However, I needed upper division units to receive service  credit as a teacher. In the end we relinquished the making of arrangements to my  mother.&nbsp; She attended an orientation at her local state college and  signed us all up. Becky and I shared some slight  reservations with this plan.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t as if mom hadn&rsquo;t traveled all over Europe and the Middle East on prearranged tours, but sometimes planning the details  escaped her.&nbsp;In addition, she was somewhat na&iuml;ve in money matters, being  of a generation in which husbands handled all financial matters. In  the end we cast our reservations aside, and with great anticipation  filled out forms, checked passports, paid fees and packed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was only  able to attend the last pre trip meeting, which occurred on a Saturday.&nbsp; Here we met  our tour guide, academic advisor and fearless leader, Dr. Cuervo.&nbsp; With his  professorial glasses perched on the end of his brown nose, he looked rather like a Cuban Bill Cosby.&nbsp; Invariably social, he chatted about the wonderful program we had in store.&nbsp; As chairman of the Spanish Department, he assured us that he had been leading these  tours for over five years and that we were in good hands.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally,  with bags in tow, we boarded our Mexicana airlines flight from LAX,&nbsp; headed for Mexico City, and to our  ultimate destination, the garden city of Cuernevaca.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Straining  our eyes to find the sign for our group among the multitude of tour guides, relatives and friends meeting the flight, we  soon spotted our amiable professor with four bewildered students in tow.&nbsp; We joined the party hoisting our bags through the crush of people.&nbsp; As we waited for the professor to collect others, we chatted with our fellow  travelers.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A very  tall, athletic black woman was traveling with her son, who was ten years old.&nbsp; She  was married to a professional basketball player.&nbsp; She looked like she too could tear up a basketball court without  any trouble. A short, pretty, oriental girl about the age of my daughter  was also in a teacher training program.&nbsp;  She had the unusual nickname of Cricky.&nbsp;  She and Becky bonded instantly.&nbsp;  The last two members of the group were friends, but they were completely different in looks and  temperament.&nbsp; One had blond, Swedish good looks while the other was a tall, stout  brunette.&nbsp; Both were quite fluent in Spanish, loved the Mexican culture, and  had traveled extensively in Mexico already.&nbsp; We were glad to have some experienced travelers in our midst.&nbsp;  Our professor completed his roll call.&nbsp;  We were herded outside to the bus waiting to whisk us to our  destination.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bus  trip from Mexico City  took about an hour, but we were fascinated by the scenery rolling by, telling ourselves over  and over again that we were in the heart of Mexico.&nbsp; This was no Americanized border town. We wanted the real thing. We arrived in the beautiful city of  Cuernevaca,  playground for the wealthy, steeped in history and tradition.&nbsp; I fell in love with the beautiful old campus of our language school, a center of bilingual and  multicultural study, one of the most well established in the region.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We waited  in a large hall as the last of the travelers trickled in.&nbsp; All waited with anticipation and excitement for the Mexican  families to arrive and claim us as their own for the duration of our stay.&nbsp; We were lucky! Mom, at age 75, was the oldest of the group, so we were  housed with a family nearby, only a short walk from our school.&nbsp; We were lucky also, because, unlike some of the wealthy host families who  abdicated their role&nbsp;as mentors to hired help, our family took care of us  themselves; cooking dinner each night, spending time at the table after dinner  coaching us in          conversation, answering our questions and comparing  viewpoints on many issues.&nbsp; We learned so  much from them about life as a middle class family in Mexico.&nbsp; Much of what we learned no textbook could  ever teach us.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To add to  our pleasure, Isabel, the mother of the family, was a gourmet cook delighting us with <em>empanadas</em>, watermelon juice squeezed on her big home press, and wonderful concoctions of  vegetables and cactus pears.&nbsp;  Alberto, the father of the family, had cable television (a rarity in Mexico).&nbsp; He kept up with CNN, world events, and  news.&nbsp; He could talk knowledgeably about foreign relations with China, compare our social security system with Mexico&rsquo;s retirement system, and  discuss world trade matters.&nbsp;  We felt blessed to have been sent here!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The family  had two grown daughters; one married and living on a ranch some 30 miles away, another an artist who managed an  art studio in town.&nbsp; Their youngest,  a modern thinking young woman, had decided to forgo planning a fancy <em>Quinciniera</em> and instead take a trip to Europe with her older sister the following summer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The home of  Isabel and Alberto was a two-story gated Spanish style house with wrought iron bars on the windows and a yard  graced by anabundance of flowers and a few old trees.&nbsp; A welcoming&nbsp;  front patio withwrought iron bench provided a place to sit and contemplate  the garden.&nbsp; Theair had a soft, tropical feel and the exotic sounds of wild  parrots and other unknown species of birds filled the air.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At an  earlier time, Isabel&rsquo;s family had owned a much larger acreage,but they had gradually sold off plots of land to three  neighbors.&nbsp; During onestressful period, when the vagaries of a changing government  did notrecognize as legal the deed to their property, they were  required to rebuytheir home after having it completely paid off.&nbsp; Essentially, they had boughttheir house twice.&nbsp;Alberto, a retired postal worker  had a relatively good governmentpension, but with three children, one still in secondary  school,&nbsp; Isabel still used payments from the language school for housing their  students to help make ends meet.&nbsp; And  Isabel worked hard!&nbsp; She was up before us  each morning making watermelon juice in her juice press, firing  up the big stove and preparing savory dishes with the freshest fruits,  vegetables and chiles she could find.&nbsp; She  had a girl come in once a week to help with the heavy cleaning.&nbsp; She  attacked housecleaning with the fervor of a fanatic. Her standards were the highest.&nbsp;  Alberto, being retired, helped with the washing up after dinner and the heavy lifting, but Isabel insisted  on doing all of the cooking herself. We came to  be known as &ldquo;<em>Los Tres Generaciones</em>&rdquo;,  that is &ldquo;The Three Generations&rdquo;, by our family and others at the language  school.</p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday morning after our arrival we were  walking through cobblestoned streets lined with ancient buildings to our  venerable language school for placement testing.&nbsp; This hour long examination would determine  our level of Spanish proficiency and set our schedule of classes for the  duration of our stay.&nbsp; We were grouped by  levels. Becky scored &ldquo;advanced&rdquo;.&nbsp; My mom  was designated &ldquo;intermediate&rdquo; while I barely made &ldquo;beginning  intermediate&rdquo;.&nbsp; I was relieved to find  out I had gained &ldquo;intermediate&rdquo; status,<br />
  as the rank beginners attended classes at a satellite  campus.&nbsp; I would remain with my family in  the beautiful old buildings of the main campus.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our core  class was an intensive three hour language session with only six students to a  teacher.&nbsp; Here we would have many  opportunities to practice speaking with others at our level of ability.&nbsp; There were larger lecture classes on the  idioms and expressions common in Spanish.&nbsp;  We would have fun comparing English expressions like, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re pulling my  leg&rdquo; to the Spanish equivalent &ldquo;You&rsquo;re pulling my hair&rdquo;.&nbsp; Both indicate you are joking with me.&nbsp; Some of the literal translations were  hilarious to us.&nbsp; We <br />
spent many free moments first trying to use these  expressions in conversation, then laughing at the results. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After our  lecture class we would eat at the picnic tables on the patio where volunteers  from the community would converse with us about anything we found  interesting.&nbsp; This was a great  opportunity to ask questions, get advice and learn about the city of Cuernevaca.&nbsp; The only request was &ldquo;Spanish only,  please&rdquo;.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the  diehards there was one on one tutoring, which could be conducted anywhere they  wanted to go.&nbsp; The local bar, a  restaurant, shops or the downtown square, called the zocolo, all were places to  practice with a tutor. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the late  afternoons we could meet with other students at a &ldquo;<em>caf&eacute; social</em>&rdquo;, usually conducted at a local eatery, where we could  order coffee or a drink and converse some more.&nbsp;  The only rule in all of these locales was to speak only Spanish.&nbsp; That was sometimes hard among our three  generation family.&nbsp; Grandma was the  worst.&nbsp; She would easily lapse into  English when talking to Becky or me.&nbsp; The  point for her was always to say as much as possible.&nbsp; It was frustrating for her to have to say it  right.&nbsp; I had the opposite <br />
problem.&nbsp; I wanted to  say it perfectly or not at all.&nbsp; I would  always try to say something far too complicated for my language ability.&nbsp; I would not settle <br />
for the easy phrase.&nbsp;  We were always &ldquo;shushing&rdquo; each other when a faculty member came by after  we had inadvertently lapsed again into English.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The result  of all this conversation in Spanish was exhaustion every night from the effort  of dredging up the correct Spanish words to express ourselves.&nbsp; Exhaustion also resulted from the effort of  listening to others speaking Spanish and trying to piece together the meaning  of what they were saying.&nbsp; Now I could  understand why my Spanish speaking first graders got so tired struggling to  express themselves in English.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was  also Spanish homework each night after dinner until our tired brains shut down  and shouted &ldquo;enough!&rdquo; I slept each night like the dead, without movement or  interruption.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Becky was quickly immersed in the  younger crowd, most of them still in college or a few years into their first  job.&nbsp; Some were teachers while others  planned to become teachers.&nbsp; Most were  already fairly fluent including the two young men who became our substitute  tour directors when we discovered how flighty and disorganized our professor  could be.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first  young man, Raul, was short and intense.&nbsp;  He was half Mexican with small round glasses and the look and drive of a  Russian revolutionary.&nbsp; He was an  intellectual, identifying with the poor and the powerless.&nbsp; The second young man, Jeff, was a middle  school teacher with great compassion and wisdom in one so young.&nbsp; They both had an excellent command of  Spanish, knowledge of the culture and the savy of a native in getting around  the country.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We quickly  discovered that our professor had no sense of direction.&nbsp; He would ask for directions from any passerby  every few blocks as we trailed behind him.&nbsp;  He was prone to forgetting about us when he began socializing at a bar  or nightclub.&nbsp; Raul and Jeff helped us  out more than once, after we had been abandoned by our fearless leader.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crickey was  the sweet Oriental girl Becky had met at the airport and there were three or  four others who became Becky&rsquo;s constant companions.&nbsp; <br />
A young man who taught some of the advanced classes at the school  found the time to walk Becky home a few times.&nbsp;  With her dark eyes and flashing smile she could almost pass for a  native.&nbsp; I think he was a little smitten  with her, although she assured us that they were just friends.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my  small, intensive grammar and conversation class there were more people my  age.&nbsp; I recall a lawyer from west Texas who described  himself as a &ldquo;yeller dog&rdquo; democrat.&nbsp; When  we asked what that meant, he said he would vote the democratic ticket even if a  &ldquo;yeller dog&rdquo; was the candidate.&nbsp; We  discussed politics a lot with our young teacher, <em>Miguel Angel</em>, named for Michael the Archangel.  He was from the mountainous silver mining region of Taxco where Isabel of our host family had  grown up.&nbsp; We discussed the issue of  discrimination against the indigenous peoples of Mexico which still exists in many  regions today.&nbsp; We remarked on the  distrust of government and official news media we observed among the Mexican  people we came in contact with. We plied Miguel with questions about his experiences  as a child and as a citizen of Mexico  today. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was  another female teacher, in addition to myself, the Texas  lawyer and a young college student from Northern   California in our class.&nbsp; We  had many lively discussions with so many points of view, as Miguel goaded us  on, aiding our pronunciation along the way and helping us to rephrase our  garbled Spanish.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I walked  around during breaks I heard German and Swedish accents as well as British and  American English accents.&nbsp; It was truly  an international community!&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother  quickly developed a friendship with her intensive Spanish class teacher, Maria  Teresa.&nbsp; She was an attractive woman in  her forties with grown children.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m  sure Grandma kept her classmates laughing with her improbable, made up words  and her thick accent.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isabel  prided herself on her job as spiritual intercessor for the entire family.&nbsp; Her indigenous ancestry gave her a fierce  religiosity while the faith of her husband, Alberto, was lukewarm at best.&nbsp; Being Roman Catholic ourselves, we asked  about religious services we could attend.&nbsp;  Isabel assumed the task of guiding us.&nbsp;  She did not attend the local church.&nbsp;  Only the cathedral downtown with Mass presided over by the bishop would  do.&nbsp; She enlisted the aide of her oldest  daughter and her husband to drive us to the cathedral the following  Sunday.&nbsp; Since there was no parking  available nearby, her son-in-law had to slip the policeman a small bribe so we  could park in a no parking zone.&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isabel  insisted on arriving quite early so that we could occupy the first pew.&nbsp; It was as if the first pew in the cathedral  would guarantee us the first seat in God&rsquo;s heavenly kingdom.&nbsp; The bishop entered with pomp and ceremony as  we admired the beautiful old building.&nbsp;  We enjoyed the solemnity of the service while Isabel prayed  ferociously.&nbsp; At the communion she led us  up to the altar and back to our seats with possessive authority.<br />
          We appreciated her guidance although we would have felt much  more comfortable sitting in the back of the church, where we could observe the  whole scene rather than being the ones observed.&nbsp; When the bells had rung their last and the  bishop had departed we returned to our residence for an early Sunday dinner.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We  discovered how flighty our professor was on a weekend trip to Mexico City.&nbsp;  He collected money from all of us to obtain tickets to the Ballet  Folklorico, the most famous one, held at the opera house in the downtown  area.&nbsp; This is the story as we heard it  from Raul and Jeff, who heard it from the professor himself.&nbsp; Dr. Cuervo took a taxi to the city center to  purchase the tickets.&nbsp; His wallet slipped  out of his pocket as he sat in the back of the taxi chatting with the  driver.&nbsp; Upon arriving at the opera  house,<br />
          he stepped out of the cab, not realizing he had lost his wallet  until the cab pulled away from the curb.&nbsp;  It must have been a sight to see as he sprinted<br />
          down the street in hot pursuit of the taxi yelling &ldquo;Wait,  wait!&rdquo; at the top of his lungs.&nbsp; Luckily,  the cab driver spotted him from his side mirror and slowed down.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The good  professor, having a worse sense of direction than my mom, had difficulty  finding our hotel.&nbsp; His method was to  stop someone on every<br />
          corner to ask the way.&nbsp;  Raul and Jeff tried to assist in the search.&nbsp; It was only through their intervention that  we ever found it.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After  having been deposited at the hotel, we had a few hours to relax before we met  in the lobby for a walking tour of downtown, the giant <em>Zocolo</em> <br />
          (Main Square)  and the National Cathedral.&nbsp; On our tour  we were struck by the contrast of beauty and ugliness we saw around us.&nbsp; Beautiful old buildings were juxtaposed with  trash strewn empty lots.&nbsp; People in  formal dress exiting fancy cars contrasted with beggars lying on the  street.&nbsp; The Mexico City <em>Zocolo</em> was the largest we had ever seen.&nbsp; Modern buildings rimmed the wrought iron  railed flower beds.&nbsp; The ancient  cathedral loomed ahead of us, sheathed in scaffolding to buttress its bulk  against further <br />
          earthquake damage.&nbsp;  The inevitable smell of incense filled the air as Aztec dancers performed  colorful dances in elaborate headdresses, acorn rattles adorning their ankles.  We ended our tour at a small restaurant, where our professor ordered a few  beers, greeted an acquaintance, and promptly forgot <br />
          our existence.&nbsp; He  soon left the restaurant deep in conversation with this new companion while the  rest of us were left to get home the best way we could.<br />
          Again, Raul and Jeff came to our rescue leading us back to  our hotel.&nbsp; We ended up sharing a small  volkswagon type of taxi.&nbsp; All of us piled  two deep into the back seat.&nbsp; We arrived  rumpled but relieved at our destination.<br />
          Mom demanded that we retire early, since a trip to the Aztec  ruins at <em>Tenochtitland</em> was on the  agenda for the next day.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had a  beautiful day in <em>Tenochtitland</em> climbing the steps of the Temple  of the Sun for an eagle&rsquo;s eye view of the entire valley.<br />
          I worried about my mother climbing these narrow rock steps,  because she<br />
          had recently had cataract surgery.&nbsp; She had been warned by her doctor to take  precautions against falling.&nbsp; I kept  behind her like a rear guard of <br />
          the quarterback in a football game.&nbsp; Becky stayed beside her.&nbsp; She was determined to go to the midpoint,  then motioned us to do the rest without her.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t  fear of falling, but lack of breath that forced her to quit.&nbsp; If not for that, she would have gone the  distance.&nbsp; Her twice weekly aerobic  classes had given her a lot of stamina, but a history of smoking had taken a  toll on her lungs.&nbsp; As it was, she  received words of admiration and encouragement from our companions because she  did so well for her age.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night  we watched the beautiful dances from different regions of Mexico at the  Ballet Folklorico.&nbsp; The opera house was  filled with marble and gilded ornaments.&nbsp;  Sculptures lined the impressive foyer. It was an elegant evening.&nbsp; We found our own taxi that night following  the performance. Against all advice we rode in an &ldquo;unregistered&rdquo; cab, a  dangerous thing to do!&nbsp; This cab was of  the volkswagon variety.&nbsp; The door on the  passenger side had been removed and the front passenger seat taken out.&nbsp; Mom and Becky sat in the back while I  crouched in the front, where a seat had once been, giving directions to the  driver.&nbsp; We gave him the address of the  hotel and a few landmarks close by, but he was unable to find the right  street.&nbsp; I knew we were close because I  recognized familiar buildings.&nbsp; After  driving around another 10 minutes, I finally demanded that he stop and let us  out right there.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think he was  trying to jack up the fare, he was just lost.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We walked  for a few blocks and then a few more until we finally<br />
          recognized the hotel street.&nbsp;  Walking on Mexican streets is more hazardous<br />
          than walking in the U.S.A. because the pavement is so  often uneven.&nbsp; There are loose paving  stones, holes in the streets and barriers which would never be allowed  here.&nbsp; On this evening walk to our hotel  we almost lost Grandma.<br />
          She tripped and started to fall as Becky and I grabbed her  on both sides.&nbsp; We broke her fall but  could not save her glasses.&nbsp; They fell to  the sidewalk.<br />
          Luckily, the lenses were ok but one arm of the frames broke  off.&nbsp; The glasses were easily fixed, but  the psychological damage lasted longer.&nbsp;  She had been so fearless until now, but this partial fall started her  worrying about a detached retina or worse.&nbsp;  For the rest of the weekend she stayed in the hotel, only venturing out  with us once to get her glasses repaired. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During our  last week in Cuernevaca, we were visited by Isabel&rsquo;s older sister and her only  son.&nbsp; They lived on a large ranch in the  foothills of the mountains where silver is still mined today.&nbsp; Her son was 20 years old.&nbsp; <br />
          He was doted on by his mother and two aunts as the only boy  child and inheritor of a large and prosperous estate.&nbsp; It soon became clear that he was interested  in impressing Becky with his position and his prospects.&nbsp; As we shared dinner that night, both mother  and aunt kept the conversation focused on him.&nbsp;  A bit of bragging ensued as they extolled the richness of their land,  the number of cattle and other signs of favor bestowed by fate on this young  man.&nbsp; Alberto, although he didn&rsquo;t  contribute to this conspiracy of adulation, seemed slightly amused by it  all.&nbsp; <br />
          When the conversation came around  to Becky, she, in turn, mentioned her own plans and prospects.&nbsp; Always an ambitious child, she had alternated  between plans to become a doctor or a teacher. Her thoughts were far away from  courtship.&nbsp; She had had the occasional  boyfriend, but none of them had enough influence to alter her plans for her own  brilliant future. For her part, she was oblivious to the manipulations going on  in this conversation.<br />
          I could see the traditional  matchmaking scheme of mother and aunt at work, but for a modern young woman  from California  there was a culture gap a mile wide.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our three  week stay was over far too soon.&nbsp; We were  &ldquo;short timers&rdquo;.<br />
          Others in our group had extended their stay to four  weeks.&nbsp; A generous patron of the language  school offered her home as the site for our farewell celebration.&nbsp; We were allowed to invite our host families  to attend with us.&nbsp; Isabel, her youngest  daughter, her sister and the favored nephew accepted the invitation.&nbsp; There was a short formal presentation of  certificates of completion, a thank you to the host families, and gifts from  the participants to their host families.&nbsp;  After the formal ceremonies, we had food, a sing- along and  dancing.&nbsp; When all of the cameras came  out the inevitable group pictures were taken.&nbsp;  We exchanged addresses and phone numbers so we could keep in touch with  all of our newfound friends.&nbsp; Dr. Cuervo  was in his element; chatting, dancing, joking and charming our hosts.&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grandma had  shopped carefully for her teacher, presenting her proudly with a beautiful  hand-woven lace tablecloth. We had taken our Mexican family out the night  before for a farewell and thank you dinner, and now we presented them with a  matching set of plush towels for their solicitude in coaching us and attending  to our needs.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were a  little jealous of those staying on, but also eager to get home to our men folk.&nbsp; Becky and Crickie had their heads together  already planning a reunion of the younger set.&nbsp;  I thought with nostalgia about all the things I had learned on this trip  in addition to the Spanish language.&nbsp; The  language was really only a part of our communication with this other  culture.&nbsp; What we took home with us was a  view from a different window than our own onto the world.&nbsp; We had questioned, from a different  perspective, our notions of the way this world worked and our place in it.<br />
          I couldn&rsquo;t help but think how wonderful it would be to look  from many windows, or many cultures at our world.&nbsp; Language and travel were just tools to expand  our vision.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we were  leaving by bus the next morning, we watched the city of Cuernevaca disappear in the distance to be  replaced by a rural landscape.<br />
          Finally we beheld the cement monuments and teeming masses of  humanity in Mexico City.&nbsp; As our plane strained to power the steep  assent into the clouds and clear the high mountains surrounding Mexico City, we said  goodbye in our hearts to a graceful and generous land.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today,  twelve years later, I reminisce about our trip as I browse through an old  picture album.&nbsp; My mother passed away two  years ago after battling breast cancer and a series of mini strokes which left  her without language for the last few months of her life.&nbsp; And yet, until that last year she had  faithfully attended her aerobic classes, volunteered at her church and  communicated by e-mail with relatives all over the country.&nbsp; Her life continues to be an inspiration for  me.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Becky never  lost her taste for travel.&nbsp; She spent her  junior year of college in Spain  and also visited friends in Germany  and the UK.&nbsp; She decided to teach school in England three years ago, to be near the new man  in her life, a British engineer living in London,  whom she met through a mutual friend.&nbsp;  They married last January at an old world Catholic church in the Little  Italy section of San Diego.&nbsp; We housed seventeen relatives and friends  from England  over Christmas and into January.&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am happy  for her and I like my son-in-law and his family very much.&nbsp; However, I am a little sad that she settled  so far away from home.&nbsp; They <br />
          assure me they will someday relocate here.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll see.&nbsp;  Anyway, I have a great excuse to visit England!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I retired  from teaching school last June.&nbsp; I am now  in the process of reviving old hobbies, returning to college, and planning  trips.&nbsp; I am currently planning to visit Israel, the Holy Land  of the Bible.&nbsp; We visited Becky and her  husband, Stephen, in London  twice and hope to go again next Easter.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We lost  touch with our Mexican family long ago, but I will never forget their  hospitality and friendship. For all those who study Spanish in Mexico, I wish  for them an experience and a family as wonderful as ours!</p>
