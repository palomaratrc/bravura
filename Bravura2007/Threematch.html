        <h1><strong>Three on a Match </strong></h1><br />
          Joe Djordjevski </p>
        <p>Darkness prevails as the last hint of sunlight sinks  below the surface of the black horizon. It is a barren battlefield covered in  trenches, shell holes and tangles of barbed wire. It is a No Man&rsquo;s Land. A  flare is shot into the sky, illuminating the earth below with a radiant red  haze. A lone soldier crouches in a small, shallow shell hole. The hole is cold,  wet and muddy and he is covered from helmet to boot in mud. Only the white of  his eyes is visible through the layer of caked mud on his long, unshaved face.  A cold breeze sweeps through his shelter, causing his already shaken body to  shiver even more. He embraces his parka with all his might. This damn, blasted  wind is a bloody menace! he says to himself. It has been attacking him all  night and he is sick of it. He has been at battle for four days straight now,  not a day&rsquo;s rest. His empty stomach feels like it is slowly burning from the  inside out. His dry throat feels like cotton as he painfully swallows. Yes, he  needs food, he needs water, but they can wait. There is but one thing that he  craves above all else. A cigarette. <br />
          He reaches into his tunic and pulls  out a wrinkly old cigarette, his last one, his only one; the one cigarette that  he has kept without smoking for days now. It has been four days of constant  battle. Four days of muddy trenches. Four days of machine guns. Four days of  death.&nbsp; He can put off smoking no longer.  Just one cigarette, that&rsquo;s all he needs to get through this hellish night. He  puts the cigarette to his lips. He immediately tastes the harsh sweetness of  the tobacco. He stands up and reaches into his pocket for a match. He pokes  around inside the pocket; digging through small chunks of mud. But finds  nothing. The book of matches he kept inside it is missing. The pocket must have  been left opened, he thinks to himself. The pocket is empty, empty like his  lungs that long for their grayish remedy. <br />
          He reaches around frantically,  checking every crevice in his vomit-colored outfit, his heart beating faster  and faster every time he finds nothing. Then his heart sinks, he gives up; he  is matchless. He has a cigarette, but no match, nothing to ignite the cure to  his craving. As he contemplates his hellish situation, the blood red flares  that illuminate the black skies pause. Everything darkens. The crescent moon  gives but a taste of its full potential to light up the night sky. It is too  dark to see more than a couple feet in front of himself. It is because of this  darkness that he decides to pursue his goal elsewhere. <br />
          Just a few yards across the barren  wasteland of black mud the enemy sits and waits with his guns ready. But as  long as it is dark the night will be his shield from enemy sights. As long as  he is quick and quiet, he can leave his shelter for a short time and get a  match. He looks to his left; no more than thirty steps away some of his  comrades take shelter. He remembers them from earlier in the night when they  first took their positions. There were two of them, surely at least one of them  will have a match, he thinks to himself. He takes a deep breath. He briefly  contemplates the risk he is taking. If he is caught in the open it will surely  be his demise. But he cannot bear the craving. His tender gums water when he  imagines the smoke taking over his mouth. He will be left incomplete and  unfulfilled if he does not smoke. He will not settle for defeat this night. It  is enough for him to take this risk, and he does. <br />
          He crouches down as he runs toward  his comrades&rsquo; shelter. His boots make a loud sucking sound as he trudges  through the thick mud. He slows down as he nears their position. After quickly  catching his breath he calls out to the two dark figures in the crater in front  of him<br />
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey mates, it&rsquo;s me!&rdquo; <br />
  &ldquo;Thomason, is that you?&rdquo; A loud  whisper replies.<br />
  &nbsp;&ldquo;It is.&rdquo;<br />
  &ldquo;Get in here, b&rsquo;fore a shell  catches you wide open!&rdquo; <br />
          He climbs into their shelter and crouches down next to them,  breathing heavily. He can barely make out the shapes of their bodies through  the darkness. The one to the left is short and round. The soldier to the right,  tall and thin. Their shelter is much larger than his. It is equipped with rows  of sandbags and damp, rotting wood on the edges of the opening. The bottom of  the hole is covered in black, muddy water deep enough to drown a man&rsquo;s entire  foot. <br />
  &ldquo;Are you mad, Thomason?&rdquo; the short  one asks him in a high-pitched voice. &ldquo;You might&rsquo;ve been picked off if one of  us didn&rsquo;t know better and mistook you for a Jerry!&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&ldquo;I need a flame&rdquo; he replies.<br />
  &ldquo;A flame?&rdquo; <br />
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got me a fag but I haven&rsquo;t a  match, I must&rsquo;ve lost them somewhere in No Man&rsquo;s Land.&rdquo; <br />
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re willing to meet face to  face with a Hun&rsquo;s shell for a bloody fag?&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Believe me, I&rsquo;d die for a smoke right now.&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&ldquo;Well it seems fortune is in your favor my  friend&rdquo; the deep voice from the tall one replies. &ldquo;You came at the right time.  We got one match between the two of us, and we was just about to use it.&rdquo; As  the man pulls out the match they uncomfortably crouch, shivering in the cold,  damp mud. <br />
  &ldquo;Stand up, it&rsquo;s all right. Jerry&rsquo;s sleeping  tonight, plus, a night as dark as this you can&rsquo;t even see your own Johnny when  you&rsquo;re pissing&rdquo; the short one says to the others.<br />
          They stand up. A gust of icy wind briefly slithers through  their muddy haven, brushing against their pale, unprotected faces. The tall  soldier waits for the wind to pass, and then strikes the match against his  helmet. The spark ignites in a bright explosion of orange, yellow glow. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
          Across the sea of darkness,  adjacent to the three soldiers, a sniper sees a quick flash of light in the  distance. With his gray eyes peering through the scope on his long rifle, he  immediately sets his sights on it. He has been lying on his stomach in the same  position for a long time, for what seems like forever. He had not seen a single  movement across the field all night, nothing to attract his attention. He had  almost gone mad with boredom. But now, he finally has some action. The cold air  pierces through the thick gray trench coat that covers his long body, yet he  does not shiver. He remains still. He can feel the cold in his bones; he can  feel it in his soul, yet all his attention is now on his newly spotted target:  a tiny light in the distance. At first he wonders what it could be, but soon  realizes that it is a match, most likely igniting a man&rsquo;s cigarette. If he  fires at the light, he will also be firing at a man&rsquo;s face. He feels a sense of  relief knowing he gets to kill a man for once without seeing his eyes before he  kills him. It is much harder to pull the trigger then, but in the darkness,  with nothing but the flame of a match, pulling the trigger is like flipping a  switch, he will turn it off and move on, no remorse. He remains focused on the  match as it flickers when making contact with the cigarette it ignites. It then  suddenly moves to the right, temporarily growing smaller as it moves to the  next man. His rifle follows the flame. Now, he puts his finger on the trigger.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
          Leaning against a stack of  sandbags, the short, round soldier carefully takes the match from the tall  shadow to the right of him. The flame diverges between the match and his long  white cigarette as he breathes in. He makes a wheezy noise as he sucks the  smoke into his lungs. He exhales a big cloud of smoke and pauses before handing  the match to his left. <br />
  &ldquo;Thomason. What if we were to share  this fag? That&rsquo;s your last one and I&rsquo;m just about out as well. If we share we  can have one for later.&rdquo;<br />
          Thomason nods with disapproval. He  had waited too long and gone through too much to share a cigarette. He wants  one all to himself. He reaches out his hand, motioning for him to hand over the  match.<br />
  &ldquo;Sorry lad, half a fag just won&rsquo;t  cut it.&rdquo; <br />
  &ldquo;As you wish,&rdquo; he replies.</p>
        <p>The sniper&rsquo;s finger rests on the  trigger as he peers through his scope at the flickering target. He wants to be  sure to fire straight at the man&rsquo;s forehead, so he focuses on the blackness a  couple of inches above the twinkling flame. He is ready to fire. Then the flame  suddenly moves once again to the right, leaving his target nothing more than an  empty black, fading away in the rest of the surrounding darkness.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  &ldquo;Here ya go Thomason, be careful,  the flame grows small.&rdquo; The short shadow slowly hands him the match. He pulls  it toward himself, the flame delaying as if it fights to stay in its former  position. His heart is filled with relief as his lips tightly grip the  cigarette. He takes a second to glance at the flame in front of him. He finally  gets to smoke. He finally gets fulfillment. He wants to take time to soak in  the relief he feels, he wants it to last, so he hesitates.</p>
        <p>The sniper&rsquo;s finger tightens around  the trigger. He will not take another chance. He must fire. He must fire now!  He blocks off his breath as it tries frantically to escape his lips. He hears  the loud, pumping of blood through his every artery, causing his eardrums to  pulsate in sync with his pounding heart. He slowly begins to push on the cold,  metal trigger as he focuses intently on the flickering flame. </p>
        <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better hurry up with that,  Thomason!&rdquo; one of the soldiers tells him as he sucks on the warm tobacco filled  paper. He slowly brings the match to his cigarette. As the flame nears the tip,  a violent wind charges through the small shelter like a wave sweeping through  the tides on the surface of a black ocean, as strong and cold as all the others  before it combined, roaring as it passes. It causes the soldiers to tuck their  heads under the collars of their parkas. The frail flame of the match flickers,  once, twice and it goes out, leaving nothing but a small, bare wooden stick  with smoke slowly rising from its tip. </p>
        <p>The sniper&rsquo;s target suddenly  vanishes, leaving him with nothing more than a single wall of blackness in  front of his eyes. His finger begins to shake as it slowly loosens from its  tight grip. His target has vanished. He takes his eyes away from the scope and  peers toward the position of the once existing flame in the distance. His eyes  pick up nothing but black. He frantically looks through his scope again and  again, expecting the flame to return once more. But it does not. He has missed  his opportunity and his target has gotten away from him.</p>
        <p>Thomason stands frozen in disbelief  as he fixes his eyes upon a mere stick, with nothing but a black tip blending  in with the darkness of the night. His moonlit eyes open wide with shock as the  unlit cigarette dangles from his lips. He returns to the feeling of defeat he  felt earlier when he realized he was matchless. Now he has a match, but no  flame. <br />
  &ldquo;I must be cursed. I am a cursed  man!&rdquo; He shouts out to the others. </p>
        <p>The sniper sits up. He lets out a  deep breath, creating a smoke-like cloud of cold air in front of his rough  face. He rubs his icy hands together; he now acknowledges the cold he is  embedded in. His body still slightly trembles from the adrenaline he felt  earlier. He briefly contemplates what happened. He knows it was his fault for  missing this opportunity. He took too long. He should have fired sooner. That&rsquo;s  one lucky Tommy he thinks to himself as he gets back into position and  continues to peer through the scope at the darkness in front of him. Back to  the boredom. Back to the cold; where he will patiently wait for another small  flash of light in the distance. </p>
