        <h1><strong>The Tree House</strong></h1><br />
Tiffany Hauswirth
<p>It  wasn't a big deal. &nbsp;I don't know why he thought George should be buried  instead of flushed. &nbsp;He was just a fish.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found him floating at the top of the  bowl. &nbsp;I was carefully carrying the glass grave down the hall, but he saw  me. &nbsp;His eyes were half open, and from where I was standing they looked  red. &nbsp;But they usually were.&nbsp;  &quot;What . . . are you doing?&quot; he said. &nbsp;<br />
          I  told him, &quot;My fish just died.&quot;<br />
          He  wobbled off the couch and tripped over the coffee table and a forgotten bowl of  cereal. &nbsp;I knew that was going to happen. &nbsp;He groaned as he crawled  to his feet. &nbsp;His thinning hair flopped over his eyes. &nbsp;He pushed it  away, then scratched his crusty face.<br />
          I  set George on the coffee table so I could clean up the mess. &nbsp;The kitchen  rag was dirty. &nbsp;I'd have to do some laundry later.<br />
          He  called me out to the garage, &quot;Come here and grab a shovel.&quot; &nbsp;I  scooped up George and started over until he said, &quot;Oh forget it. &nbsp;I  will.&nbsp; You can meet me outside.&quot;<br />
          I  shook my head. &nbsp;Why did he care? &nbsp;I knew George didn't care. &nbsp;I  definitely didn't care.<br />
          I  cared when he took me to the County Fair when mom left five years ago.  &nbsp;George came back with us after the ring-toss booth.<br />
          He  was fine the first year. &nbsp;He ate his food. &nbsp;He came to me when I wanted  him to. &nbsp;Then he stopped responding, or even looking at me.<br />
          Eventually  it got to the point where I had to beg him to eat, until he just refused.<br />
          Then  George died.<br />
          I  was sitting under the oak tree when he swished open the screechy screen door.  &nbsp;He flopped down the steps with the shovel in his hand.<br />
          The  noise startled a bird, so I looked up to see it fly away.<br />
          The  sky was so blue. &nbsp;The way it faded around the edges made it look round  like a bowl. &nbsp;An upside-down bowl. &nbsp;And we got dumped out.<br />
          As  soon as he reached the tree he started digging. &nbsp; He was awkward at first.  &nbsp;His face strained, almost in pain. &nbsp;The strokes became steadier and  smoother, and his face relaxed but it was still firm and determined.<br />
          His  arms pulsed with every crunch and whoosh. &nbsp;There was a muscle or a nerve,  one of the two, that made his cheek twitch a little on every upstroke.  &nbsp;I'm not sure how big he thought George was, but the hole was getting to  be big enough that he could fit inside it.<br />
          He  couldn't fit in the tree house. &nbsp;He built it the summer I turned seven.  &nbsp;I wanted it in the oak tree.<br />
          We  went to the hardware store to get the wood and nails to build it.<br />
          We worked  on it all day. &nbsp;Mom brought us lemonade after it was finished. &nbsp;We  were gonna drink it inside, but he couldn't fit. &nbsp;We laughed.&nbsp; But that was a long time ago.<br />
          The  shovel was still moving steadily but his face was softer, like it was melting.<br />
          He  walked over to the tree and set the shovel down beside it. &nbsp;He stared at  the hole, then glanced in my direction.<br />
          I  got up from where I was sitting. &nbsp;I climbed into the giant hole and placed  George at the bottom. &nbsp;He helped me get out.<br />
          My  dad and I filled up the hole together.</p>
