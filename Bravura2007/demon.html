        <h1>Demon  in the Hole</h1>
        <p><br />
        By  Jack Mawhinney</p>
        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andy  stood on the derrick platform relaxing until the next ninety feet stand of  drill pipe was to be added to the six thousand feet already in the hole.&nbsp; . Activity had slowed down, giving him an  opportunity to marvel at his ability to handle the job racking drill pipe  stands. It occurred to him how far he had come in just eight weeks, &ldquo;A new hire  and I showed them I could rack ninety-foot drill pipe as fast as any roughneck  whether the derrick floor was dry as a bone or slick as a used car salesman. It  was my idea to make a mat out of two-by-fours to keep the muddy floor dry for  the crew. No other of the roughnecks thought to do as much.&rdquo; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  evening shift had earlier relieved the daytime tower and settled in, satisfied  that a fresh drill would make the next eight hours an easy shift. The floor  boss, Whitey Almond, an ex-union negotiator, periodic alcoholic and radical Socialist,  helped Andy to make the usual clean-up of the rig, securing loose drill pipe,  hosing off the muddy deck, and putting away 36 inch wrenches and various hand  tools scattered across the oil derrick floor. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeff  &ldquo;Sledge&rdquo; Mackie, the derrick man and a payday drinker whose idea of  entertainment was to start brawls in the nearest bar; a cheerful man of great  humor and a hard worker. He is re-hired on a regular basis. Andy admired  &ldquo;Sledge&rsquo;s&rdquo; lack of fear of heights ninety feet up in the derrick and his  willingness to come down on a regular basis to monitor the viscosity of the  drilling mud.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  driller, Hank Jackson, took his place at the control board off to the side of  the floor, adjusting the speed as the drill cut through each new formation. His  touch sensed every reaction of the rotary drill. The man was a pro. Thirty one  years of experience had made him well respected. &nbsp;Andy was especially impressed by him. He often  thought, &ldquo;Hank Jackson was a man of fairness and sure judgment&rdquo;.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As  Andy came in sight dawdling across the derrick floor, Hank Jackson turned  crimson and hollered over the noise of the diesel engines, &ldquo;Junior, get your  ass over to the mud pits and give &ldquo;Sledge&rdquo; a hand before you wind up riding a  drill pipe over downtown Santa Barbara.&rdquo;  Embarrassment gripped the nineteen year old Andy, mumbling under his breath,  &ldquo;Jeez, nobody told me that I was supposed to work the mud pit. I&rsquo;m not Junior!!&rdquo;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At  the dinner break Andy asked Whitey, &ldquo;Why did the boss get so hot with me  earlier? I completed all the work I was supposed to&rdquo;. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re  as green as they come, Kid. The first rule is you don&rsquo;t ever take it easy when  another roughneck is working his butt off&rdquo;. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Okay,  but I don&rsquo;t like being called Junior&rdquo;<br />
          Whitey looked at  the kid with a measure of contempt and said, &ldquo;Grow up and they won&rsquo;t call you  Junior. He got up and then turned back,&rdquo;Kid, drilling for oil is one thing, but  drilling for natural gas is as dangerous as it comes. It will surface at  incredible speed if the viscosity isn&rsquo;t maintained. An explosion within five  hundred feet of the rig will incinerate all of us.&rdquo; <br />
          After dinner the  men went back to their stations. Jackson  pulled a plug of chewing tobacco from his shirt, a sure sign that he was  pleased about the drilling pace they were making. They had put down two ninety  foot stands of drill pipe in just four hours. It looked like two more stands  would be in by midnight.  Everything was spinnin like the button on a outhouse door. <br />
          Within forty  minutes of putting the third stand in the hole the ground began to shake, first  with a smooth rocking pace, followed by mounting vibration.<br />
          A threatening grumble came up from  deep down. The framework of the derrick &nbsp;rattled and swayed, cable snapped like a whip,  and equipment crashed against the steel legs. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  cry of danger was shouted from one crew member to the next, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s loose!  She&rsquo;ll blow!&rdquo;<br />
  &ldquo;Sledge&rdquo; slid down  cable from his seventy foot perch, cutting his hands into a bloody pattern. Jackson jumped to the  ground and ran in huge strides to get away from the drill site.<br />
          Whitey yelled  above the din to his green roughneck, &ldquo;Into the basement! We&rsquo;ve got to close  off the damn Demon.&rdquo;<br />
          Both jumped off the drilling  platform and dropped into the basement which&nbsp;  housed &nbsp;two massive shut-off gates  designed for emergencies.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  concrete walls were popping and creaking. The extra drill pipe, now free from  its restraint, drunkenly staggered against the ribs and braces of the steel  pyramid. Small hand-tools rained down from high up in the triangular structure  drumming on the derrick floor. The ground and the basement groaned. The  rumbling threat of the gas accompanied by a strong sulfuric smell seeped into  the basement choking the man and boy. Andy gasped from the bite of the acrid  chemistry. He looked at Whitey with a silent appeal to run. <br />
          Their sweat darkened their shirts.  Fear glistened in their eyes.<br />
          Whitey strained  against the stopcocks. &nbsp;&ldquo;Shut that valve  kid! &nbsp;Pull kid, pull.&rdquo; <br />
          Andy hollered over the chaos, &ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t get it shut.&rdquo; <br />
  &nbsp;&ldquo;My valve is freeing up, kid. One more jerk  and we&rsquo;re out of here.&rdquo;<br />
          The second gate came free. Once  loose, the emergency controls smoothly throttled the Demon, the drill pipe  locked in place, and six thousand feet of drill pipe calmed down, <br />
          Out into the light  again Andy, hands trembling, looked back to see the pride in Whitey&rsquo;s steel-gray  eyes. From that time on no one of the crew called Andy by the name of Junior.
