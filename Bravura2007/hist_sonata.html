        <h1><strong>a brief history of sonata form</strong></h1><br />
          mat rakers
        <p>1. exposition</p>
        <p>despite my family&rsquo;s  ceaseless efforts<br />
          weeds killed our  lawn again that year<br />
          while my brother  and i massacred ants<br />
          danny with his  magnifying glass,<br />
          me with my hose<br />
          in a book I came  across,<br />
          i found that ants  can bear fifty times their weight<br />
          like bulldozers and  buildings and dicks,<br />
          in another book I  came across,<br />
          everyone went  blind, <br />
          and only one human  retained her sight.<br />
          she was raped.</p>
        <p>we&rsquo;d hide behind  our grapevine,<br />
          crouching down  between green and<br />
          black watermelon  shells<br />
          I&rsquo;d throw from my  kitchen window.<br />
          spying out between  the leaves,<br />
          between the heat  created energy fields<br />
          seeping from  everything in sight,<br />
          there was a haze,<br />
          a queer steam,<br />
          and when I looked  really hard,<br />
          I could see boils  on the neighborhood,<br />
          and the sun left  spots in my eyes so<br />
          when I looked at my  hand<br />
          there were boils  there too.</p>
        <p>lines of solitary  pine trees protected my<br />
          house, an honor  guard.<br />
          they saluted the  sun like russian soldiers <br />
          in those old black  and white flims.<br />
          these real trees  smell much better <br />
          than car  fresheners.<br />
          I skipped soccer  practice and had sex in<br />
          the mulch those  trees rose out of,<br />
          with a girl in a  uniform after school,<br />
          she was the first,<br />
          and I got black  eyes like rocky<br />
          after getting hit  in the back of my head<br />
          with a bat,<br />
          then in the front  of my head with fists,<br />
          for fucking the  wrong girl.<br />
          I tell my parents I  was hit by a stray <br />
          lacrosse ball,<br />
          and I&rsquo;m glad my  hair covered the blood,<br />
          like teen people or  time or cosmo.</p>
        <p>I enjoyed these  things because that year<br />
          I read a book,<br />
          about a samurai who  killed hundreds of <br />
          people with two  swords,<br />
          while declaring  himself one with the universe.<br />
          I always hated gi  joe.</p>
        <p>the neighbor boy  grew to thirteen that <br />
          year,<br />
          and killed three  baby ducks with rocks,<br />
          they were caught in  the algae,<br />
          because the water  didn&rsquo;t circulate,<br />
          and there was no  wind.<br />
          I saw him in church  a day later,<br />
          in between people  singing praises,<br />
          and understood the  words family and support,<br />
          so I learned big  words like hedonism<br />
          and nihilism and  hypocrisy and read the<br />
          anti christ<br />
          and scratched  anarchy on the tops of desks.</p>
        <p>we threw  firecrackers in the sewers,<br />
          and weren&rsquo;t  surprised when george shot <br />
          himself in the  head,<br />
          or when the janitor  found a body<br />
          hanging from the  rafters of our high<br />
          school<br />
          because he liked a  girl.<br />
          (she didn&rsquo;t like  him back)<br />
          the intellectuals  laughed and called it <br />
          melodramatic  between ap classes,<br />
          and said things  like juxtaposition and <br />
          paradoxical<br />
          and were mad when I  called them redundant,<br />
          and I smiled when  jocks stole their <br />
          virgin girlfriends,  and gave them back<br />
          damaged.</p>
        <p>that year I heard  that technology <br />
          advances faster  than man&rsquo;s ability to <br />
          handle it.<br />
          our teacher was  talking about cloning<br />
          and atom bombs,<br />
          but it&rsquo;s the same  with pretty girls and <br />
          their tits.<br />
          they end up getting  fucked by guys and<br />
          guys and guys and  the occasional girl<br />
          and the drinks make  their sweat smell <br />
          like formaldehyde<br />
          which makes me  think of 7th grade life <br />
          science,<br />
          of dissecting frogs  on tables<br />
          and dangling their  intestines in front of <br />
          the pretty girl in  the lab, the one I&rsquo;ve had<br />
          a crush on for  years.<br />
          and I wonder if the  frizzy girl with the<br />
          bug glasses feels  left out.<br />
          I wonder if she  wishes someone would <br />
          dangle their  intestines in front of her.</p>
        <p>my friends decide  that ugly people <br />
          aren&rsquo;t worth  knowing<br />
          and I&rsquo;m confused,<br />
          but they say that  ugly people don&rsquo;t <br />
          develop like  attractive people,<br />
          because of new big  words like <br />
          behavioralism and  I&rsquo;m pretty sure this<br />
          means we&rsquo;re  play-doh,<br />
          and I ask if that  makes them retarded,<br />
          and if ugly means  hermit,<br />
          and if hermits are  people too,<br />
          because humans are  social creatures,<br />
          and the very idea  of no connections <br />
          means hermits  aren&rsquo;t people, right?<br />
          and they laugh and  call me an asshole.</p>
        <p>hummers became  popular that year,<br />
          the car and the  act.<br />
          I asked for one and  received the national <br />
          anthem.<br />
          the school heard  about this, because the<br />
          current pretty girl  was notorious<br />
          and I felt oddly  patriotic and heartened <br />
          during the pledge  of allegiance,<br />
          but I hid my head  when she walked by<br />
          between periods one  and two,<br />
          while cell phones  began to eat my <br />
          friends,<br />
          so they never  needed to branch out,<br />
          and I envied their  excuse.</p>
        <p>my mom tells me  about deserters from <br />
          world war two,<br />
          and talks about how  they hid in the <br />
          jungles of the  philippines<br />
          and still live  there now<br />
          because they don&rsquo;t  know it&rsquo;s over.<br />
          my skin goes cold,<br />
          my hair stands like  plasma rays.</p>
        <p>the people around  me, <br />
          i don&rsquo;t know.<br />
          the voice inside my  head calls me a <br />
          social retard,<br />
          and recommends  cocaine,<br />
          adding that if I&rsquo;m  going to fuck with<br />
          myself, I should go  all out<br />
          and not waste my  time with semantics <br />
          like pot.<br />
          I thank it  profusely.</p>
        <p>the cyclogenesis  spasms at times,<br />
          and I wonder if  this dimension is <br />
          collapsing on  itself,<br />
          over and over  again,<br />
          and I wonder if  there&rsquo;s a hammer,<br />
          beating us like a  sword smith,<br />
          cause that&rsquo;s what  they do,<br />
          string theory with metal,<br />
          they fold over the  steel,<br />
          and hit it,<br />
          and hit it, <br />
          and hit it.</p>
        <p>that year I had a  recurring dream<br />
          about junkyards as  far as my eyes could see: </p>
        <p>I drop to one knee,  and</p>
        <p>against the green  sky<br />
          the ground stands  firm<br />
          amidst old soda  cans, and<br />
          tightly wrapped  diapers,<br />
          and on the ground,  there's a painting,<br />
          the kind that I  usually hate,<br />
          the kind that&rsquo;s  painted in bulk<br />
          so there can be one  in every household,<br />
          with the palm trees  and the island<br />
          and the waves<br />
          and the birds in  the air,<br />
          and I see my face  in the dirty glass<br />
          and I understand<br />
          and I wake up,<br />
          and I'm sad.</p>
        <p>2. development</p>
        <p>from the second  story,<br />
          they move like  fish.<br />
          I watch them swim  in tequila and wine,<br />
          ears still ringing  from a show<br />
          two hours before.<br />
          sounds are muffled,<br />
          and in black  dresses, as I turn my head,<br />
          I vaguely recall  three clown fish<br />
          spraying each  passerby<br />
          in hopes of finding  fertility.<br />
          smoking cigarettes,<br />
          bubbles rise up to  wear I stand.<br />
          from the second  story,<br />
          I scientifically  watch piranha<br />
          move from group to  group<br />
          eating a limb every  now and them,<br />
          reminding me that <br />
          I admire  pragmatism,<br />
          and that I&rsquo;m a  juice filled worm.<br />
          from the second  story,<br />
          despite my  worminess,<br />
          the fishbowl seems  inviting.<br />
          the tops of their  heads float and bob,<br />
          their shoes,<br />
          they look like  sinkers.<br />
          I&rsquo;d love to cast a  line,<br />
          to be dragged  under, but,<br />
          it&rsquo;s much safer  from the top<br />
          looking down.<br />
          from the second  story,<br />
          the light plays  tricks on my eyes,<br />
          and I&rsquo;m sure  I'm&nbsp;inside water,<br />
          and I&rsquo;m amazed at  every breath<br />
          so I try a laugh,  to make sure<br />
          I&rsquo;m not drowning.<br />
          I swim down the  stairs slowly,<br />
          and my head feels  distorted,<br />
          and maybe I  shouldn&rsquo;t be driving,<br />
          but I want to be in  my car.<br />
          the fish brush up  against me, as <br />
          I search for a  door,<br />
          sending chills down  my spine<br />
          as their slime and  cold rubs off on me.<br />
          I sit in the  passenger seat of my car,<br />
          the one I had  bought,<br />
          my submarine car,<br />
          and rub my eyes  really hard,<br />
          till they water.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>3. recapitulation</p>
        <p>summer&rsquo;s a little  faster than our time <br />
          share allows,<br />
          so we idly sit on  neon colored yard<br />
          chairs, waiting,</p>
        <p>sunglasses facing  the baby blue sky<br />
          that&rsquo;s dotted by  horseflies.<br />
          they buzz like  electricity.</p>
        <p>the bugs barrage  our arms,<br />
          but we don&rsquo;t move  to swap them.<br />
          we are busy, <br />
          with all the yarn  in our pool.</p>
        <p>manually, we spin  in memory-s<br />
          from genghis khan <br />
          to chernobyl<br />
          and I laugh and say</p>
        <p>&ldquo;looks like god had  a case <br />
          of post partum  depression<br />
          a day or two after  creation&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;there&rsquo;s those  oatmans and tonopahs,<br />
          those ghost towns  that pop up every once in a while<br />
          like kids to the  fridge,<br />
          sort of like a  guard or a soldier in a <br />
          shakespeare play, you  know&hellip;<br />
          those vacancies  that help move along<br />
          the plot,<br />
          those alexandrias,  just waiting for some new<br />
          conqueror to move  in and reclaim and<br />
          rename&rdquo;</p>
        <p>vacancies, you  know, <br />
          fucking vacancies</p>
        <p>yan yan tethera-  the dead shepherd &rsquo;s language.<br />
          we&rsquo;re still  dreaming it everywhere.</p>
        <p>kids, teens,  adults, seniors,<br />
          they&rsquo;re all  sleeping,<br />
          talking to singing  sheep,<br />
  &ldquo;everything and  everything, that&rsquo;s us,&rdquo;<br />
          sing the sheep,<br />
  &ldquo;we&rsquo;re like the  comatose, the way we <br />
          sleep&hellip;<br />
          numbers and such,  and bringing people<br />
          back to life on the  ends of strings.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>it&rsquo;s hard to talk  to singing sheep,<br />
          ones whose thoughts  are in <br />
          a dead shepherd&rsquo;s  language.<br />
          you might say they  might as well<br />
          not have a voice at  all,<br />
          but there&rsquo;s just so  fucking many of them,<br />
          singing sheep  trying to sing louder <br />
          than other singing  sheep<br />
          and until they lead  themselves to the butcher,<br />
          the one they put in  business,<br />
          they&rsquo;re a bunch of  white fluff balls,<br />
          fighting over the  same fallacy.</p>
        <p>the memory pool is  deep now, <br />
          and bitter, and  we&rsquo;re thinking <br />
          of giant green  adult pine trees<br />
          roped out from  thousands of years ago.</p>
        <p>soon, we&rsquo;re talking  to each other about <br />
          parsimony,&nbsp; and cells,<br />
          and the fact that  our particles were once trees.</p>
        <p>i am not a tree.<br />
          honto? (really)<br />
          you can&rsquo;t climb me<br />
          odoroku (you&rsquo;d  surprise)<br />
          you can&rsquo;t climb me<br />
          betsu ni kammawan.  (pretty much <br />
          don&rsquo;t care)</p>
        <p>communication  breakdown plays <br />
          behind us.</p>
        <p>june bugs fuck each  other in the grass by our feet.</p>
        <p>and I&rsquo;m sure  somewhere cockroaches <br />
          are fucking each  other too.</p>
        <p>isn&rsquo;t it hilarious  that every moment is <br />
          the final product.<br />
          the height of  evolution,<br />
          the height of all  proceeding moments.</p>
        <p>probably some old  people too,<br />
          are adding to our  tapestry.</p>
        <p>on the lawn, as we  sit in neon colored<br />
          lawn chairs<br />
          with thirty dollar  sunny glass pipes<br />
          in hand,<br />
          smoking,<br />
          for the future.</p>
        <p>ashita (tomorrow)<br />
          wa onaji koto (will  the same)<br />
          ni naru dato omo&hellip;  (become I think)</p>
        <p>someday we&rsquo;ll make  sense of all this yarn<br />
          because the  quantity of one<br />
          still exists<br />
          even after <br />
          the numbers<br />
          one<br />
          through<br />
          infinity<br />
          are added.<br />
          nothing could be funnier. </p>
