    <td rowspan="28" align="left" valign="top"><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Story" --><font color="#FFFFFF">Teresa 
      Harpe shaded her eyes, surveying the rocky terrain above. All afternoon 
      they had scrambled up this ravine &#8211; she, Roger Tweedy, and thirteen 
      of their students from Seacrest High School. Every one of the six girls 
      and seven boys in the group had cycled through her PE classes at one time 
      or another &#8211; some of them more than once. Earlier in the day they 
      had hiked together, jostling and joking with one another, until gradually 
      most of the boys and a couple of the stronger girls had pulled ahead. As 
      the more experienced of the two leaders, Teresa tried to keep pace with 
      the frontrunners while Tweedy dropped behind with the stragglers. 
      <p>Directly ahead of her, 10th graders Adam and Cody ambled side by side 
        where the trail had turned temporarily to soft dirt and pine needles. 
        Further up, maybe sixty feet higher, three of the boys from the Seacrest 
        soccer team had stripped off their shirts and were scrambling over spires 
        and boulders towards the summit. </p>
      <p>&#8220;I got up to level fifty-three right before we left,&#8221; Adam 
        was saying. </p>
      <p>&#8220;Yeah? How long did it take?&#8221; asked Cody.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Like, eight hundred hours,&#8221; Adam said.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Eight hundred hours on World of Warcraft? Freakin-A, dude! That&#8217;s 
        like &#8230; six months of full-time work!&#8221; </p>
      <p>Teresa saw Adam glance at Kimberly Swank, who had veered off the trail 
        and was reaching for something on a pine branch overhead, exposing a smooth 
        tanned expanse of torso. The teacher smoothed her own waistline self-consciously. 
      </p>
      <p>&#8220;I want,&#8221; Adam said to Cody in a low voice.</p>
      </font>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;What?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Adam inclined his head in the girl&#8217;s direction.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Her? She&#8217;s a noob.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Yeah, but her social empire is vast.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;True,&#8221; Cody admitted.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Much want,&#8221; Adam said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Close behind him, Teresa chuckled quietly. Their 
        parents would be interested to learn some of the things she overheard 
        on a daily basis. Adam had been in her 4th period last semester. He was 
        one of the newer kids at school, well-liked but not athletic or handsome 
        enough to join the stratum of the social elite. In some ways he was kind 
        of homely &#8211; nose a little too fleshy, lips a little too full, hair 
        disheveled in a careless way, a lumbering gait, a little too soft in the 
        middle for a boy in his prime &#8211; but still not bad, considering how 
        much time these kids spent playing video games. In another way his homeliness 
        was almost fashionable &#8211; but surely not fashionable enough for the 
        likes of Kimberly Swank. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Teresa&#8217;s mind roamed again to the dream she&#8217;d 
        had the night before. In the dream she had been sitting in a lawn chair 
        dozing in the sun when she felt a tickle on the inside of her thigh and 
        looked down to find a stream of kids climbing up the hills and valleys 
        of her body. Creepy, she thought. Maybe all the time she&#8217;d spent 
        with teenagers over the past six years was getting to her. Week after 
        week, season after season, caught up in the daily drama of their youth. 
        And in the summer when most other teachers took the needed break, she 
        had turned right around every year and signed up for these adventure camps. 
        Next year I&#8217;ll take the summer off, she promised herself, go on 
        one of those barefoot cruises and meet a man. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">On the other hand, she really did enjoy the friendships 
        developed with these kids as a result of the extra time in summer. Sometimes 
        in the last weeks of August, after the camps ended and before school started, 
        she found herself wondering what she was missing as their lives continued 
        to play out in her absence. Was it loneliness she felt, or withdrawal?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">She stopped to catch her breath, leaning into the 
        smooth hard warmth of a boulder beside the trail. She scanned the higher 
        ground for the soccer players and noticed for the first time a patch of 
        gray sky creeping over the summit. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The rivulet of water falling over the rock face 
        above was barely visible from this distance. Here beside the trail it 
        trickled amicably down the ravine, joining eventually with another stream 
        before slipping into May Lake where they had set up their base camp several 
        days ago. As in former years, Teresa and the girls camped on the east 
        shore close to the high country outpost, while her male counterpart and 
        the boys set up further to the south, with the campfire and utility area 
        roughly in the middle. The separation wasn&#8217;t enough to prevent boys 
        and girls from visiting each other surreptitiously in the night if anyone 
        was really motivated, so the two chaperones sat sentry by the campfire 
        past bedtime each night until things quieted down. Over several nights 
        of this firelight vigil with Tweedy, secrets had been shared. It was normal, 
        it always happened at camp, with kids and adults both, but come daylight 
        Teresa had found herself regretting some of the things she&#8217;d revealed.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Now he came up beside her where she stood studying 
        the stream. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;There are three factors affecting the flow 
        of water &#8230;&#8221; he began. &#8220;Slope, volume, and &#8211; &#8220; 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I&#8217;m not one of your students, Tweedy,&#8221; 
        Teresa said with irritation.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, looking her up and down. 
        &#8220;Not by about twenty years I&#8217;d say, but you don&#8217;t look 
        half bad.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">She felt her hackles rise but forced herself to 
        be cool. He was baiting her, that&#8217;s all. &#8221;Listen, maybe the 
        school moms melt when you turn your puppy-dog eyes on them, but I know 
        you for the conceited twit you really are.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Oh Harpie, you don&#8217;t have to be defensive. 
        I&#8217;d take you in a minute if it wasn&#8217;t a sure way to end my 
        career. &#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">She stared at him for a moment, acknowledging the 
        fluttery sensation in her chest. He hadn&#8217;t said anything about his 
        marriage. &#8220;My standards are way higher than that, Twee,&#8221; she 
        said finally. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;On the other hand, we could go off into 
        the woods tonight &#8211; nobody would ever know.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, why don&#8217;t you 
        go home and make love to your wife? Maybe then you&#8217;d leave the rest 
        of us alone.&#8221; She scowled at him. &#8220;I hope I won&#8217;t have 
        to put up with you again next summer.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Not that I&#8217;ll be here myself, she reminded 
        herself.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;You might, if my house is still under construction. 
        If it is I&#8217;ll have to go somewhere.&#8221; He snapped the suspenders 
        holding up his khakis and grinned at her. Of course his house would still 
        be under construction &#8211; the rumor was it had been under construction 
        for about eight years so far.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Teresa had once observed Tweedy in the classroom 
        and had to admit there wasn&#8217;t another teacher who had as much rapport 
        with the kids. The problem was that he knew how good he was. He had built 
        a legacy on it. Every 11th grader wanted him for calculus, and every Halloween 
        several of them could be seen running around campus dressed as &#8220;Mr. 
        Twee,&#8221; in striped dress shirts, neckties and suspenders, berets 
        perched at cocky angles on top of hair spray-painted with gray streaks. 
        His classroom was always open after school for help with term projects 
        and test prep, or just for lounging around on the old couches he&#8217;d 
        dragged in. The janitor hated him as much as the kids worshipped him &#8211; 
        what with the constant mess of adolescence that filled the room and flowed 
        out the doorway. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">A clap of thunder sounded over the mountaintop 
        and rolled down the ravine. They looked up towards the sound and saw that 
        the soccer players had made it to the top and were relaxing on boulders 
        in the gold sunlight of late afternoon. Behind them the eastern sky had 
        gone to deep purple. Cody and Adam were together at the base of the steep 
        climb and starting up. The lovely Kimberly, taking long strides, had closed 
        the distance between herself and the two boys. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I think we better hold up here,&#8221; Teresa 
        said. If she wasn&#8217;t mistaken, the trickle of water had widened slightly. 
        Judging by the darkening sky and the thunder, it was probably raining 
        somewhere higher in the Sierra. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Tweedy gathered the larger group around him and 
        called to Kimberly, but she ignored him and continued up. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">What is the girl thinking? Teresa wondered. She 
        moved closer to the pile of rock at the base. &#8220;Ten minutes!&#8221; 
        she yelled, pointing to her watch. &#8220;Wherever you are in ten minutes, 
        turn around and get back down here!&#8221; Another clap sounded. The soccer 
        players got lazily to their feet, looking over their shoulders towards 
        the rumbling. They pulled on their shirts and started down, crossing paths 
        with Adam and Cody about halfway.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">When the water surged, Teresa and the group down 
        below froze, gaping uphill while the scene unfolded before them. Adam 
        and Cody had just crossed the stream where it flowed ankle-deep at a saddle 
        in the ravine. Close behind and trying to catch up, Kimberly plunged sloppily 
        after them and paused halfway, apparently puzzled, just as the flow thickened, 
        now suddenly knee-deep, chalky, turbulent. Too late, she realized her 
        predicament and lost her footing, slipping into a gulley where the force 
        of the stream now threatened to overcome her. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Adam swung around at the sound of her scream and 
        leaped back to pull her out. Half submerged himself, he managed to push 
        her from behind to Cody&#8217;s outstretched hand an instant before an 
        errant log came hurtling by. Even from this far away Teresa could see 
        his teeth bared in determination as he heaved himself out. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">None of them saw the rock dislodged from higher 
        up until it had smashed against Adam&#8217;s skull and then went careening 
        down the ravine towards the group at the base. Teresa gasped and held 
        her breath as he tumbled over the face of the boulder, landing fifteen 
        feet down in a rocky crevasse. She saw rather than heard Kimberly scream 
        again and try to go after him, watched as Cody grabbed her arm and held 
        on until she stopped struggling. She breathed again when the two had backed 
        off as far from the torrent as the landscape allowed and huddled together 
        on the wrong side of the ravine. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Suddenly aware now of the pandemonium behind her, 
        Teresa tore her eyes from a strip of Adam&#8217;s red t-shirt where he 
        lay motionless, away from the flow of water. Thank God for that, she thought. 
        She turned to Tweedy who stood as though paralyzed, a couple of the girls 
        in his arms, their faces stunned and drained of color.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Get all of them to higher ground,&#8221; 
        she said. She turned and grabbed one of the soccer players. &#8220;Niko, 
        find two branches about five feet long.&#8221; He jumped to obey and Teresa 
        looked for a place lower down to cross the stream. She found it and motioned 
        to Niko.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Tweedy came to life. &#8220;Hold on now,&#8221; 
        he said breaking away from the girls. &#8220;You&#8217;d better stay here 
        with the kids &#8211; I&#8217;ll go.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Teresa&#8217;s irritation rose again. Of course 
        he would want to go &#8211; that would make him the hero. &#8220;Tweedy, 
        I have paramedic training and I&#8217;ve climbed this mountain twelve 
        times in the past six summers. How many times have you?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Well, none, but I&#8217;m stronger and 
        taller. It&#8217;s not right for you to go.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Physical fitness is my profession,&#8221; 
        she snapped, &#8220;and Niko is taller and stronger than anyone here.&#8221; 
        Besides, she thought, Adam is my student. He won&#8217;t be yours until 
        Fall.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll go with along with you both,&#8221; 
        Tweedy said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;One of us has to stay here until Kimberly 
        and Cody get down, then take the group back to camp.&#8221; She paused. 
        &#8220;The kids are upset, Tweedy. They need you to stay with them, not 
        me.&#8221; She saw him accept the compliment, then turned back to Niko. 
        &#8220;Come on &#8211; we&#8217;re wasting time!&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">They crossed the stream and hiked quickly to assist 
        Kimberly and Cody with the sticks Niko had collected, then turned their 
        attention to Adam. Twenty minutes later they had managed to pull him from 
        the crevasse and lay him across the level top of a large boulder. He was 
        conscious, but barely. His head was gashed and bleeding above the right 
        ear. One leg was obviously broken, his skin cool and pale. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Much hurt,&#8221; Adam mumbled. He shivered 
        uncontrollably, in spite of the late afternoon warmth.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I know it hurts but we&#8217;re going to 
        take care of you,&#8221; Teresa said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get these wet 
        clothes off him and let the heat of the rock warm him up,&#8221; she said 
        to Niko. She found a pocketknife in the fanny pack with the first aid 
        kit. While she treated the head injury and stabilized the bone in his 
        leg, Niko cut off his clothing, careful not to wrench his leg or move 
        him too much. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Ms. Harpe, I forgot my gym clothes today,&#8221; 
        Adam said, slurring the words. Teresa took off the windbreaker tied around 
        her waist and covered him. If he was delirious, getting him back to camp 
        would be difficult. She worked faster.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">When finally they could concentrate on getting 
        off the mountain, the sun sat nearly on the western fringe of mountains 
        in the distance. For half an hour they tried lowering the boy from the 
        boulder, but he was in too much pain to cooperate. Teresa remembered hearing 
        that an ordeal like this was a lot easier if the victim was unconscious, 
        and now she understood. She had painkillers in her kit that would put 
        him to sleep, but Adam had symptoms of hypothermia. If that was the case 
        it was crucial to keep him awake. She pulled out the walkie talkie attached 
        to her belt and radioed down. The rest of the group might be halfway back 
        to camp by now, she thought. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I need dry clothes for Adam,&#8221; she 
        said when Tweedy answered, &#8220;and two sleeping bags. A pup tent, flashlights, 
        some rope, a thermos of hot tea, and some cookies. Put everything in a 
        backpack and have someone start up to meet me. We aren&#8217;t going to 
        be able to bring him down ourselves, so call for assistance.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Niko had made Adam comfortable on top of the boulder 
        again. &#8220;I want you to cover him with your body until I get back,&#8221; 
        she said. &#8220;And keep him awake, do you understand?&#8221; She looked 
        to Niko for confirmation and saw that he was staring at her with an unfathomable 
        expression on his face. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I can&#8217;t do that Ms. Harpe,&#8221; 
        he said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;What? You can&#8217;t do what?&#8221; she 
        said, but already she knew. In the six years she had been doing these 
        trips with the kids, they always spent one night in a motel on the way 
        up here. Of course she had never been the boys&#8217; chaperone during 
        these overnights &#8211; that was a man&#8217;s job &#8211; but she remembered 
        a remark made by one of the male teachers on a former trip. There would 
        be four boys in a room with two queen beds, but only two would end up 
        in beds because two of them could not, would not share a bed, no matter 
        how uncomfortable the floor. Girls had no problem with it, but boys at 
        this age were hopelessly homophobic. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Niko, this is a matter of life or death. 
        Nobody is going to see you, and Adam could die if his body temperature 
        drops too low.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Niko shook his head and refused to look at her. 
        &#8220;No,&#8221; he said quietly.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Okay,&#8221; she huffed. &#8220;I will stay 
        here. You will go down the mountain and get the supplies. Get going now. 
        Be careful, but get back up here as fast as you can.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Niko took off like a bolt, and Teresa stretched 
        out beside Adam on the boulder. It still held the warmth of the sun, but 
        his skin was cool and the air temperature was dropping fast. She was always 
        surprised at how cold the nights could be here in midsummer. She adjusted 
        the jacket over them and wrapped herself around him. He moaned very quietly, 
        and she patted his face to rouse him. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Hey, you&#8217;re a real hero, you know? 
        Saving Kimberly like that?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">He opened his eyes but didn&#8217;t say anything.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;She would have been in deep shit if you 
        hadn&#8217;t been there.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I like her a lot,&#8221; he said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;She likes you, too.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Naw.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Sure she does. Why else would she try so 
        hard to catch up with you?&#8221; Teresa had no idea why the girl had 
        tried so hard, but anything to keep him awake and thinking.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">He moaned again. &#8220;My leg,&#8221; he said. 
        &#8220;I need to go home now.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I know, Adam. You&#8217;ve probably never 
        hurt as much as you do right now. But everything&#8217;s going to be all 
        right. We&#8217;re going to get you home.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Once before I moved here &#8230;&#8221; 
        he said and stopped. His breathing had become shallow. Teresa shook him 
        gently and he took a deeper breath and went on. &#8220;uh, I was riding 
        with my step dad on his tractor. We hit a bump and I fell off and my head 
        came down on the plough. I could tell it was bleeding &#8216;cause the 
        dirt around me was all bloody wet. My dad told me to go on home so I walked 
        back to the house and looked for my mom. She was working in the garden 
        and called me a crybaby, then everything went black and I bonked my head 
        on the steps in front of the house.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Wow, twice in one day?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;This hurts more.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;How old were you?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220; Mm &#8230; eleven?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Do they still have the farm?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Naw. They broke up and sold it. That&#8217;s 
        when I came here to live with my dad and step mom.&#8221; The story seemed 
        to have exhausted him. He started shivering again, and Teresa took off 
        her t-shirt and shorts and laid them over him, then rearranged herself 
        around him as best she could without hurting him. She felt his coolness 
        drawing her warmth, and snuggled closer to create as much contact as possible. 
        As long as he kept shivering he was probably okay &#8211; it was when 
        they stopped you had to worry. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Her mind wandered. Last night in the lull before 
        dinner, bending over his backpack with hair falling over his face, Adam 
        had looked up and locked eyes with her for a moment, startling her with 
        their blue intensity. In that instant he reminded her of another boy with 
        startling blue eyes and full lips, one she hadn&#8217;t thought of in 
        a long time. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Tim was his name. He was someone she knew in high 
        school. She had gone to a few football games with him, to a drive-in movie 
        once, just around the time her father was transferred to another city 
        by the company he worked for. After she moved away, Tim called and invited 
        her to come back and go to prom with him. Her parents, probably to assuage 
        their guilt for moving her in the middle of junior year, had let her fly 
        back for the dance. It was a fun time. They got a lot of attention, she 
        as the out-of-towner, and he as the just-elected student body president 
        for the upcoming school year when they would both be seniors. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">That summer he had ridden his bicycle almost five 
        hundred miles, half the length of California, to visit her. It took him 
        a couple of weeks, and along the way he sent postcards. One she remembered 
        was written from a convent somewhere off Highway 101 where he was held 
        up for a few days with water on the knee. When he finally got to her family&#8217;s 
        new house he slept in the den downstairs, where one night she snuck down 
        and slipped into bed with him. She didn&#8217;t intend anything, really, 
        but maybe the convent business had made her feel a little like she owed 
        him. Anyway, her dad had come down before much could happen and sent her 
        back upstairs. When Tim finally loaded up his bike and flew home a week 
        later, still nothing had happened. The letters that came afterwards expressed 
        frustration at first, then despair, and finally became distant. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">In the Fall he was crowned Homecoming King and 
        took one of her girlfriends to the dance. &#8220;I wanted you to come,&#8221; 
        he wrote. &#8220;But being with her reminds me of you, and besides, she&#8217;s 
        here.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Teresa didn&#8217;t care much one way or another. 
        She had discovered surfers, with their wide muscled shoulders and narrow 
        waists, and by then had given her virginity to one of them instead. Later 
        she married one, but divorced him five years later when he had developed 
        a beer belly and it became clear he would never keep a job. The ten years 
        since then she had devoted to her career.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I would have been Homecoming Queen. The thought 
        startled her, and she felt something shift inside. I could have stuck 
        with Tim, even though we lived far apart. I could have married him, and 
        by now we might have a son just like this kid in my arms. I wouldn&#8217;t 
        neglect him like his parents do, bouncing him from one step family to 
        another. I would keep him safe.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Adam stirred. She became aware of his physical 
        presence again and gathered him closer, protectively. Her next thought 
        startled her even more. I want this boy. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Nonsense, she corrected herself. I&#8217;m tired 
        and I&#8217;m losing it. I&#8217;m just a pathetic, tired old maid. All 
        the same, she couldn&#8217;t prevent the surge of emotion washing over 
        her. Sometime later when Niko and another of the soccer players arrived 
        with the pack of supplies she was still grappling with her feelings. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Mr. Twee says it&#8217;ll take a couple 
        of hours to get a rescue crew up here,&#8221; Niko said. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Teresa released Adam and got busy unpacking the 
        tent. &#8220;Help me out here guys,&#8221; she said. They didn&#8217;t 
        move, and she looked at them in the moonlight. Both were staring at her, 
        motionless, mouths hanging open. She remembered what she must look like 
        to them and thought of grabbing her clothes, but that would leave Adam 
        unprotected. &#8220;For heaven&#8217;s sake, you&#8217;ve seen half naked 
        women before &#8211; you live at the beach!&#8221; she said, crossing 
        her arms over her body. &#8220;Now please, please, let&#8217;s get this 
        tent set up.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> When the rescue team arrived, they had erected 
        the tent and arranged Adam under it with one sleeping bag as padding and 
        another as covering. He had drunk a cup of tea and eaten a cookie. The 
        three of them had settled on a strategy of chitchat that kept him busy 
        answering easy questions that didn&#8217;t tire him too much but kept 
        him awake. They knew his favorite ice cream, pie, movie, and a dozen other 
        favorites. They knew there were a lot of people living in his house &#8211; 
        &#8220;They won&#8217;t stop moving long enough to count &#8216;em.&#8221; 
        Humor, that was a good sign. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Teresa and the two soccer players arrived back 
        at base camp ahead of the rescue crew and found the group gathered intimately 
        around the campfire, comforting each other while Tweedy spoke quietly 
        with one and then another. Kimberly looked up when they arrived, her face 
        beautiful in the firelight, soft cheeks slick with tears. &#8220;He&#8217;s 
        going to be all right,&#8221; Teresa said, and Kimberly buried her head 
        in her arms.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">******</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> The first time Teresa stood on the doorstep of 
        Adam&#8217;s family&#8217;s house, she hesitated a minute before knocking. 
        She had never had reason to visit a student at home and was surprised 
        how easy it was to find the address in the student directory &#8211; shouldn&#8217;t 
        they be more anonymous than that? </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">But this is just a courtesy call to see how he&#8217;s 
        recovering, she told herself. Yes, and you know you want to look at him 
        again. You want to see that spark in his eyes. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The family received her with ease, which boosted 
        her confidence. She became a frequent visitor in the remaining weeks of 
        summer. She brought pecan pie (his favorite), raspberry sorbet (another 
        favorite), and gifts for the little brothers &#8211; who truly did move 
        too fast to count. On more than one occasion Kimberly was also there visiting, 
        each time registering a brief look of surprise before politely returning 
        the teacher&#8217;s greeting and retreating shyly into Adam&#8217;s room 
        with him. In spite of herself, Teresa felt a jolt of jealousy each time 
        the door clicked shut behind them.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> It wasn&#8217;t until school began again in the 
        Fall that she became aware several different versions of the story had 
        circulated around campus. She was surprised, but made no effort to give 
        an official version. Eventually she noticed that the easy way the kids 
        used to have around her had become strained &#8211; no longer did they 
        divulge information in her presence, and when she approached their little 
        groups during class they often became silent. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">When she overheard Adam telling a friend that his 
        counselor wouldn&#8217;t let him switch out of a class he didn&#8217;t 
        want, she ran interference for him in the counselor&#8217;s office. Soon 
        after, when they crossed paths and she asked how his leg was healing, 
        he crossed his arms and leaned against the wall before answering. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Ms. Harpe,&#8221; he said quietly without 
        looking at her, &#8220;I&#8217;m really fine. Please don&#8217;t help 
        me anymore.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> In October there was a memo in her mailbox from 
        the superintendent of the school district. Not an email, but a memo typed 
        on letterhead, stapled closed and left in her box in the faculty office. 
        She didn&#8217;t fail to consider the implication. Her presence was required 
        at an informal hearing, it said. Legal counsel wouldn&#8217;t be necessary 
        but allowable if she so desired. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> It had come to their attention that some of the 
        soccer players were uncomfortable in her PE classes, they told her at 
        the hearing. Under questioning, two of the boys mentioned the incident 
        at summer camp, which was not objectionable per se, but several others 
        alluded to a continued relationship with the injured student. When Adam 
        was questioned about it, he had not verified that any kind of relationship 
        had ensued, but was clearly uncomfortable about the whole thing. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">It was also hinted she may have ordered one of 
        the kids on the trip to commit a homosexual act, and that she had openly 
        discussed Roger Tweedy&#8217;s sexual relationship with his wife in front 
        of the students. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Of course she was to be commended for the valiant 
        manner in which she had responded to a life-threatening situation, but 
        surely she also understood their position. She could resign now, or they 
        could launch a full-blown investigation into her background and the incident 
        in question. Every student would be questioned, every detail of her behavior 
        that day gone over with a fine-toothed comb. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">She thought the truth would prevail if it came 
        to that, but lately she had been ruminating on the details of her own 
        life in a way that felt inappropriate, even to herself. Perhaps she was 
        no longer fit to work with teenagers, especially the boys. When she announced 
        her decision to resign, a shockwave ran through campus. &#8220;See?&#8221; 
        she overheard a faculty member say, &#8220;It&#8217;s all true then, everything 
        they&#8217;ve been saying about her &#8230;&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">And maybe it is, Teresa thought to herself, yes, 
        maybe it is.</font><br>
