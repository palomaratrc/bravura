      me because it&#8217;s the mother -fuckin&#8217; truth.&#8221; Julian said 
      as he exhaled a large cloud of smoke. </font>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know Jules, I mean, I&#8217;m 
        just sayin&#8217; it&#8217;s kinda hard to believe. Two ball corner pocket.&#8221; 
        Rob replied as he draped himself over the pool table and squinted at his 
        target. Julian&#8217;s dark brown eyes followed the two ball as it dropped 
        in the hole. His pint was heavy in his hand even though it was only half 
        full of Coors Original. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;You&#8217;re telling me that Face did that 
        to you? The Face? I don&#8217;t know man, your face looks like shit&#8212;especially 
        that gash&#8221; Rob pointed to his own left cheek &#8220;Good God, shouldn&#8217;t 
        you get that stitched?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing.&#8221; Julian interrupted 
        and then took a drag from his cigarette.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Anyways, I&#8217;m just saying dude, Face 
        doesn&#8217;t just fight people, the dude kills people. My sister&#8217;s 
        friend Jess-i-ca&#8230;no&#8230;Samantha! Samantha works for the DA or 
        the DEA, or something like that, and she says that there is a file on 
        Face this thick.&#8221; He held his hands about a foot apart from each 
        other like he was playing the accordion &#8220;this thick with drug, weapon, 
        theft.&#8221; he began to counting on his fingers &#8220;grand theft auto, 
        illegal gambling, oh yeah, and murder, did I mention murder. You&#8217;re 
        an idiot for going down there. Remember when we were kids and that dude 
        Tony was stabbed to death on the South Side? You should just stay away 
        from there all together man. Bad dice.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;You&#8217;ve never even met Face. You have 
        no idea what you are talking about you&#8217;re the fucking idiot.&#8221; 
        Julian said setting his cigarette down in the ash tray. He snatched Rob&#8217;s 
        pool stick from him bitterly. &#8220;Nine ball left pocket.&#8221; he 
        said as he perched on the ground closed his left eyes, raised his right 
        eyebrow, and concentrated on his shot.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Whatever, so how do you know em&#8217;?&#8221; 
        Rob asked. He was leaning against the table, arms crossed and his blonde 
        eyebrows raised in interest, looking down at Julian who was about to finally 
        make his shot. Rob never quite noticed how shiny Julian&#8217;s hair was; 
        black and slick, you could see the blue and red reflections from the neon 
        bar lights all around them on the back of his head. Julian held his breath 
        as he gently slid the stick back and forth in his hand. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Kittens.&#8221; Julian replied. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Kittens?&#8221; Rob asked as he took a 
        drag from Julian&#8217;s cigarette and then put it out.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Yup&#8221; Julian hit the yellow-striped 
        ball beautifully made a perfect obtuse angel across the table and fell 
        in the left pocket. Julian grabbed his Coors, which was now almost gone, 
        and sat on a tall wooden stool next to Rob. Rob just stared at him and 
        waited for the story. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;This guy approached me on Eighth Street,&#8221; 
        Julian began, &#8220;with a stack of these green flyers. I didn&#8217;t 
        know what to make of him, I mean, he looked like he had money but he was 
        dressed like a total fag. You know, he had on like brown dress shoes and 
        shit with like a brown suit with orange pinstripes and an orange hat. 
        Like one of those hats that old school gangsters wear but orange, not 
        black with pinstripes, just bright orange, crazy shit dude. &#8220;Julian 
        lit another cigarette. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;What did he say?&#8221; Rob asked?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Julian exhaled. &#8220;He told me he would give 
        me fifty bucks if I plastered the streets with these flyers. He wanted 
        me to put them on telephone poles and shit, it was a reward poster.&#8221; 
        he said. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Reward for what?&#8221; </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Kittens! Fucking cats!&#8221; Julian shouted. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Rob laughed at Julian&#8217;s sudden excitement. 
        &#8220;Kittens huh, like a whole litter of kittens or just one cat?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;It was a green flyer with two kittens on 
        it, I hate cats but I&#8217;ll admit they were pretty cute. &#8220; </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;What was the reward?&#8221; </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Ten-thousand bucks.&#8221; Julian responded. 
        </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Wow, those must have been some pretty important 
        cats.&#8221; Rob replied as he took a seat on the other wooden stool next 
        to Julian. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220; Yeah, I know that now but at the time 
        I was a moron. All I saw were those giant letters &#8220;REWARD&#8221; 
        and I went crazy. I could use the money you know, that would be sweet, 
        so I took the job. Whatever, I already had the fifty bucks, the weirdo 
        paid that up front, and I could find the cats and be a hero, I had nothing 
        to lose.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;So what happened?&#8221; Rob asked. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Well, as I was hanging up the posters I 
        started going mad. All that money, I just wanted it, you know? Why shouldn&#8217;t 
        I have it? And I felt lucky you know, like there was a chance I could 
        actually find them. Before I knew it I had tucked the rest of the flyers 
        in my back pocket, I didn&#8217;t even care about hanging up the posters 
        because I knew I could find them. I knew it.&#8221; Julian said as he 
        finished the rest of his beer. He picked his cigarette out of the ash 
        tray but it had been sitting there smoldering for so long that it had 
        gone out already. He looked at it annoyingly and just set it back in the 
        cheap plastic ash tray. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Did you find them?&#8221; Rob asked impatiently. 
        </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Well, not really.&#8221; Julian replied. 
        </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Not really?&#8221; </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Well I thought I had found them. They were 
        in a dumpster behind Lucky&#8217;s General Store. I asked Lucky if he 
        had seen any cats and he told me that there had been two kittens living 
        by the dumpsters for the last two days. This had to be the same kittens 
        on the flyer&#8221; Julian lit another cigarette &#8220;So I went out 
        there and found them eating vomit, it looked like the cats in the picture, 
        but the picture was black and white and I couldn&#8217;t really tell but 
        this had to be them.&#8221; Julian said picking up his beer only to remember 
        it was empty. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Vomit?&#8221; Rob asked.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know what the hell 
        it was but it looked like vomit. So I picked them up and threw them in 
        an old apple box. The address on the flyer was 6845A, Eleventh Street, 
        so I figured I would just go over there and drop them off. I was going 
        to be a hero. This had to have been the same cats from the flyer. One 
        was all black with a white belly and the other was solid black. In the 
        picture the solid black one had a white foot but I figured the copier 
        probably just fucked up. This had to be them&#8221; Julian said as he 
        inhaled. Rob just stared him.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Get to the freakin&#8217; point already.&#8221; 
        Rob snapped. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Julian exhaled. &#8220;OK OK, so I get there and 
        this other guy, this time in just a white t-shirt and jeans, nothing faggoty, 
        answered the door. It was like some old warehouse or something, just a 
        big building with no windows and nothing inside of it. It was really creepy 
        but whatever. I showed him the cats and he said that Face was going to 
        be so happy I found them. &#8220; Julian said </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Face likes cats?&#8221; Rob asked. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Apparently, I was like &#8220;Face? What 
        the Fuck?&#8221; I guess even drug lords and murderers have a soft spot 
        for kittens but whatever all I cared about was the money anyways. So he 
        led me to the back end of the warehouse. It smelled old and dusty in there 
        and all the lights were off. There were just a few dim floor lights along 
        the path to this giant metal desk that had a dim fancy lamp on it. I was 
        really creeped out man, I won&#8217;t lie. The whole thing creeped me 
        the fuck out. &#8220; Julian said. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;But the money gave you courage right?&#8221; 
        Rob asked.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Yeah! The money, I was excited about getting 
        the money I didn&#8217;t even care. &#8220; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Rob nodded.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;So behind the desk there was this giant 
        office chair but the back was turned to me so I couldn&#8217;t see who 
        was sitting in it, and the fag in the orange was sitting on the desk. 
        He asked to see the cats so I showed them to him, he studied them and 
        then walked around to the front of the chair and handed them to whoever 
        was sitting in it. &#8220;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Face?&#8221; Rob asked. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Exactly but then Face put them down on 
        the ground in the box and whispered something to the orange guy. The guy 
        said he was sorry and thanks for all my help but these weren&#8217;t the 
        right cats. I was like what the fuck? These were the cats in the picture, 
        I told him to put a better picture on the flyer and then maybe I wouldn&#8217;t 
        have wasted my time trying to help. I was so pissed that they weren&#8217;t 
        going to give me the money. I told that faggot that he was lying and that 
        those were the right cats and that this was all just a scam and he could 
        go fuck himself. See if I ever help him again.&#8221; Julian said as he 
        picked up his cigarette and took a drag again. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;So since you were talkin&#8217; shit Face 
        stood up and kicked your ass eh?&#8221; Rob asked growing impatient. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;No, not exactly. I just stood there and 
        Face whispered something to the orange dude and then him and the other 
        guy got up and left. &#8220; </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Then Face kicked your ass?&#8221; Rob interrupted. 
        </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Well not right at that moment. First Face 
        turned around and I saw the notorious Face in the light and now I understand 
        the rumors because it was a face that you don&#8217;t forget.&#8221; Julian 
        said. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Rob opened his mouth to interrupt but Julian just 
        put out his hand and shushed him. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I cannot describe that face to you even 
        if I tried, just believe me it was shocking. So there I was face to face 
        with The Face. We talked for a little bit and I don&#8217;t know what 
        came over me but my anger subsided. We basically just shot the shit for 
        a little while and then the guy in orange came back over to me all pissed 
        off. I don&#8217;t even know where he came from he was just there all 
        of a sudden, pissed. I thought everything was cool I didn&#8217;t know 
        what the fuck was going on. But you see I forgot to take those flyers 
        out of my back pocket and the orange guy saw it and he was pissed. He 
        pulled them outta my pocket and slammed them down on the desk. Face just 
        stared at them, I fucked up I knew it. I tried to explain but the orange 
        guy just kept saying that The Face doesn&#8217;t like it when people don&#8217;t 
        do the jobs that they are paid to do.&#8221; Julian said as he took a 
        quick drag. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Face sounds like a scary dude.&#8221; Rob 
        commented. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Scary dude doesn&#8217;t even come close 
        to describing The Face. &#8220; Julian said. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;So he kicked you ass then or what?&#8221; 
        </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Basically the other dude left the room 
        and it was just me and Face. I tried to defend myself and to be honest 
        I don&#8217;t remember much. I remember my right eye starting to throb 
        and I remember touching my cheek and then seeing the blood on my hand. 
        All there was were screams and flashes and blows to my head. I got a few 
        good hits in though, I know that for sure. Believe me all this week it 
        will be The Bruised Face because of me. Next thing I remember is waking 
        up in the gutter on Seventh Street.&#8220; Julian said with a nervous 
        laugh. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Wow, I guess Face has a softer side with 
        the cats and all. Plus he didn&#8217;t kill you, but what&#8217;s with 
        the dude in orange? It&#8217;s so fucking weird man.&#8221; Rob said standing 
        up.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I know, you&#8217;re telling me.&#8221; 
        Julian put out his cigarette. &#8220;I gotta take a leak dude, this beer 
        went straight through me, I&#8217;ll be right back.&#8221; Julian said. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Rob nodded and went back to making his shot he 
        couldn&#8217;t remember if he was stripes or solids so he stood there 
        for a moment, just staring at the table with his stick in his hand. He 
        looked up and saw Julian disappearing behind the wall with the giant red 
        neon Budweiser sign that had a red, white, and blue American flag underneath 
        it. His eyes wandered to the right where something caught his eye. The 
        front door opened and very attractive woman came through. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Her standing in the doorway, letting in the light 
        into the dark bar, was like a solar eclipse and Rob couldn&#8217;t stop 
        staring at. She darted her eyes around the room until she saw a nearby 
        table with a man in a navy blue suit and a neon green tie. She walked 
        up to him and hugged him and then headed over to the bar. Rob admired 
        her tiny body, only about 5&#8217;3, which was a good height for him because 
        he was kind of short. Her hair was down to her hips, dark black and she 
        had eyes to match it. Her skin was not at all pale but it wasn&#8217;t 
        tanned either, it was just perfect, and the tight blue mini dress she 
        wore radiated her beauty across the dimly lit bar. Rob gravitated towards 
        her like he was floating on some invisible radio wave.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Once he got to the bar she was already comfortably 
        sitting in a stool near the end. He could see an innocent glow that surrounded 
        her face, like a dream. He was intoxicated by her beauty and felt like 
        he was going into some kind of shock. He raised his hand ready to tell 
        Roger, the bartender, to get the lady whatever she wanted, on his tab 
        naturally, but Roger spoke first, not noticing that Rob was standing there. 
        </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Hey Face! I haven&#8217;t seen you around 
        here in a long time! The usual?&#8221; Roger asked. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Rob just bit his tongue, turned around, and walked 
        away. </font><br>
      </p>
