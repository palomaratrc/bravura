      Wei had a terrible nightmare. He awoke with a start. A bad dream, an ox, 
      but why today? </font>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Mother, mother,&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;I 
        saw an ox. It chased me.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Chang&#8217;s mother ran into his bedroom, hugged 
        her son, and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry little one. Maybe your dream 
        was a good omen. You&#8217;re Year-of-the-Ox boy, and you show it every 
        day. You&#8217;re a good student. Your father and I are very proud of 
        you. Now calm down my precious child and enjoy your festive day. Today 
        you&#8217;re seven years old.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Chang slowly pulled away from his mother and said, 
        &#8220;I&#8217;m not an Ox!&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Little one, it depends on the year you 
        were born. It&#8217;s your special sign and not a real animal. Hurry up, 
        or you&#8217;ll be late to school.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Chang Wei grabbed his books and his lunch box 
        and then carefully closed the front door. Joining his friend Wang Tao, 
        he walked up the steep hill to the elementary school.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Wang Tao, today&#8217;s my birthday. My 
        mother told me that something good will happen today.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Wang said, &#8220;I got a bicycle for my birthday. 
        It&#8217;s mine, and nobody but me can ride it. Nobody... Did you ask 
        for a bicycle?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;No, but we&#8217;d better walk faster. 
        Can&#8217;t be late,&#8221; said Chang. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Madame Wu was standing by the school door, rigid 
        and erect. Dressed in her usual blue blouse and pants with her dark hair 
        pulled back in a tight bun, her piercing black eyes quickly scanned the 
        students, and she said, &#8220;Line up. Line up now, and enter the classroom.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> All the children heeded her instructions and quietly 
        began to file into a Spartan room. Depositing their lunches at the back 
        of the room, they sat down at simple wooden desks and turned their attention 
        to Madame Wu.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Good morning. Stand up,&#8221; she said. 
        Walking to the record player, she turned it on and the National Anthem 
        blared forth. All the students stood at attention and sang the song loudly. 
        Then Madam Wu ordered, &#8220;Be seated and take out your reader.&#8221; 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Chang anxiously watched the clock, waiting for 
        his special moment.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> After the reading lesson Madame Wu said, &#8220;Put 
        your books away. Glancing at Chang Wei she said, &#8220;Chang, stand up.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> He thought, &#8220;Is this my special moment?&#8221; 
        </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;You have 10 seconds to add 3,786 plus 8,394 
        plus 9,282.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> He quickly calculated and said, &#8220;22,462.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Madame Wu stared at him, shook her head, and said, 
        &#8220;Wrong. The correct answer is 21,462.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Chang Wei had indeed made an error. It was a routine 
        problem for him, to quickly, with no pencil and paper, mentally add three 
        four-digit numbers in his head, and recite the answer aloud. He had given 
        the wrong answer, and it was inexcusable.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Turning to the class Madam Wu loudly demanded, 
        &#8220;Heads bowed. Eyes closed. You heard me. Heads bowed. Chang Wei 
        has made a mistake. He has shamed the entire class. His shame must now 
        be borne by all of you. As I&#8217;ve always told you, a mistake by any 
        one student brings disgrace to our school and the party leadership of 
        Zhangtze Prefecture.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Madam Wu said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be leaving the 
        room now for a few minutes. Continue your silence. Contemplate Chang Wei&#8217;s 
        shame!&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> For classmate Lin Xue, Chang&#8217;s mistake was 
        a wonderful respite from his lordly dominance. Lin, a pretty and very 
        intelligent little girl, was well above average when it came to math skills, 
        but she was always second behind Chang, which was O.K., in a way, because 
        Chang never made mistakes.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Chang and Lin sat at their desks with their heads 
        bowed, as directed, and tears were beginning to well in the young boy&#8217;s 
        eyes. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> She could not restrain herself, and she glanced 
        at Chang and whispered,&#8220; Are you sad about your disgrace, Chang 
        Wei?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I feel terrible.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;This may damage your reputation a little,&#8221; 
        she continued, &#8220;but don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t I?&#8221; His tears 
        were now beginning to flow down his cheeks and were choking him a bit.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Your father and mother will have to share 
        your disgrace, too, but don&#8217;t worry, they love you.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Chang Wei was nearly speechless, sobbing. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Lin Xue said, &#8220;Your father was going to 
        ask the Party to send you to The Beijing Academy some day, wasn&#8217;t 
        he? But there are other schools. Local schools are adequate. Don&#8217;t 
        worry.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Through his ever-increasing tears he muttered, 
        &#8220;Thank you, Lin Xue. I&#8217;ll try not to worry.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> She was getting warmed-up now, &#8220;Chang Wei, 
        you&#8217;ve always told me how your grandfather, the head of the medical 
        school, wanted you to exceed the perfect academic record of the honored 
        lady, General of the People&#8217;s Army, Tsai Jing. You won&#8217;t do 
        that now. But possibly your grandfather will understand. Don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Chang was now beyond responding. He was reduced 
        to a quivering, whimpering child, just another 7 year old with all vestiges 
        of the math king he once was now gone. He contemplated mediocrity and 
        a shamed family.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Lin Xue was &#8220;on-a-roll,&#8221; and she was 
        preparing her next &#8220;reassurance&#8221; for Chang when Madam Wu returned 
        to the room. She quickly leaned back and reverted to the proper head-bowed, 
        eyes closed position. Chang&#8217;s tears were soaking his neat white 
        shirt.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Madam Wu stood erect in front of the class for 
        a seeming eternity, saying nothing and scowling that unique Chinese &#8220;warlord&#8221; 
        scowl of rebuke and disdain, alternately at the class and then piercingly 
        at Chang. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> She said, &#8220;So Chang Wei has disgraced himself. 
        Look at him. Where is his pride? Where is his honor? He now knows that 
        even he, as good a student as he might be, can err. What shall we do with 
        him? Shall we forgive him? Has he learned to avoid the arrogance of false 
        brilliance?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> As the class hour was drawing to a close, she 
        changed the subject. &#8220;It&#8217;s time to elect the team captain 
        for our class trip to the National Primary Mathematics Competition in 
        Shanghai. As usual we will do this by free democratic vote in accordance 
        with Party rules. I nominate Chang Wei, and nominations are closed. I 
        strongly suggest that everyone vote for Chang Wei.&#8221; Everybody voted 
        for him including Lin Xue.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Chang Wei looked up, wiped a tear from his eye, 
        and thought, &#8220;My mother was right. Something very good did happen 
        today.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Madam Wu then announced, &#8220;As usual, before 
        dismissal we&#8217;ll all stand and sing our school song.&#8221; She commanded, 
        &#8220;Stand up.&#8221; All immediately stood. She moved to a small upright 
        piano in the corner of the room and struck the beginning chord. Then she 
        directed the proud, respectful, class in their reverent refrain:</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><em><br>
        &#8220;The mathematics of Chairman Mao shall lead<br>
        The Zhangtse team to greater deeds<br>
        Our red banner flying proudly above <br>
        Proclaims the People&#8217;s Party we all love<br>
        Our nation will overcome enemies all<br>
        As the Zhangtse students answer the call.&#8221;</em></font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
        As Chang Wei and Lin Xue left the classroom, he sidled up to his now rather 
        downcast friend and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Lin Xue. Maybe someday 
        you&#8217;ll be chosen to lead a competition team..... maybe at some local 
        competition. Only the best can lead at Shanghai!&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> ***************************************** <br>
        <br>
        The Cultural Revolution, which began in 1966, destroyed the educational 
        system in Communist China for a period of time. But in 1968 when Chang 
        Wei was seven years old the effects had not yet been felt at the Zhangtse 
        Province School. Sadly, the interruption prevented his team from going 
        to the Shanghai competition, which was summarily canceled.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> When the elementary school was closed, Chang&#8217;s 
        mother secretly tutored both Chang Wei and Lin Xue in the evenings after 
        her chores on a communal farm.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Madam Wu, who had an English education, also fell 
        victim to the Cultural Revolution when Red Guards accused her of introducing 
        &#8220;erroneous&#8221; western methods of mathematics to her pupils, 
        and they severely beat her publicly outside the closed school. The attack 
        left her brain damaged, and she ultimately ended in a hospital for the 
        mentally ill. However, little is known about her later fate. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> In 1976 Chairman Mao Zedong died at the age of 
        82. At the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1977 universities became 
        more open to students. Lin Xue was very excited about this change because 
        her dream had always been to attend the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 
        Beijing and become a college professor. Only 28 years old in 1989 she 
        was already one of their most outstanding math professors. She suffered 
        a period of despondency when one of her most promising students was killed 
        in the Tiananmen Square demonstration. But she loved mathematics so much 
        that she moved on and continued to inspire her talented students.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> At the age of thirty Wang Tao left a farming job, 
        moved to the city, and was hired to work at the first McDonald&#8217;s 
        Restaurant, which opened in 1991 in Beijing. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Tsai Ying, General of the People&#8217;s Army, 
        who had the perfect academic record that Chang was trying to exceed, was 
        denounced and accused of collaborating with the &#8220;Gang of Four, &#8220; 
        who were trying to seize power after Mao&#8217;s death. She was tried, 
        found guilty, and sentenced to life in prison, where she died.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Our Hero, Chang Wei, continued to develop his 
        mathematics skills under his mother&#8217;s tutelage and developed them 
        further as the schools reopened. With the measured normalization of relations 
        between the US and the People&#8217;s Republic, he was able to get a visa 
        and travel to Boston with a full scholarship to Harvard. After receiving 
        his Ph.D. in mathematics he became a professor at UCLA and earned international 
        fame for being able to solve the most difficult and arcane mathematical 
        conundrums. He was ultimately able to earn US citizenship. He planned 
        to attend the 2008 Summer Olympics at Beijing to renew his relationship 
        with Lin Xue, place memorial wreaths on the graves of his very supporting 
        and loving parents, and seek information about his teacher he so respected, 
        Madam Wu.</font><br>
