    <td rowspan="28" align="left" valign="top"><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Story" --><font color="#FFFFFF">The 
      Zastrozan airship, Tannhauser, flew slowly above thin clouds and rolling 
      landscape far below. Black smoke poured from two smoke stacks as four large 
      engines propelled the craft forward. Inside and on deck, the crew went about 
      daily rounds and activities: mopping the decks or maintaining the many cannons 
      and Gatling guns that were Tannhauser&#8217;s defense and offense. 
      <p> In the bridge, the captain and first mate, denoted by golden epaulettes, 
        stood looking over the map of Zastroza and her neighboring countries</p>
      </font> 
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I disagree,&#8221; the woman, the first 
        mate, began. &#8220;Captain, with your choice to go through the Targeeran 
        Straits, the winds are rough and you know as well as I, pirates truly 
        rule those skies. Where there are unmoving clouds as thick as those, pirates 
        can come and go as they please.&#8221; The woman was frowning as she spoke, 
        tapping on the map before standing up and brushing the hair from her left 
        eye to reveal a polished metal and red cloth eye-patch. Her mind suddenly 
        dove back into her past, to a final battle between her and her brother, 
        and it was there, where her brother stole her eye and forced the eye patch 
        upon her.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I think the ship can handle herself, and 
        pirates wouldn&#8217;t dare attack a Zastrozan cruiser! Besides, we both 
        know what she can do.&#8221; The captain smirked self-assuredly and rubbed 
        his black and grey beard. She looked down at him, more than a head taller. 
        &#8220;Besides, my route is four days faster. Relax, commander Baumont&eacute;.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;But Captain Mahley-&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Quiet. We&#8217;ll be fine. Trust me.&#8221; 
        The captain grinned, turned, and walked to the helmsman. &#8220;45 Degrees 
        port, and head for the straits.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
        Commander Baumont&eacute; sat upright in a chair on the darkened bridge, 
        a vanilla-scented cigarillo burning slowly between her lips. She scanned 
        the cloud banks ahead of the ship she was under the command of, frowning 
        some. The thought of pirates, who hid in clouds, still lingered in her 
        mind. She knew that, whether it was needed or not, there was no help around.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Commander, the straits are just ahead. 
        We have about 5 minutes before we enter, and another fifteen to twenty, 
        at full steam, to travel through completely,&#8221; the helmsman said, 
        sitting in front of her. The red lights shown brightly on the first mate 
        as she nodded. She drew a long drag from the cigarillo and blew it up 
        into the air. Her free hand dropped to hold the ruby handle of her service 
        revolver and her lips pulled downward into a frown. She closed her eye 
        and her mind drifted to the ceremony where the pistol was bequeathed to 
        her by the Admiral of the Sky Navy, upon her graduation to rank of Commander. 
        The woman almost felt the handshake of the Admiral, and the firm pat on 
        her back.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Maybe the captain was right,&#8221; the 
        first mate thought, frowning as she puffed on the vanilla-scented cigarillo 
        as the red light cast onto her face. &#8220;Maybe, though safe, my route 
        was a waste.&#8221; The woman tipped her head back as she inhaled before 
        blowing a smoke ring into the air. She watched it as it slowly dissipated 
        and frowned.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Commander, we are entering the Strait,&#8221; 
        the helmsman said, breaking into her reverie.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> In the shadows of the thick, impenetrable clouds, 
        something moved slowly, matching speed with the oncoming Cruiser. The 
        Tannhauser shined in the night, spotlights scanning over the cloudwall. 
        Guards slowly trolled the deck, watching for pirates that seemed to always 
        lurk just out of sight.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> A soft pop sounded in the distance, then a whistle, 
        barely audible on the wind, and then nothing. The moon watched as the 
        Tannhauser steamed forward unmolested. On the bridge, the first mate frowned 
        and dabbed out the cigarillo only to light another from her black cigarillo 
        case. She brushed her thumb over it and sighed, remembering her father&#8217;s 
        face as he gave her the gun before she left. She recalled his green eyes 
        looking into hers before they parted. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> There would be more time to remember such things 
        later, though.. The woman raised a matching lighter and lit the cigarillo 
        before blowing a puff into the air. Her stony, grey eye scanned to her 
        left, and to her right. She strained to hear a pop, off in the distance, 
        before her eye widened.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> And an explosion rocked the ship, sending the 
        woman out of her chair and stumbling forward.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Red alert! Quickly, sound the alarm!&#8221; 
        She ordered. In seconds, bells and claxons were ringing, and the crews 
        sprung into action. Two large pirate ships emerged from the clouds, large 
        ironclad galleons, each baring a light blue flag. Their cannons were raised, 
        ready for action. The captain burst into the bridge of the Tannhauser.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Giada, what&#8217;s going on&#8230;&#8221; 
        his voice trailed off as he caught sight of the two pirate ships: the 
        Lady Margeaux to port and the Savant, starboard.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;This is your fault captain. Pirates, as 
        you can see, are attacking.&#8221; The first mate, Giada Baumont&eacute;, 
        said calmly, speaking around the cigarillo as a ghost of grey smoke fluttered 
        in the air from the glowing tip.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; The man said, sinking 
        into the chair.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re free to think whatever 
        you want,&#8221; she pulled the cigarillo from her mouth and spat into 
        a copper spittoon, scowling some. Another rumble, from the ship to the 
        left and an explosion rocked the ship. It groaned as the armor held together 
        but buckled in places. &#8220;All cannons, fire at will!&#8221; The woman 
        yelled, and a different alarm went off to signal firing. A rumble from 
        both sides of the ship resounded from a broadside volley, 20 guns in all, 
        and then explosions as they came into contact with pirate vessels. The 
        captain, in the bridge, groaned and rubbed his face as he sat. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I told you this would happen, Capt-&#8221; 
        An explosion rocked the ship from both the Galleons&#8217; broadsides. 
        The Tannhauser began to list to the side and forward. The other officers 
        braced themselves as the first mate leaned some, and then put her foot 
        up on the back of the helmsman&#8217;s chair to brace herself as the ship 
        listed forward enough she couldn&#8217;t stand up straight without assistance. 
        &#8220;Drop bow main ballast, seventeen-hundred pounds, and drop port 
        main ballast by eight-hundred. All ahead full!&#8221; The two crew members 
        near the helmsman pulled levers and water from the ballast tanks emptied 
        out. Another volley of pops echoed on the bridge as the Zastrozan airship 
        returned fire.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Commander, we&#8217;re almost half way 
        through the Strait.&#8221; The helmsman said.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;And the damage report,&#8221; the commander 
        asked as she watched a white-suited enginner walk in with a piece of notation 
        paper and then quickly run out, only making eye contact with her for a 
        scant second.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Commander, we&#8217;ve sustained minimum 
        damage to the hull. Engine output it down by ten percent. No breaches 
        into secondary hulls. There is a small deck fire, but crew is taking care 
        of that.&#8221; The engineer said. No one made mention that the captain 
        had disappeared. As the Tannhauser regained stability, the first mate 
        heard a hail of pops from the enemy ships fired. She cringed, her face 
        losing its color as thousands of little pings resounded through the armored 
        bridge. The pirate ships fired grapeshot, wiping out the crewmen on the 
        deck that were putting out the fire. Giada was glad she couldn&#8217;t 
        see down onto the deck from where she stood.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Load heavy-yield shells in the main cannons 
        and fire broadsides on the port ship,&#8221; the woman ordered as she 
        leaned back against the map table. The order was given with a series of 
        bells and chimes from the engineer. She took a long drag from the cigarillo 
        as 13 large cannons fired. After a secondary boom, a large explosion rocked 
        even the Tannhauser as the heavy-yield shells exploded inside the armor-clad 
        galleon to the cruiser&#8217;s left. Chunks of metal began to fall from 
        the ship to the dark, unknown landscape below. A second volley from the 
        cruiser was the killing blow, and the ship exploded as the high pressure 
        boilers exploded in the ship.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
        Meanwhile, above the Tannhauser, a smaller airship hovered above the rear 
        deck. A small group of pirates rappelled onto the deck and immediately 
        slipped inside. Quickly, they forced down any crewmembers in their way 
        as they pushed for the Captain&#8217;s room. There, the captain sat, a 
        pistol pointed toward the door of this cabin. The pirates looked surprised 
        when they stood there at gunpoint.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Well, well, well&#8230;Mahley, what a gorgeous 
        ship you brought me,&#8221; the lead pirate said, grinning.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Only if you live up to your side of the 
        deal, Ignatio. Gold, and a free home,&#8221; the Captain responded, not 
        lowering the gun. Above him, outside the cruiser, the 13 guns fired their 
        first volley. &#8220;I&#8217;m assuming you have some airship waiting?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Ignatio smiled disarmingly. 
        &#8220;It&#8217;s on the starboard side, as your subordinates are quite 
        in the dark as to your plan. I&#8217;m sure they have no real idea, but 
        they do make quite a racket.&#8221; The pirate wore a plain blue coat 
        and brown leather britches. His hair was platinum white and flowing toward 
        his shoulders and his eyes a shimmering, almost lavender blue.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I&#8217;ll follow you guys. Lemme grab 
        the stuff from the safe.&#8221; As the captain spoke, the rest of the 
        group left the pirate leader and two others, killing people as they come.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
        The ashtray beside Giada Baumont&eacute;, first mate of the Tannhauser, 
        had two dying chunks of cigarillo in them, and one still burning slowly. 
        A fourth was beginning to yearn to join them, perched between the woman&#8217;s 
        lips.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Where is the captain?&#8221; Someone asked. 
        Giada didn&#8217;t know who. It didn&#8217;t matter, the captain was gone.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;He must&#8217;ve fled to his quarters. 
        I&#8217;m acting captain. How much longer until we clear the Straits,&#8221; 
        she asked, blowing smoke into the air.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I estimate we have around seven minutes, 
        Commander,&#8221; the Helmsman replied. &#8220;If we take damage to the 
        engines, you can double that, and we may be able to limp to a Zastrozan 
        Flying Fortress.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; the first mate said, 
        dabbing out a fourth cigarillo. Her lips were pulled down in a frown. 
        She turned her head and looked down the hall from the bridge. A bloodied 
        officer was limping toward her.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;C-commander&#8230;We&#8230;were boarded.&#8221; 
        He groaned and fell at the steps leading up to the bridge, and Giada hurried 
        to hear him and help him. &#8220;Pirates&#8230;couldn&#8217;t fight t-them 
        off.&#8221; The man winced, a trickle of blood falling from the right 
        corner of his mouth and nose. &#8220;W-we must&#8230;ab-abandon ship.&#8221; 
        With those final words, the man gasped and fell over the bottom step. 
        The commander made her way back up the stairs.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I&#8217;ve just received information that 
        we&#8217;ve been boarded. Ladies and gentlemen, prepare your side-arms. 
        It&#8217;s going to get rough.&#8221; The woman lit another cigarillo 
        and drew her ruby-handled service revolver. As Giada placed the cigarello 
        between her lips she flicked out the cylinder, made sure it was well loaded, 
        then flicked it close and gave it a spin. Her grey eye scanned the bridge 
        before stopping on the navigator, a young woman whose name the First Mate 
        never bothered learning. &#8220;Draw your gun, you&#8217;re coming with 
        me. And lock up after we leave, we can&#8217;t allow them to take the 
        bridge.&#8221; She turned and made her way back down the steps with the 
        navigator in toe, a pistol in her own hand. Above and behind them the 
        heavy metal door clanked shut and locked. The grey eye of the Zastrozan 
        commander scanned the hall way in front of her and she made her way along 
        it, pistol raised.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> A pirate, clad in light blue, turned the corner 
        before the first mate did. The two stood, staring at one another, before 
        the Commander shot. The bullet pierced skin and bone, directly into the 
        man&#8217;s heart. He crumbled into the corner with a slight, airy groan. 
        The woman stepped over him, puffing on the cigarillo and leaving a slight 
        trail of smoke and vanilla.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;C-commander, where are you going?&#8221; 
        The navigator asked.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I&#8217;m going to get the captain.&#8221; 
        The woman replied firmly as the two made their way down the corridor. 
        Another blast rocked the ship. Alarm bells rang along the halls. &#8220;The 
        captain&#8217;s room is just up here.&#8221; She took a long drag and 
        blew the smoke out of her nostrils. There was a yell from the captain&#8217;s 
        quarters and then a familiar young man walked out. Giada Baumont&eacute; 
        immediately recognized the pirate.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Ignatio Fieronze. So nice to see you again,&#8221; 
        the woman said as she aimed at him.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Ah&#8230;Dear sister.&#8221; He smiled. 
        &#8220;What is it you go by now? Baumont&eacute;, is it? You do your heritage 
        such disgrace. I see you have a nice shiny eye patch.&#8221; The woman 
        fired to his side, a warning shot. Down the hall, two more pirates slowly 
        walked forward, toward the back of their leader. &#8220;I also see&#8230;that 
        you&#8217;re losing this battle too. Tsk tsk tsk. I wish you would bite 
        the bullet and win one for the family.&#8221; The woman growled, shifting 
        her stance and firing down the hall, past his head, into the head of one 
        of the other pirates. The body fell to the ground.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I&#8217;m only going to ask you once. What 
        have you done to the captain?&#8221; The woman asked and the pirate only 
        shrugged and leaned against the wall. An explosion rocked the ship and 
        lights dimmed and flashed. The other pirate, down the hall, was almost 
        right behind Ignatio, and standing with his gun ready.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I just gave him what he asked for&#8230;a 
        free home and gold.&#8221; The woman raised her eyebrow and her eye widened 
        before she fired again, this time killing the other man behind the pirate 
        leader, who in turn, quickly drew his own revolver and dropped to a crouch. 
        After a sinister sounding blast, the Navigator, after hiding behind the 
        commander, fell with a whimper and a groan. Giada sneered, her aim returning 
        to the pirate leader. He smirked and then rolled into the hallway across 
        from the Captain&#8217;s quarters. His sister couldn&#8217;t tell, but 
        he stood and quickly ran down the hallway.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;What the-?&#8221; Commander Baumont&eacute; 
        cursed and gave chase, her pistol at the ready. And there she saw him 
        at the end of the hallway. The woman aimed and fired a single shot at 
        her brother &#8211; at the pirate that had once been her brother.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> As the bullet met skin and bone and flesh, the 
        galleon that was remaining to the ships starboard side, fired a final 
        volley. Piercing the double-armored-hull of the Tannhauser, the ship rocked 
        with a thunderous explosion that ignited the coal stores. Fire ran through 
        the ship as it exploded, engulfing anything and everything indiscriminately 
        &#8211; pirate or officer. A second explosion rocked the ship as the boilers 
        ruptured and exploded. The Zastrozan Airship Tannhauser blew up, breaking 
        into pieces and falling toward the ground far below.</font><br>
