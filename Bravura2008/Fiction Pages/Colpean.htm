    <td rowspan="28" align="left" valign="top"><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Story" --><font color="#FFFFFF">Mickey 
      sat alone studying everyone else at the party. He wasn&#8217;t a wild person. 
      As he picked at the chair&#8217;s fabric while everyone else drank and cursed 
      and made out he thought about how he didn&#8217;t go to the party to rebel 
      against his mother. He was just sick of doing nothing at all. Mickey focused 
      on a certain girl who danced around like an Indian as her loose-fitting 
      dress swung violently against her legs. Her stringy black hair and pale 
      skin worked off each other like a yin-yang, except her hair seemed to spread 
      across her face like it was taking over. While she danced around, she knocked 
      into anything that was in her way, almost in a deliberate hostility. 
      </font><font color="#000000"><p><font color="#FFFFFF">He must have stared for too long because she began to look over at him, 
        and every time she did, he turned away. Then he realized that whenever 
        their eyes met, she&#8217;d smile at him. This may be what he was looking 
        for. Mickey half got up from the chair to talk to her, but without really 
        wanting to, he sat back down again. He had never approached a girl before 
        and didn&#8217;t know how it was done, but he definitely thought that 
        she was the type of girl he could spend his life with&#8212;she had noticed 
        him. Mickey hung his head and tapped his fingers against his knees. He 
        decided that he&#8217;d just stay where he was but then he heard, &#8220;Hey 
        there.&#8221; It was a raspy, but feminine voice. Mickey looked up and 
        the girl in the dress was standing next to him with one arm propped against 
        a wall. &#8220;You look like you need to have some fun.&#8221; He glanced 
        behind him and no one was there; she was definitely talking to him.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Before Mickey could say anything back, her slender hands wrapped around 
        his arm and she began pulling him through the room and then to the front 
        yard where they were alone.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Needed some fresh air?&#8221; Mickey said looking for a safe conversation.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I really doubt that this air is fresh. Just because this is the 
        yuppie part of town doesn&#8217;t mean that the air isn&#8217;t polluted.&#8221; 
        The girl let go of Mickey&#8217;s arm and picked up a rock much larger 
        than her fist.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Watch this.&#8221; She cocked her arm back and aimed it toward 
        one of the house&#8217;s floor to ceiling windows.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Wait! What are you doing?&#8221; Mickey waved his arms and took 
        a step toward her.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;What does it look like I&#8217;m doing? I&#8217;m going to break 
        that fucking window.&#8221; She paused and looked at Mickey up and down. 
        &#8220;Or maybe you should. My guess is that you&#8217;ve never destroyed 
        anything on purpose, have you?&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;No, no I haven&#8217;t and I don&#8217;t ever plan to.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Come on, just throw one little rock. I&#8217;ll even find a smaller 
        one.&#8221; The girl said, but Mickey had had enough. As she looked for 
        a new rock he quickly began walking toward his car and hoped that she 
        wouldn&#8217;t follow him.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I knew I shouldn&#8217;t have gone to this party.&#8221; He said 
        aloud to himself as he got into his Toyota Hybrid and sped off. Mickey 
        looked into his rearview mirror and saw that she was passing the rock 
        from hand to hand while watching him leave. What a nut case, he thought. 
        He didn&#8217;t think about anything else during remainder of the ride. 
        He only listened to Smooth Jazz 98.7 until he got back to his apartment 
        where he lived alone.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">He stepped inside and flipped on the light switch revealing his completely 
        white walls. His only decoration was in the kitchen, which was a sign 
        that read, &#8220;We live in this world, but are not of this world.&#8221; 
        The counters didn&#8217;t have a single crumb on them because Mickey once 
        saw a TV special on bacteria and how it invades everything. Every night 
        he did what the program advised him to do and bleached everything down 
        making sure not to miss a spot. Directly after cleaning the kitchen he 
        made sure his door was secured and then he changed into his pajamas. He&#8217;d 
        fold his dirty clothes and place them neatly into his hamper. In the morning 
        he&#8217;d cook up some eggs, well done, and watch an episode of Full 
        House on his DVD player. He liked to start his day off with a little wholesome 
        comedy.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">It was a week after the party, while Mickey was halfway into a Full House 
        episode, when he heard the phone ring. He was afraid that it was his mother. 
        He was certain that she&#8217;d ask him to describe everywhere he went 
        and what he had done in detail, just to make sure he was staying out of 
        trouble, and he couldn&#8217;t tell her about his party experience. But 
        he also couldn&#8217;t lie to her so he had been screening his calls until 
        enough time passed to where she might forget to ask.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">He looked at his caller I.D. and didn&#8217;t recognize the number so 
        he slowly picked it up.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Hello?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Hey there! You don&#8217;t know my name, but we met at the party 
        the other day. I&#8217;m Ana.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Mickey dropped his fork into his eggs and thought about hanging up, but 
        he wondered how she managed to find him.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I swear I&#8217;m not a stalker or anything. I got your number 
        through my friend who&#8217;s in your Organic Chemistry discussion group. 
        I was describing you to her and she knew exactly who I was talking about.&#8221; 
        Mickey knew what she meant. He was the only student at the college who 
        wore a full suit to class each day. Not even the teachers wore suits so 
        nicely pressed and creased like Mickey&#8217;s.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I just wanted to say sorry if I startled you. I should have known 
        that you weren&#8217;t ready for something like that yet.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Like what?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I&#8217;d like to make it up to you. Why don&#8217;t you come 
        over to my place and we can listen to music.&#8221; Mickey hesitated to 
        answer.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Yeah, ok, that sounds nice.&#8221; He figured that she must have 
        really found him attractive since she managed to track him down, and although 
        she seemed oddly wild, he was stuck on the fact that she seemed interested 
        in him. &#8220;You mean right now?&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Right now is great. What&#8217;s your name?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;It&#8217;s Mickey, thanks for asking.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Mickey was always taught to say things like &#8220;Thanks for asking.&#8221; 
        He was home schooled his entire life and his mother always taught him 
        to be a respectful young man. She also instructed him to avoid the hazards 
        of the nonsensical world at all costs. They went over math and science 
        and all that, but she&#8217;d always refer back to a simple lesson, &#8220;We 
        are from this world, but not of this world.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> When he got off the phone with Ana, he immediately prepared himself 
        by picking out his best suit, parting his hair to his good side, and spraying 
        himself with three sprays of cologne. He did all this hoping to impresses 
        her. He then drove to the address that she had given him, but by the look 
        of his surroundings, he thought that maybe she had set him up. Every other 
        house had plywood for windows and the ones that didn&#8217;t had metal 
        bars. He stopped outside of the house that her directions had led him 
        to and just about turned around until he saw her step out of the door 
        and wave to him.</font></p>
      </font>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;This is it! I&#8217;m so glad you chose 
        to come over!&#8221; She yelled.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Mickey parked his car and met Ana at her door. 
        &#8220;This is my lovely home,&#8221; She raised her middle finger aggressively 
        toward the house. &#8220;Actually, it&#8217;s my parent&#8217;s home.&#8221; 
        She muttered to herself &#8220;Fucking jerks,&#8221; and then turned to 
        the garage, &#8220;My room is in the garage though, so they never bother 
        me.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;You live in your parents&#8217; garage?&#8221; 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;It&#8217;s not as bad as you think. I don&#8217;t 
        have to pay for anything.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Well neither do I really, I mean, I pay 
        for my food, but my mother pays for the rest.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Mother, you call her mother?&#8221; She 
        said through a laugh.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Well, she likes it that way.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">He entered her doorway and saw a cluttered mess 
        of Zeppelin posters and scattered records and dirty clothes. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Just because you&#8217;re clothes are dirty 
        doesn&#8217;t mean you should throw them around,&#8221; he said as he 
        stepped over a bunched-up pile of laundry.&#8220;Yeah, ok Beaver Cleaver. 
        Nice suit by the way.&#8221; She laughed as she laid down on the floor 
        and patted her hand against the spot next to her, &#8220;Come down here, 
        have a seat.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Mickey looked at the cement ground and saw that 
        little circles of dried up gum and dust bunnies covered what her dirty 
        clothes had missed. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll just lie on the couch if 
        that&#8217;s alright.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Yeah sure, whatever works for you, but you&#8217;re 
        really missing out.&#8221; She turned on her record player and then rested 
        again on the floor. &#8220;Listen to this, this is real good shit.&#8221; 
        Screeching guitars and vocals pierced into Mickey&#8217;s ears and his 
        entire body tightened.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Ana looked at him and saw that his body language 
        protested against the music. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you hear this? It&#8217;s 
        fucking great.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I hear it, I just don&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Well it speaks to me. This is fucking music. It 
        can change a person, you know?&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">But Mickey didn&#8217;t know. In his mind, music 
        wasn&#8217;t an experience, it was a planned enjoyment. He thought about 
        his Boney James CDs and other smooth jazz albums that he had back in his 
        apartment.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;It&#8217;s just that the stuff I listen 
        to doesn&#8217;t sound so obnoxiously loud.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">She reached over and turned the player up even 
        more. &#8220;I bet you listen to easy listening shit don&#8217;t you? 
        What is it, smooth jazz?&#8221; Mickey looked at his shoes and wished 
        that he and Ana could have had a better start. He thought about how Dr. 
        Phil on TV always talked about compromise and how it is the key to a relationship. 
        If this relationship was going to work, they&#8217;d have to find compromise.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Come on,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you have 
        to start somewhere and it might as well be with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs&#8221; 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Tick blasted from the speakers as she crossed her 
        legs Indian style and stretched her arms out like she was receiving some 
        sort of frequency that he couldn't pick up.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Well this isn&#8217;t my preference, but 
        perhaps we can find something that we can both agree on.&#8221; Mickey 
        thought his suggestion was just.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Pfff, yeah, I&#8217;m sure that will work. 
        Mickey, I guarantee you that this music will set you free if you just 
        listen to it.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> They went on like this for weeks. He would come 
        over and listen to her music and every day it was a new band: The Doors, 
        The Pixies, Kings of Leon, The Velvet Underground, anything loud really. 
        Ana called it music treatment. Sometimes he suggested that they go to 
        a fancy restaurant, his treat, but she&#8217;d always laugh and tell him 
        that she was fine right where she was. He realized that all they ever 
        really did was listen to music and talk about music, so he got the idea 
        to ask about her family one day, just to get to know her more.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;My family? Fucking nut cases, that&#8217;s 
        what they are. When I was a kid they&#8217;d make fun of me constantly. 
        Whenever they started up I&#8217;d hide under our coffee table and after 
        an hour or so they&#8217;d get bored. And fuck them for it. I never got 
        anything out of them so I moved in here, you know, just until I find another 
        place or something.&#8221; She picked up a CD case and threw it against 
        the wall and then looked at Mickey. &#8220;It always feels great to do 
        that. You should really try destroying something one of these days.&#8221; 
        He bent over to pick up the shattered pieces of plastic.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;This can be dangerous Ana.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;You&#8217;re such a square, I&#8217;m going 
        to get through to you though, I will.&#8221; She narrowed her eyes, &#8220;What 
        about your parents? I bet your mom raised you.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;She taught me everything I know, and I 
        appreciate her. She let me move away, but sometimes I think she&#8217;s 
        still living with me. I mean, she calls me every day of the week.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;And doesn&#8217;t that make you angry?&#8221; 
        Ana handed him another CD case. &#8220;Smash it man. Pretend you&#8217;re 
        throwing it at her face.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t. I&#8217;d just have 
        to clean it up.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> She sighed. &#8220;I&#8217;m just not making much 
        progress with you.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> She got up from the ground and sat next to him. 
        So close that Mickey felt uncomfortable.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;To cause shit, you have to be shit,&#8221; 
        she told him as she placed her hand on his knee. She always said things 
        like that. She liked saying that Sergeant Pepper made her do things, and 
        she told him to say the same.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">He didn&#8217;t know how to respond to her comment 
        and could feel his legs start to shake like they were begging him to run. 
        She pulled her dress up, exposing her upper thigh and smirked at Mickey 
        in a scheming way. He sort of glanced down at her legs, but felt embarrassed 
        at the same time, so he only looked in three second spurts.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">He literally counted three out in his head.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">He knew that she noticed him glancing all along, 
        but he still wanted to treat her like a lady. Twelve years of home school 
        and that&#8217;s what he learned&#8212;to act polite. And even when looking 
        at Ana&#8217;s legs, respect was just a natural reaction.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Listen Ana, I&#8217;m not ready for this.&#8221; 
        He jumped from the couch. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Ok, ok. Dammit, you&#8217;re definitely 
        the most difficult project I&#8217;ve ever taken on. How about we go out 
        instead? I can teach you how to shop lift. It&#8217;s really fucking easy. 
        I mean all you really need to watch out for . . .&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;No! I need to go home. I need to go home. 
        I need to go home.&#8221; Mickey turned around and ran. It reminded him 
        of the party. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">He got home and listened to his mother&#8217;s 
        newest message complaining about how he never picked up anymore. Mickey 
        why aren&#8217;t you answering anymore!? You better not be on some wild 
        road trip or you will be in major trouble! I&#8217;ve decided to drive 
        down there. Eight hours worth of driving so if you&#8217;re not dead or 
        very, very sick I will be so angry. . .&#8221; Mickey turned it off. He 
        ripped the answering machine from its wires and aimed it at the wall, 
        but then he put it back down on the table. He had to get out of there. 
        He thought about his mother coming and how she&#8217;d force him to tell 
        her where he&#8217;d been all these weeks. Mickey realized that it wouldn&#8217;t 
        be all that bad except he was sure that his mother would make him move 
        back in with her and then he&#8217;d never find a girl.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">He decided to go back to Ana&#8217;s, but on the 
        way he picked up some new CDs, The Talking Heads, The Bravery, and The 
        Killers, and hoped that they could help them find a middle ground.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Look who&#8217;s back already. I was afraid 
        that you would fail.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;My mom&#8217;s on her way here. I needed 
        to get out of there.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">He stepped in and he showed her the CDs. She took 
        a step back and sucked air through her clenched teeth. &#8220;I&#8217;m 
        sorry but that shit is awful. It&#8217;s just mindless pop.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Oh come on, I&#8217;m just looking for a 
        bond between us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s just try it out.&#8221; 
        He put on The Talking Heads and her entire body tightened up. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Does this music inspire you at all? Do you 
        feel it even the slightest bit?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">He knew the answer she was searching for was no, 
        but he went for something deeper. &quot;Maybe.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;No, no way. It can&#8217;t. Is this what 
        you really want? The others never took this long.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;What others? What are you even talking about?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Come on, we&#8217;re going out,&#8221; she 
        instructed.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">He thought that maybe she was going to let him 
        take her out somewhere nice. He opened the car door for her, but she didn&#8217;t 
        get in.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;No, I&#8217;m going to drive. I&#8217;m 
        the one who knows where we&#8217;re going.&#8221; She grabbed the keys 
        and he got into the passenger side. She put in The Velvet Underground 
        CD, a band that Mickey couldn&#8217;t stand, and as they drove he thought 
        about what he wanted to say. It took him a good five minutes to formulate 
        his words and at that point they were well on their way to wherever Ana 
        was taking him. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;A relationship&#8217;s about cooperation 
        you know. If we want this to work out we need to find some sort of union. 
        I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re too different, we just need to work together.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;What the fuck Mickey? That&#8217;s not even 
        the point of all this.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Well, then what is? Frick.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Fuck.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;What?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Say &#8216;fuck&#8217;&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;You&#8217;re completely insane. What does 
        it even matter? Fucking head case.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">She smiled. &#8220;Now you&#8217;re a big boy.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Ana quickly pulled off the road and into a field. 
        </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Why are we stopping here?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;We&#8217;re going to screw and we&#8217;re 
        going to do it right here in this dirty field.&#8221; She got out and 
        opened his door. &#8220;Come on, get out. This is for your own good. I 
        could tell from the moment I saw you that you were perfect for me.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Really?&#8221; Mickey thought that maybe 
        she would finally see things correctly. &#8220;Ana, I would just love 
        to grow old together.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Grow old together? Yeah that&#8217;s what 
        you want, I&#8217;m sure. Or did you get that idea from your mother? Grow 
        old, for fuck&#8217;s sake. You were perfect for me because I knew you 
        needed to see what the world is really like. I&#8217;m going to live in 
        this dump forever, this polluted shit hole. It&#8217;s full of jerks and 
        empty buildings. And you&#8217;ll realize that even if it&#8217;s with 
        you kicking and screaming. Even if I have to rape you. I do this to squares 
        like you all the time.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Mickey&#8217;s fists clenched as she spoke. He 
        forced air in and out of his mouth with an audible force.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;That&#8217;s it. I can see the resentment 
        inside of you. You&#8217;re shit, so cause some shit.&#8221; She handed 
        him a rock from the ground.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Mickey grasped onto it and smashed it against the 
        car window. He watched the glass shatter and admired its destruction. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The rioting music pushed its way out into the nighttime 
        air as Ana laid down in the field and spread her legs.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Come to me.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Mickey looked at the broken glass again and then 
        dropped beside her in the dirt and itchy weeds. If he was just some sort 
        of project for her, then Mickey decided to see where it would lead him. 
        He had already broken his window.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">She jumped on top of him and he imagined that they 
        were on his mother&#8217;s yard. In his mind she&#8217;d catch them and 
        would scream, &#8220;Oh heaven mercy!&#8221; and would tell him that he 
        was sort of wild child anarchist. He thought about how he spent his first 
        18 years of life in a square room learning only what his mother wanted 
        him to know.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">They finished and Ana looked into Mickey&#8217;s 
        eyes.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;This is the other side Mickey. You&#8217;ve 
        finally learned.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Then Mickey wondered how Ana&#8217;s room was any 
        different from his mother&#8217;s room.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">He moved a few feet away from Ana. He sat Indian 
        style on the dirt and stretched his arms out while European Son revolted 
        from the speakers, but it could have been anything really. Smooth jazz, 
        The Killers, Led Zeppelin, it really could have been anything. He heard 
        it all.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;What ever made you think I wanted to learn 
        another lesson?&#8221; He picked up another rock and threw it toward his 
        car, but this time with less aggression.</font><br>
