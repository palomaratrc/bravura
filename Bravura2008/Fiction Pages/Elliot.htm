      Jimmy!&#8221; my mother called out. She stepped into the bedroom wiping 
      her hands on the dishtowel that she seemed to always be carrying with her. 
      &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you hear me calling you?&#8221; </font>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I&#8217;m 
        almost done.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> In one moment my stood in the doorway and the 
        in next she was beside me and snatched the comic book out of my hand. 
        &#8220;You&#8217;re done now. And take your feet off the bed.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Ah, mom,&#8221; I said as my lifeless arms 
        fell to my side. I spun my feet around and placed them on the ground. 
        &#8220;Dang, it was just getting good. You see Spider-Man just saved this 
        girl from falling out a window and when he brought her down to the street, 
        bam, the Scorpion attacked him.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;That&#8217;s nice. I need you to run some 
        deliveries.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Aw, do I have to?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Her answer was to place her hands on her hips. 
        Her eyes narrowed and her lips drew tight and fixed me with a stare that 
        told me she was in no mood to bargain. &#8220;What year is this?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Uh, 1969?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;That&#8217;s right and if you would like 
        to see 1970, you better do as I ask.&#8221; Her face softened. &#8220;Jimmy, 
        you know how your father is. I have to get dinner finished and I really 
        need you to get these orders delivered and get back here before your father 
        comes home.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Yes ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">My mom stayed at home, but to add to pop&#8217;s 
        income she sold Avon door-to-door. My brother and sister and I were sworn 
        to secrecy that pop would never know she had this business. It would mean 
        that he couldn&#8217;t take care of his family. So my mom took orders 
        from the women who lived in all the apartment buildings that ran the length 
        of the block we lived on. After pop left for work, my mom carried around 
        the blue fabric sample case that was filled with vials, salves, potions 
        and other artifacts of girly voodoo magic. When their orders came in my 
        brother, sister and I helped her sort out the merchandise into little 
        pink and white bags and stapled the receipts to the bags. My mom collected 
        all those dainty little bags and placed them into larger shopping bag 
        that boldly announced in large gold script, underlined with a pink ribbon 
        that formed the exclamation point for the words, Avon Calling! </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The first two deliveries were on the same floor 
        and thankfully Mrs. Kurtz and Mrs. Hernandez were both home and they paid 
        me with exact change. The next two deliveries were in my friend Richard 
        Sweringer&#8217;s building. Richard was downstairs when I came by and 
        he gave me his typical hangdog nod. Normally, there were two things I 
        dreaded being caught carrying in public, one was any product with the 
        word feminine on it, and the other was the &#8220;Avon Calling!&#8221; 
        bag, but being seen by Richard was okay. His mother once made him wear 
        lederhosen to school for a week; he was now member-in-good-standing of 
        the all-losers club. Seeing me carrying the Avon bag made him seem less 
        pathetic, so he helped me make the next few deliveries. Mrs. Valentine, 
        Mrs. Del Torre and Mrs. Swann gave us each a tip for being prompt with 
        their deliveries. Richard couldn&#8217;t wait to spend his loot and took 
        off the Rexall to buy some candy. I had one last delivery and that was 
        for Mrs. Henry who lived on the top floor of the last building at the 
        end of the block.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I knocked on her door and waited for someone to 
        answer. A voice small and cautious came from the other side of the door. 
        &#8220;Yes? Who are you? What do you want?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Uh, Avon?&#8221; I answered.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Excuse me?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Avon. I have an Avon delivery for you, Miss 
        Henry,&#8221; I answered. I tried to keep my voice low just in case anyone 
        I knew was lurking about.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you. You&#8217;re 
        not the Avon lady.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I am, I mean I&#8217;m not, but my mom&#8217;s 
        a lady, I mean she&#8217;s my mom, but&#8230;I&#8217;m just dropping off 
        your order.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The door opened timidly and a face like a relief 
        map peered out. She gave me the once over with her deep-set blue eyes 
        and then opened the door wide. Her voice changed, becoming lighter and 
        energetic. &#8220;Come in, come in.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Thanks, that&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;m just 
        here to drop off your order.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I know, but you want get paid don&#8217;t 
        you?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Well, yeah.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll have to come in while 
        I look for my purse.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I came in and she directed me to sit on the sofa. 
        Her apartment was laid out just like the one my family lived in, except 
        less cluttered, a lot quieter and the furniture was covered with knitted 
        doilies that were on all the arm rests. The air in the living room was 
        still and dry; as if she hadn&#8217;t opened a window in years. She excused 
        herself as she went to the back room and I sat stiffly on the sofa, not 
        wanting to mess anything up. On the coffee table next to this week&#8217;s 
        TV Guide was a small box decorated with buttons. Every surface, even the 
        bottom had a dozen or so buttons glued to it. When Mrs. Henry reappeared 
        I pointed to the box and asked, &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;That&#8217;s my button collection,&#8221; 
        she answered. &#8220;Do you collect anything?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Yeah, I collect comic books.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Really, which ones?&#8221; She recognized 
        the names of Superman and Batman, but not Spider-Man.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Do you want to see my buttons?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Yeah, sure.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Mrs. Henry opened the little box. &#8220;Pull out 
        any button and I&#8217;ll tell you something about it.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I reached in and pulled out a button covered with 
        a white cloth material &#8220;That&#8217;s an easy one. That button is 
        from my wedding dress. I was married in 1918 and my dress had 64 buttons 
        just like this one that ran down the back. It took half an hour to button 
        it up,&#8221; She chuckled and added, &#8220;But only five minutes to 
        unbutton it.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I didn&#8217;t get the joke.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;How about his one?&#8221; I said holding 
        up dull green one.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;That one is from Frank&#8217;s uniform. 
        He was in the army during World War One. He was wounded and won a Purple 
        Heart.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Dang, a Purple Heart? World War One, how 
        long ago was that?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> She laughed, &#8220;Let me tell you it seems like 
        a life time ago, but it has really been only 50 years. Wait a minute,&#8221; 
        she said interrupting her own thoughts. &#8220;If you think that one was 
        old, you&#8217;ll love this one.&#8221; She rummaged around the box until 
        she pulled out a tarnished gold button. &#8220;This one came from the 
        uniform of my grandfather. He fought in the Civil War.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;No lie?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> She crossed her heart. &#8220;No lie. He was killed 
        in one of the last battles, too. The war was declared over, but I guess 
        no one told the other side, yet.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">We went through her collections. She had a button 
        from old boyfriends, from her mother&#8217;s favorite summer dress, the 
        overalls her father wore, her two other husbands, and her children. One 
        of her sons was killed on Okinawa in World War Two, and her only daughter, 
        Alice, was a supply clerk during the Korean War, she died in plane crash 
        the on her way home from the war.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Your family has been through a lot of wars, 
        Mrs. Henry.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">She turned her attention away from the collection 
        and looked at me. &#8220;I have a grandson just a few years older than 
        you. I worry about him. He could end up getting drafted for this Viet 
        Nam War.&#8221; I thought about that for a moment. My brother was almost 
        four years older than me. In a few years he could be drafted, too. I wondered 
        how it would feel if all I had to remember my brother was a button.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">We chatted on until I realized I was supposed to 
        be home a half-hour ago. &#8220;Oh shoot, I&#8217;m going to get creamed.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I left her package and bolted out the door. When 
        I got home my father was already sitting at the kitchen table along with 
        brothers and sister. My mom was standing up serving.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Where were you?&#8221; Pop growled.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I looked quickly up at my mother who evaded my 
        eyes, I was on my own. &#8220;Uh, I was with Richard Sweringer. We were 
        doing homework. I&#8217;m sorry I&#8217;m late.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">My father scowled at me for a long moment, as if 
        he could discern the truth by staring at me long enough. I was sure he 
        was going to say, &#8216;bring me the belt&#8217;, but instead he said, 
        &#8220;Sweringer, isn&#8217;t that the kid who wears those homo pants? 
        You&#8217;re not becoming a homo are you?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Go wash up and come back to eat. Next time 
        you be more mindful of the time.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Yes sir.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Dinner went on as usual as we all ate in silence. 
        The TV was on and pop only watched the news. Normally I tuned out the 
        droning of the news guy, but this time I listened as he spoke about the 
        war. The places he named all sounded so very far away, but the names he 
        read, well they sounded too familiar.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">After dinner my mom came into my room and I gave 
        her the money I collected.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I was late, but I lost track 
        of time with Mrs. Henry.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. I know how she can talk. 
        She called a little while ago. You forgot to bring home her money.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Shoot, I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;ll stop by tomorrow 
        and get it from her.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">As my mom left I returned to reading my comic book. 
        After a while I went over to the closet I shared with my brother, pulled 
        out his favorite flannel shirt and chewed away the thread that held the 
        top button.</font><br>
