      raced around the corner of the dingy gray square building careful to dodge 
      the large pothole, jumped the railing, threw open the back door and let 
      it slam shut behind her. In the safety of the building she bent over double, 
      her lungs screaming for air and her heart pounding against the cage that 
      held it in place. 
      <p> She glanced down at her watch and saw she had made the five mile run 
        from the hotel where she worked afternoons as a maid in less than forty 
        minutes, her best time yet. She had been making the run five times a week 
        for nearly the last four years and her time had improved drastically. 
      </p>
      <p> Running had put her in the best shape of her life. She had always been 
        slender but the workout with a large backpack filled to brimming with 
        heavy textbooks on her back and a duffle bag with her work uniforms slung 
        over her shoulders, had melted away every ounce of fat and chiseled her 
        body into perfect form. With her dark brown eyes, voluptuous long brown 
        hair, smooth almond skin and killer curves she was nothing short of stunning.</p>
      <p> When her chest began to rise and fall at a steady rate and her heart 
        stopped fighting its way out of her body she went to her dressing room 
        that she shared with Sarah. One quick glance told her that Sarah had not 
        gotten there yet, not that she would have expected her here this early, 
        and she closed the door behind her. </p>
      <p> Carlie undressed and hopped into the shower. The cold water ran down 
        her back, cooling her body and washing away the sweat and the grim. At 
        first she savored the cool contrast of the water against her hot skin 
        but she quickly began to curse the bad plumbing job her boss Rick refused 
        to fix as her body involuntarily shuddered in the icy cold temperature 
        of water from pipes that refused to render any warmth. She quickly finished 
        her shower and got out.</p>
      <p> Reaching into her duffel Carlie pulled out a clean pair of sweats and 
        threw them on. Glancing at the clock overhead she noted that she had a 
        good hour to study before the other girls would begin arriving and she 
        would need to get ready.</p>
      <p> Carlie grabbed her backpack and dragged it over to her vanity mirror 
        that she used to get ready. Reaching into her bag she grabbed her laptop 
        and her notes from her interviews with the President of the Associated 
        Student Government at her University and a couple of students about the 
        upcoming presidential election. Having written hundreds of articles before 
        she quickly pounded out the piece for the school newspaper and made a 
        mental note to e-mail it to her editor when she got to school the next 
        day. Then she pulled out her communications notebook and began pouring 
        over her notes in preparation for her test the following week. She was 
        so absorbed in her studies that she did not hear the door open when Sarah 
        got there.</p>
      </font>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;BOO!&#8221; </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;God damn it Sarah!&#8221; Carlie screamed 
        as she jumped a foot in the air. &#8220;I hate it when you do that.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I know but it&#8217;s so funny,&#8221; 
        retorted Sarah with a kind-hearted lopsided grin that always made Carlie 
        forgive her immediately. &#8220;I do it every night and yet you never 
        fail to jump, it&#8217;s great. So how&#8217;s school going?&#8221; She 
        asked gesturing to Carlie&#8217;s mess of notes.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Good, hard to believe there&#8217;re only 
        two months left until I get to graduate and leave this hellhole.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I&#8217;m jealous, I&#8217;m going to be 
        stuck here forever, or at least until I&#8217;m too old and ugly to work 
        here anymore and then I&#8217;m just going to be screwed. So you heard 
        from any of the places you applied to yet?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Well you should go to school and no I&#8217;m 
        still waiting. Not sure if anyone will hire me until I have a degree in 
        my hand, but we&#8217;ll see. May&#8217;s not that far away. If I don&#8217;t 
        have a job before then I&#8217;ll just have to bug the hell out of them 
        again when I graduate.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Sarah chuckled and shook her head. &#8220;They 
        have a death wish if they decide to tell you no. Anyway we better start 
        getting ready; Rick&#8217;ll kill us if we aren&#8217;t ready on time 
        again.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Carlie grabbed her bag and pulled out her outfit 
        for the night. After she pulled off her sweats she put on a black lacy 
        bra and stepped into a matching thong, then she shimmied her way into 
        a skin tight black dress that was slit down past her navel and up past 
        her right hip. She sat down and grabbed her makeup bag and applied liberal 
        amounts of eye shadow and a red lipstick. After she had straightened her 
        hair she admired herself in the mirror. She wasn&#8217;t arrogant, but 
        she could not deny she was beautiful. One last look over and she was satisfied 
        that she was ready.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Hey, Candy, you ready?&#8221; Carlie asked 
        Sarah, referring to her stage name.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Yep. Let me get a good look at you, Destiny.&#8221; 
        Sarah said, turning to scrutinize Carlie. &#8220;Yep, absolutely gorgeous, 
        as usual. Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> They headed out together to the main room and 
        when they got there Destiny, for Carlie did not exist inside this room, 
        silently cursed all the men in the room for their womanizing ways and 
        then thanked God that they were that way, for after all they were paying 
        her way through college.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> She made her way to her table hopped up and began 
        to dance around the pole. Despite the disgust she was filled with, the 
        disgust she was always filled with, she kept dancing with a large smile 
        on her face and slowly, very slowly, began to seductively strip in order 
        to please the men surrounding her. When one of the younger, obviously 
        drunk, guys made a particularly uncouth slur and tried grabbing at her 
        she thought of the money that had already been thrown her way and then 
        reminded herself, just two more months.</font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> At the end of the night Carlie went back to her 
        dressing room, placed the wad of cash she had been tipped into her bag 
        and took another ice cold shower to wash away her sweat and all the beer 
        that had been spilt on her. When she stepped out she felt as though Destiny 
        had been left behind and she was just Carlie again. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Hey Sarah you ready to head home?&#8221; 
        Carlie asked when she was dressed and had her things together. Her eyes 
        were heavy from long day and she longed to fall into a comatose state 
        on her bed.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Yep, let&#8217;s go.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> They headed out to Sarah&#8217;s car and as they 
        turned the corner of the building towards the parking lot there were two 
        guys loitering in front of the club. Carlie instinctively got closer to 
        Sarah for protection.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Hey ladies, looking good,&#8221; said the 
        shorter, and apparently more drunk of the two. &#8220;Where are you two 
        headed?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> They ignored him knowing that pleasantries would 
        only encourage him and continued toward the car. Though they were walking 
        briskly the men quickly closed the gap between them.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;What&#8217;s the hurry ladies? How &#8216;bout 
        one more dance?&#8221; came his drunken slur.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> They continued on their path to the car but Carlie 
        felt a hand grab at her shirt and heard a ripping noise and felt cold 
        air against her abdomen. Her heart raced as she swiveled on the spot and 
        sprayed the can of mace that she had concealed in her hand at the man 
        who now held her shirt in his hand. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Carlie run!&#8221; She heard Sarah shout 
        and she took off toward the car.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> When they reached it they threw open the doors, 
        paused only a second to be sure no one was hiding in the backseat and 
        then pealed out of the parking lot.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> They rode in silence for a couple of miles until 
        they had both regained some composure.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Hey, Carlie, are you okay?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Yeah he just got my shirt and scared the 
        shit out of me but I&#8217;m fine. Are you okay?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I&#8217;m fine. Right after that short 
        guy ripped your shirt the other one tried to grab me but thank God I had 
        the taser, he got a nasty little shock, that&#8217;s when I told you to 
        run.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Stupid horny bastards.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Amen&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> When they reached the house Carlie stumbled up 
        the steps of the front porch and staggered down the hall to her small 
        room. She fell onto the bed exhausted, still shaken up from the attack 
        and though they were always prepared for one she had hoped she would never 
        actually ever have to use the mace, and she began to wonder if it was 
        all worth it. Then her thoughts turned to her mother but she fell asleep 
        before her thoughts could get very far.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> The next month passed in a slow torturous whirlwind 
        of mornings at school, afternoons working at the hotel, evenings dancing 
        on the pole and sleep-deprived nights. Then, with less than a month till 
        Carlie would walk and get her diploma, she received her graduation tickets. 
        She had only requested two. Knowing that Sarah was the only person who 
        would show up to see her graduate, she gave one of the tickets to her. 
        Then she took then other ticket, went to the local florist and got a bouquet 
        of two dozen roses and headed the train. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> When she got off she walked about a mile up the 
        road and turned onto the grassy slope. She walked up the hill, letting 
        her feet carry her up the familiar path and knelt down before a large 
        white tombstone. As was her routine she set down the flowers and then 
        slowly traced the name and inscription upon the tombstone.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Hey mom,&#8221; Carlie whispered. &#8220;Sorry 
        it&#8217;s been so long, things have been a little crazy recently. But 
        guess what? I&#8217;m graduating in about a month, May 19th. And I&#8217;m 
        graduating with honors, imagine that, I&#8217;m actually smart. Anyway 
        I brought you an invitation. Sarah is going to come and you&#8217;re the 
        only other person I really wish would be there. You know I love you, even 
        if you never could love yourself.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Carlie blew one kiss at the grave stone wishing 
        that she could see her mother again, and wondering why she had done it, 
        why anyone would do it. She would never forget the day she came home to 
        find her mother on the floor. When she found out she had done it to herself 
        Carlie understood just how bad the depression had been. That night Carlie 
        decided that she was not going to be a maid till it killed her as it had 
        her mother. So that night she applied for college and got a job as a stripper 
        to pay for it. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Carlie put in her two weeks notice at the hotel 
        the day she got her graduation tickets. She had never really needed the 
        job, but it provided a little extra cash for savings and gave her a stable 
        work history, for she sure as hell was not going to get a job at Harwitt 
        Publishing Group, her ultimate dream job, with four years of stripping 
        under her work experience. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> The last month of school went by in a frenzy. 
        She barely had time to catch her breath before she was walking to pick 
        up her diploma. After the ceremony was over she hurried to find Sarah. 
        She could hardly contain the broad grin the kept creeping its way onto 
        her face. When she finally found Sarah she too had a huge grin on her 
        face.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I&#8217;m so proud of my little Carlie,&#8221; 
        she said in a baby voice, but the sentiment behind it was real and powerful. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> For a moment Carlie could not speak. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Thanks for being here Sarah. It means a 
        lot to me.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have missed this for the 
        world. Now are you ready to go out into the real world and be an adult?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Well yeah, but I need a job first.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Okay so don&#8217;t kill me. This came 
        a few days ago but I figured it would be a perfect graduation present,&#8221; 
        Sarah said holding out a large envelope wrapped in hot pink paper.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Carlie grabbed it eying Sarah skeptically. She 
        opened it and saw that the envelope was from Harwitt Publishing Group. 
        </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;It&#8217;s from Harwitt I can&#8217;t believe 
        you! You suck!&#8221; She slugged Sarah playfully over the shoulder then 
        proceeded to rip open the envelope.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> She pulled out the contents and quickly read over 
        the cover letter, as she read she could not keep the excitement inside. 
        </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I got a job! I&#8217;m going to New York!&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;No way, when do you start?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;In July. I&#8217;m going to miss you like 
        crazy.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve applied to NYU and I got 
        in, so I&#8217;m going to be moving to New York. So what do you say? Roomies?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;You&#8217;re kidding!&#8221; Carlie screamed 
        and lunged into Sarah&#8217;s arms. She swelled with happiness and thought 
        that nothing could ever beat this. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> The next two months past in a blur. Though Carlie 
        was no longer working she was constantly busy with the preparations for 
        her new job and the big move. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Carlie and Sarah moved into their new two-bedroom 
        apartment in New York in late June. They spent two straight weeks moving 
        in, decorating and making the small space their own. On the morning of 
        July 10th Carlie woke up about an hour before the alarm clock went off, 
        too excited to sleep. She lay in bed thinking about the day that lay before 
        her. When she could not lie still any longer she got up and took a long 
        hot shower. When she got out she picked out the new black suit she had 
        just bought and a white blouse and got dressed. Then she applied a light 
        amount of makeup that accentuated her beauty without being overbearing. 
        She stood in front of the mirror and scrutinized her reflection, pleased 
        with what she saw she grabbed her things and headed out the door.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> She walked the two blocks to the Harwitt Publishing 
        Group building and paused in front of the large glass front doors. She 
        thought about being left by a father that did not care, being raised by 
        and left behind by a single mother to miserable to live, and about living 
        a life of depravity in order to fight her way through school. As she pushed 
        open the doors she stripped herself of all that had been done and everything 
        that was past for none of it mattered anymore.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> She had made it.</font><br>
