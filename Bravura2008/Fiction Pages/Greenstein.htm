    <td rowspan="28" align="left" valign="top"><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Story" --><font color="#FFFFFF">He 
      sat, huddled in the back of the booth, his coke bottle glasses sitting low 
      on his nose. Under the table, he could feel his portable time machine, hidden 
      safely on the inside of his pants. A six-inch long cylinder, he had heard 
      that it was only an average sized model, but was unconcerned with the build 
      as long as it functioned properly. And it certainly did function, he smiled 
      as he patted it, very well indeed. 
      <p>After all, it had succeeded at taking him back to the 21st century, to 
        the days before women had gone extinct, as it had many many times before. 
        And tonight, it would help him find a mate to take back with him - and 
        while it was true that he had experienced little luck in his quest before, 
        he had a good feeling about tonight.</p>
      <p>Flipping a switch on its side, he activated the scanning feature, and 
        used it to carefully examine the women scattered around the bar. On a 
        stool at the far end, he saw a blonde with moderately pleasant curves, 
        and a nice, pouty face. He closed his eyes. With the power in his pocket, 
        he could take her back to medieval times, for a titillating horseback 
        ride, or to ancient China, where he might lay her down on cherry blossoms 
        which smelt of untamed passion. Yes, he had the power. But was she the 
        correct choice?</p>
      <p>A slinky, tall redhead passed him by, and he briefly entertained the 
        thought of taking her back to the future with him, where the sleek shiny 
        towers that pierced the sky would overwhelm her with passion. But he straightened 
        up, and stopped his notion cold. As tempting as it was, he couldn't afford 
        to show his time machine to just anybody. If he showed it to a girl who 
        didn't understand, who was unsympathetic, then she could tell the police, 
        who could tell the government, who would certainly lock him up, and perform 
        tests on it until it would never work again. This time machine had seen 
        him through many hard times, and life without it, he shuddered, would 
        be lonelier than he could possibly bear.</p>
      <p>Unzipping the frontal pocket where he kept it hidden, he made a final 
        systems check before making his move. </p>
      <p>But wait.</p>
      <p>This couldn't be right. The small red light on the side, a warning that 
        indicated low battery power, was flashing. But how? He had just done an 
        oil check this morning! How could he have not noticed? Taking a nervous 
        drink from his beer, his hand started shaking. If he didn't get the power 
        back to an acceptable level soon, there was a chance he would experience 
        a system failure. He had no time to lose.</p>
      <p>A dark-eyed brunette passed by his booth, and he called out to her. &quot;Excuse 
        me, miss! Miss, I need your help with something...&quot;</p>
      <p>She barely turned as she passed by, and only acknowledged him with a 
        rude comment. &quot;What, did you lose your hairpiece? Good luck!&quot;</p>
      <p>He shuddered with anger, and ran his hand over his scalp. Where he was 
        from, his hip balding hairstyle was a symbol of status, of power and wealth. 
        Taking care to slip the time machine back into its pocket, he stood up 
        and walked after her. &quot;Miss! There's no need to be rude. I need your 
        help with something serious. This is a matter of life and death.&quot;</p>
      <p>She turned to him, clearly a little drunk and very annoyed. &quot;Look, 
        you've been watching me all night with those big freaky glasses of yours. 
        Tell me what you want, but promise to leave me alone after.&quot;</p>
      <p>In the future, his glasses symbolized that he was of royal stock - but, 
        rather than making a fuss out of it, he let it go. This was an emergency. 
        &quot;Look, I realize this is an odd request, but I really don't have 
        any time to explain it. You see... I have very powerful, potentially dangerous 
        machine in my pants. It's about to run out of power, and I need you to 
        help me get the motor running manually.&quot;</p>
      <p>She stared at him for a second, trying to comprehend his words, then 
        burst out with laughter. &quot;Ha... well, that's very creative. But the 
        answer is the same. Shoo!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Listen, I don't think you understand the danger we're in. This 
        thing is nuclear powered. If we don't get the motor working we could be 
        looking at a meltdown. I'm assuming that you don't want to get radiation 
        poisoning?&quot;</p>
      <p>Her eyes narrowed. &quot;Are you threatening me? Fuck off or I'll tell 
        the owner!&quot;</p>
      <p>His glasses nearly fell off as he hastily retreated to the safety of 
        his booth. What a dilemma! He couldn't afford to be caught, but if he 
        didn't get this thing working in a few minutes, that would be the least 
        of his worries. Using the table to hide his lap from prying eyes, he removed 
        it from its pocket and began rapidly cranking the manual lever, desperate 
        to keep the electricity flowing properly.</p>
      <p>A thud shook the booth, and he looked up. Jim the barkeep, a hulking 
        bear of a man, was staring at him, his fists on the table. &quot;Listen, 
        pal. What are you doing down there?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, I... uh... I seem to be, uh, sending a text message, on my 
        - what do you call them again - oh, on my cellular phone!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Really? Because I heard you telling one of those girls that you 
        had a, whatyacall, nuclear reactor or something down there.&quot;</p>
      <p>This was a bad situation. There was no way that he could enlist this 
        large man's help - it had to be a woman. As a means of theft prevention, 
        his time machine was equipped with a safeguard, so that if any male besides 
        himself touched it, it would instantly stop working. And if Jim touched 
        it now, on the verge of a power failure, there was no telling what could 
        happen. &quot;Look, sir, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy 
        as it looks. And I'd advise you to step back a bit - you don't want this 
        thing exploding in your face, now do you?&quot;</p>
      <p>Jim shook his head, disgusted. &quot;Look, man. You've been harassing 
        the girls and diddling yourself under the table all night. Normally, I'd 
        just kick you out, but one of the girls says that you threatened her. 
        Now some of the guys in the bar are a little put off by this, and would 
        like to have a little talk with you, out back of course, and... hey, hey, 
        man, seriously, would you mind laying off of yer hand exercises, for just 
        a minute while I'm talking to you?&quot;</p>
      <p>He and the Jim stared at each other for a few moments. The cranking continued. 
        This idiot barkeep, he thought, has no clue what is at stake here. If 
        I don't get away from him, now, his life and the lives of everyone in 
        this bar are in danger.</p>
      <p>Moving quickly to take the lug by surprise, he dashed out of one side 
        of the booth, darting for the door. As he ran, he continued pumping the 
        time machine, his eyes on the blinking red light. If he could only get 
        it to turn green, he could jump back to the future, but first he would 
        have to generate sufficient power, not easy while running for his life.</p>
      <p>Bursting out through the bar's front door, he turned slightly, to see 
        the barkeep almost directly behind him. He had been joined by three other 
        men, companions of some of the girls he had been considering. The four 
        of them were yelling, cursing loudly, calling him by whatever ancient 
        curse words came into their minds.</p>
      <p>He had almost gone a block when he saw the alley on his right - if he 
        could make it to a dead end, at least he could shield any innocent bystanders 
        of the devastating blast which was about to come. Ducking into the alley, 
        he doubled his speed, his pursuers slowed somewhat by the unexpected turn.</p>
      <p>He turned another corner, finding a dead end. This was it, he thought. 
        Just as he was about to release the machine from his grasp and let the 
        fatal explosion come, he saw the green light switch on. Finally, and just 
        in time, he thought, as he stroked the button at the tip.</p>
      </font>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Jim and his three followers turned the corner, 
        surprised to find that the bookish middle-aged man they had been pursuing 
        had somehow vanished. After a few minutes of searching all nearby garbage 
        cans, they gave up, and headed back to the bar, where they would proceed 
        to brag about the various bruises and cuts they had left him with.</font><br>
