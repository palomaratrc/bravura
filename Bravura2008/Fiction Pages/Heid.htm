      watched as her parents set the cardboard box down beside her, wide smiles 
      spread across their faces. They were almost glowing with pride, but their 
      daughter was certain it had nothing to do with her. She was right. Their 
      pride was in their solution for their daughter&#8217;s&#8230;strange hobbies. 
      <p>&#8220;Take a look in the box, sweetie,&#8221; he mother said, her eyes 
        twinkling. &#8220;There&#8217;s a surprise for you!&#8221; She turned 
        and winked at her husband, who winked back. Darcy ignored them, but turned 
        from reassembling her dismantled doll to lean over and look inside the 
        open top of the old Xerox paper box.</p>
      <p>Inside the box sat a tiny, six-week old kitten with short black hair 
        and huge blue eyes, staring up at her. Darcy stared down at him, and he 
        stared back at her, his nose wiggling in the air as he caught her scent. 
        Their eyes locked, and both studied the other carefully. Darcy watched 
        him for a moment longer, then slowly looked back up at her parents, who 
        were waiting with baited breath.</p>
      <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a kitty,&#8221; she said, in a flat voice lacking any 
        hint of excitement. &#8220;You got me a kitty.&#8221; She continued to 
        stare at her parents, whose smiles were beginning to falter. This was 
        the part she enjoyed the most, watching them squirm internally, trying 
        to maintain their fa&ccedil;ade. Her mother&#8217;s eyes were almost pleading 
        with Darcy to love the kitten, to take him into her arms and cuddle him 
        just like any other seven year old girl would. Darcy stared into those 
        eyes, those eyes that now began to water at the edges, just above the 
        fake smile that gradually started to tremble, ever so slightly.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Yes, sweetheart, it&#8217;s a kitty. And look! He has black hair 
        and blue eyes, just like you!&#8221; Darcy&#8217;s father chimed in. She 
        turned to look at him, and saw that he was looking down at the kitten, 
        who was yawning widely in the box. He couldn&#8217;t look at his daughter, 
        and seemed to hope desperately that his little girl would follow his gaze 
        downward.</p>
      <p>She looked back down at the kitten again, his huge blue eyes looking 
        back and forth from Darcy to her parents. He seemed unconcerned with either, 
        but he didn&#8217;t know the little girl before him. He&#8217;d never 
        met the neighbor&#8217;s dog, who cowered beneath the bushes when the 
        school bus rolled up outside in the afternoons, or the kids on the bus 
        who held their breath when the bus stopped outside in the mornings.</p>
      <p>&#8220;He&#8217;s cute,&#8221; Darcy said at last, and the audible sigh 
        from her parents let her know that they&#8217;d finally relaxed. She reached 
        into the box and carefully lifted the kitten out from the box. He mewed 
        softly as she brought him in and held him close, cuddling him against 
        her neck and stroking his silky fur. He closed his eyes and nuzzled his 
        head up underneath her chin, working to find a comfortable position. But 
        Darcy&#8217;s expression didn&#8217;t change, her eyes still blank, no 
        smile or giggle escaping her lips. She turned up to look into her parent&#8217;s 
        eyes again. He father was relaxed, with a genuine smile on his face, but 
        her mother was still rigid. The false smile on her face had melted from 
        one side so that only half remained, and her eyebrows had furrowed together 
        slightly. Darcy could almost hear the gears turning in her mother&#8217;s 
        head, could feel the concerns she had but was too frightened to voice.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Now, Darcy, you know that this will be a big responsibility. We 
        want you to have a pet, and you&#8217;ve been asking for one for a while, 
        but you need to make sure you take good care of him,&#8221; her mother 
        stated slowly, picking each word carefully. &#8220;You have to make sure 
        you feed him, and change his litter box, and play with him a lot, do you 
        understand?&#8221; Darcy pulled the kitten away from herself and held 
        him out at arms length, looking into his bright blue eyes.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Yes, mommy. I&#8217;ll play with him a lot,&#8221; she said without 
        even the tiniest hint of emotion in her voice. She glanced back up and 
        her mother&#8217;s smile was almost completely gone, and her eyebrows 
        had nearly pushed together completely just over her nose. Her father was 
        already moving back out of the room and reaching back to pull his wife 
        along with him.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Well, sweetie, we&#8217;ll just leave you to play with your kitty 
        for a bit, so you can decide on a good name for him,&#8221; Darcy&#8217;s 
        father said as he half-dragged his wife from the room with him. As they 
        stepped out into the hallway, they closed the door behind them, but then 
        Darcy&#8217;s mother popped it back open just a bit, and took one last 
        worried glance through the slit before leaving the door still slightly 
        ajar.</p>
      <p>Darcy returned her attention to her dismantled doll. She had been saddened 
        that the head had only survived through four tugs, as she had expected 
        it wouldn&#8217;t pop out until seven, and now she was having trouble 
        trying to push it back in. As she tried to jam it back on, she watched 
        the new kitten wander around her room aimlessly, sliding on the hardwood 
        floor and mewing every now and again at the various stuffed animals he 
        came across. He pounced on one, and wrestled with it for a few seconds, 
        before pushing off it and bounding across the room, coming to a stop just 
        a few inches from Darcy. He leaned back onto his haunches and stared up 
        at her face, waiting expectantly.</p>
      <p>Sighing at the uncooperative doll, Darcy placed the body parts on the 
        floor and stared at her new kitten. Her mother had told her quite clearly 
        that she was supposed to play with him, but Darcy wasn&#8217;t sure how 
        she should. As she considered how to play with a little kitten, she watched 
        as he wandered across the floor and started batting at a long, loose string 
        hanging off of the comforter on her bed. The kitten jumped and swiped 
        at the string, grabbing it in his teeth and trying to drag it to the ground. 
        Darcy kept watching for a moment, before she rose up and walked to her 
        dresser.</p>
      <p>Bending down in front of the dresser, she squeezed her fingers into a 
        small gap between two of the floorboards. Pulling hard, she lifted one 
        at one end into the air and pushed it back. Darcy then leaned in close 
        and squinted into the dark opening now in the floor before her. Grabbing 
        the nearby flashlight hidden under the dresser, she turned the light down 
        into the dark space.</p>
      <p>Dozens of metal blades gleamed back at her in the limited light. Knives 
        and scissors of all kinds lay in a jumbled heap against the ceiling of 
        the lower level of the house. Darcy reached into her personal stash, carefully 
        shifting the weapons around until she came to the item she was searching 
        for, a rusty pair of jagged pruning shears. Drawing them back out carefully, 
        she turned and stooped over to the kitten, still tussling with the long 
        thread.</p>
      <p>Reaching down, Darcy pulled the kitten away from the string. Bringing 
        the shears close to the bed, she snipped the loose thread close to the 
        edge of the comforter, then turned and let it fall to the waiting kitten, 
        which eagerly began wrestling with the liberated string across the floor 
        of the room. Darcy quickly returned to her hidden stash and deposited 
        the shears, then pushed the floorboard nearly back into position, leaving 
        it just barely popped open.</p>
      <p>The kitten continued to wiggle and squirm, chewing the edge of the string 
        and pulling at it with his paws. Darcy bent down and lifted the string 
        away from him, holding it in midair. He jumped at it and snagged it with 
        his claws, drawing her arm down towards the floor with the string firmly 
        clenched. She let him pull it down, then quickly pulled it back away, 
        and so they continued with the game of tug-o-war for a short while.</p>
      <p>Before long, Darcy began to grow bored with the game. Although the kitten 
        was cute, Darcy didn&#8217;t find that nearly as interesting as other 
        girls did. Leaving the kitten to shred the remains of the thread, she 
        returned to her weapon stash and pulled the board up. Reaching in again, 
        she felt around carefully until her hand grasped the handle she sought.</p>
      <p>Standing up slowly, she pulled a long, 9&#8221; carving knife out of 
        the floor. She turned around and walked to the corner of the room where 
        her stuffed animals, many covered with stitches from numerous repairs, 
        sat in a large pile. She leaned out over the pile, the end of the carving 
        knife held delicately between the grip of her forefinger and her thumb, 
        with the long blade pointed down. Closing one eye, Darcy looked down at 
        the stuffed animals and picked out a target. A stuffed puppy, one of her 
        favourites. He had more stitches than most of the others, at least. Lining 
        up the blade within her eyesight, she released the handle.</p>
      <p>A direct hit! The blade ripped into the belly of the stuffed puppy and 
        the knife tilted over, thumping lightly against the hardwood floor. A 
        wide smile spread across Darcy&#8217;s face as she bent to retrieve the 
        carving knife, stood and turned slowly toward the kitten, now hunkered 
        down with his back to her. She crossed the room and leaned out over him, 
        holding the blade carefully again with her finger and thumb, one eye open. 
        She watched the blade swing slightly, and then focused on her target, 
        smiling grandly. The kitten was still hunched down, playing with some 
        little thing. She slowly allowed the blade to slip&#8230;</p>
      <p>Then she stopped, and gripped the handle fully with her hand. She leaned 
        down close to the kitten to see what had enthralled him so completely. 
        Something moving&#8230;a spider! He had captured a spider, and was playing 
        with it! Darcy got down on her knees and turned to watch the kitten.</p>
      <p>He was batting at the spider, some large one with long legs, but it was 
        hurt and trying to escape. Two of the legs were missing, and three others 
        looked like they were broken. The spider tried to feebly drag itself away 
        on the three remaining legs, but the kitten would snag it and drag it 
        back in close, then wait for it to try to make a run for it again. Darcy 
        tilted her head to one side, and then smirked at the blatant game of torture. 
        She quickly returned the blade in her hand to its hiding place, and then 
        lay down on the floor beside the kitten, propping her head up in her arms 
        to watch this new game unfold.</p>
      <p><br>
        Darcy&#8217;s mother pushed the door open all the way and was relieved 
        to see her daughter smiling brightly at the kitten in the middle of the 
        floor, playing with some little thing she couldn&#8217;t see. At last, 
        she thought, my daughter is happy with something normal for once. She 
        came into the room and sat on her daughter&#8217;s bed, smiling genuinely 
        at the kitten playing so sweetly on the floor.</p>
      <p>&#8220;So, have you decided on what name you&#8217;d like for your little 
        kitten?&#8221;</p>
      <p>Darcy looked up at her mother&#8217;s question, and with a big smile 
        on her face replied quite clearly.</p>
