      very first day after the hurricane was probably the most maddening for everyone, 
      especially me. It was the worst hurricane that Tennessee had seen in years. 
      Merciless winds blowing over houses, flooding that effortlessly ruined foundations, 
      and a grand finale of tornados that practically wiped out our entire town. 
      I had moved there only three months prior to the storm, my wife and I wanted 
      a bigger property for our growing family. So far, with my precious wife 
      Julie and two sons, Eli and Jeffery, Duncan was the perfect place for the 
      four of us. Tennessee is such a beautiful area and the price of living is 
      much more affordable than Malibu, California. I would give anything to change 
      the past and stay back in California. I was working at the news station 
      when the storm went from bad to worse. All of us were asked to stay in a 
      downstairs corridor, since it was too dangerous to travel outside. I was 
      without my wife, without my boys, it was one of the most unsettling feelings 
      I can ever remember experiencing. The news station served as a safe refuge 
      from the storm. I tried to call my wife over and over again but there was 
      no response. 
      <p> It was the morning after the storm, and the local coverage began. I 
        was put on the front line as the onsite investigative reporter assigned 
        to report the damage from the most afflicted cities in the county. Of 
        all the sites we were scheduled to report on that morning, my perfect 
        town was first on the list. On the way over, I first heard Tom say something 
        to me very quietly in my ear in the news van on the way over. He had never 
        spoken to me prior to that morning, though throughout the years I had 
        grown more aware that he had always been there for me like a guardian 
        angel or something. I actually saw him the first time a few months ago 
        in front of our local grocery store. He followed me home. I wasn&#8217;t 
        threatened by him at all so I showed him my children and he smiled at 
        me, nodded his head in a positive consent, like the father I never had. 
        He then put his hands in his black leather jacket and saw himself out. 
        I assumed he worked as a crewmember since I had seen him around the newsroom 
        more often. Nice fellow, just very quiet until now. &#8220;Your wife is 
        a smart woman, she probably left town as soon as she heard about the storm.&#8221; 
        He said. &#8220;I hope so.&#8221; I replied. My breathing became shallow 
        and I clenched my fist as the adrenaline in my blood began to surge through 
        my veins. It was the moment of fight or flight, but I couldn&#8217;t choose 
        either one, so I contemplated my escape that day instead. I just needed 
        to find my family first.</p>
      <p> Once I stepped out of the news van, onto the middle of our mangled cul-de-sac 
        that had been completely leveled to the ground, my heart dove into my 
        churning stomach as I looked at the remains of our custom built home leveled 
        with the ground. I felt helpless as firemen rummaged through my broken 
        hopes and dreams of the future. As I began my on screen coverage, I pushed 
        the words out as hard as I could, though the tears in my eyes were not 
        about to recoil without a fight. I gripped my microphone and kept talking. 
        Tom was watching from behind the camera. I cringed when I looked over 
        Tom&#8217;s shoulder to see a gurney being taken out of the ambulance 
        and carried over to what was left of the house behind me. My house. My 
        future. My family. The coverage ceased for commercial break and I sprinted 
        over to the site. There I saw my wife&#8217;s broken body holding onto 
        what was left of our two infant sons. It was curious why they were not 
        able to escape the storm in time but Tom told me that the autopsy would 
        later reveal that she had fallen down our staircase with the babies in 
        both arms knocked unconscious with a broken leg. Our telephone lost reception 
        and I was the only one carried a cell phone, but I was going to surprise 
        her with a new cell phone that same day I saw her lifeless cadaver defeated 
        by the ruthless war waged with hurricane Dawn. </p>
      <p> Tom stood over my shoulder and started to laugh at me. I felt my anger 
        and disgust invade my face as I looked back at him. &#8220;What were you 
        expecting to live happily ever after?&#8221; I had no response, so he 
        continued. &#8220;That&#8217;s life little man. You gotta be prepared 
        for the worst. Laugh it off man, that&#8217;s what Julie would want from 
        ya now anyways.&#8221; If I could have felt anything besides the initial 
        shock that had just settled in, I would have taken Tom out. What the hell 
        did he know about Julie? &#8220;Take it like a man Phil Braxton!&#8221; 
        Tom yelled and the tears streamed down my face. He was right. Commercial 
        break was just about over. One of the camera men approached me and asked, 
        &#8220;Hey man are you alright?&#8221; &#8220;Just peachy.&#8221; I replied 
        &#8220;Now let&#8217;s get this over with.&#8221;</p>
      <p> I rented a hotel room that night. My life felt so worthless. At eight 
        o&#8217;clock exactly, Tom walked into the room. </p>
      <p>&#8220;How the hell did you get a key?&#8221; </p>
      <p>&#8220;You asked the front desk to have an extra ready for me, I was 
        right there. Man, you&#8217;re really loosing it.&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;Yeah, maybe I am.&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;Wanna get a drink or something?&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;What the hell?&#8221;</p>
      <p>I never drank, but I couldn&#8217;t think of anything else to do besides 
        standing in front of the radio finding the perfect grand finale theme 
        to my hotel balcony descent from a life that was supposed to have a happy 
        ending behind the white picket fence. I had a beer and then called it 
        a night; I couldn&#8217;t stand sulking in my misery any longer. So, I 
        popped some sleeping pills and called it a night. The unexpected alarm 
        of the clock the following morning felt like someone had tazered my brain. 
        It was five o&#8217;clock. I was scheduled to report at nine. I was filling 
        in as an anchor this morning. By five fifteen I was showered. By five-thirty 
        I shaved and dressed and at precisely five fifty I ate a lowly cereal 
        bar without the sound the boys or Julie straightening my tie when I requested 
        every morning at exactly five fifty-two. I dropped the cereal bar and 
        left eight minutes earlier for work than I had for the last three years. 
        I couldn&#8217;t stand it anymore. </p>
      <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the rush? You&#8217;re early, Phil.&#8221; Tom said 
        as he came out from the back corner of the linen closet. I jumped while 
        I reached for my jacket. Tom continued, &#8220;Now that you have a little 
        extra time this morning there are some new rules we need to cover. I can 
        grant you a guaranteed happy life again as long as you do exactly what 
        I say. Now, I&#8217;ve been around you for quite a while, and I know what 
        it will take to make you forget all of this and never feel this pain again. 
        There was something about the way he said it that was so genuine, and 
        I felt that I had nothing else to loose.</p>
      <p>&#8220;What do you want me to do?&#8221; I asked</p>
      <p>&#8220;I have some top secret stories that are not being broadcasted, 
        but every word you say is a secret code that will eventually guarantee 
        your happiness and future protection from disaster. Just report it today 
        as an urgent message; I&#8217;ll chime in on your earpiece as you repeat 
        exactly what I say.&#8221; I knew that I could trust him more than anyone 
        else. He had been there with me through thick and thin. I owed this to 
        him.</p>
      <p>&#8220;By the way, you must repeat exactly what I tell you. If you screw 
        up any of the words, many very powerful people will be after you. Everyone 
        is watching you. Many of them are disguised in the studio.&#8221; He stated 
        sternly. </p>
      <p>&#8220;But why? What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; I asked.</p>
      <p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you about all of that right now. It&#8217;s 
        not safe here.&#8221;</p>
      <p>He seemed to know what he was talking about so I didn&#8217;t ask any 
        further questions. My heart ached to retreat back to simpler times, but 
        they had been crushed. They were too fragile and perfect to withstand 
        any of the gales of an imperfect world. </p>
      <p>Make up had finished and we had less than a minute to spare before the 
        cameras would roll. I checked my earpiece and noticed a few dark characters 
        lurking in the back of the studio. Tom looked a bit nervous behind the 
        camera, but no one around him seemed to notice, or even care. Everyone 
        else was so preoccupied with their own world, they didn&#8217;t have a 
        clue. There I was, with my life on the line and no one even knew to care. 
      </p>
      <p>&#8220;And, 5, 4, 3, 2&#8230;&#8221; the camera man continued with one 
        finger pointing to me, and I began reading the queue right on schedule, 
        as always. I reported on further coverage of the terrible storm. No deaths 
        were reported. How could that be? My wife and twin sons were carried out 
        behind me yesterday. I know what I saw! I was livid. Then I wondered how 
        many other unknown lives were lost yesterday? Just then Tom buzzed in. 
        I placed my index finger n my ear and began reporting every word he said. 
      </p>
      <p>&#8220;This just in, there is a war about to break out here in town! 
        We must all take cover immediately! You, must, cover? No. Oh! Take cover! 
        Take cover!&#8221; Once I had said something wrong, the shady men in the 
        back of the studio rushed towards me I immediately ran out of the studio 
        as fast as I could. Tom caught up with me, and we both kept running until 
        we came to a nearby park. &#8220;Hide under here, I&#8217;ll keep watch.&#8221; 
        Tom said breathlessly. On my hands and knees I crawled underneath a park 
        bench, where I felt safe. I was there for an hour or so until the local 
        news reporters found me behind Tom. They ignored Tom and went straight 
        to me. I was the public icon, Tom was just another average-Joe, almost 
        invisible, always able to go unnoticed for as long as I&#8217;ve known 
        him. The mysterious men had followed the police and reporters and hid 
        behind the news vans as I was interrogated by the small plethora of local 
        news reporters and policemen. I refused to answer any further questions, 
        and the police escorted me into their car. The world had turned against 
        me. </p>
      <p>&#8220;Mr. Braxton, could you identify your sources? After reviewing 
        all of our sources, there are no real threats to this area whatsoever. 
        So, I must be missing something here, I feel that I need to know about. 
        Anything you wanna tell me?&#8221; The police officer put up his hands 
        and sighed. I was alone in a dark interrogation room. No children, no 
        Julie, no Tom. Another officer entered into the room. </p>
      <p>&#8220;Look Phil, you&#8217;re safe here. You can tell us everything. 
        I know you&#8217;re going through some rough times since your divorce 
        and all, but&#8230;&#8221; </p>
      <p>&#8220;She&#8217;s dead.&#8221; I interrupted.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Pardon?&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;She&#8217;s dead! She died in the storm this last week.&#8221; 
        I yelled</p>
      <p>&#8220;Phil, we just talked to your ex-wife Julie fifteen minutes ago. 
        She&#8217;s in Malibu, with your twin sons. She left you three months 
        ago and then you got a reporting job out here in Tennessee.&#8221; He 
        was rather smug about it as if it was a practical joke. He crossed his 
        arms and shook his head. &#8220;Can you explain this to me Phil?&#8221; 
        he asked.</p>
      </font>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;We moved here three months ago living a 
        perfect life, more perfect than ever before, until our house was destroyed 
        and she was killed with our children in that perfect house we were always 
        supposed to live in. Our little dream had come true.&#8221; My heart felt 
        lighter at thought of our perfect little world I gazed over the heads 
        of the police officers and past the wall as Tom entered into the interrogation 
        room. He smiled, placed his hand on my shoulder, and the world then faded 
        away forever. </font><br>
