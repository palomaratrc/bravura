    <td rowspan="28" align="left" valign="top"><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Story" --><font color="#FFFFFF">Five 
      days ago my Grandpa died. He was a hundred and two years young. I found 
      this news out from my brother Jeremiah who is basically the only one in 
      my entire nutty family &#8211;both sides- that will even talk to me. It&#8217;s 
      been this way for almost three years so I&#8217;m used to it. Jeremiah informed 
      me that there was going to be a wake for Grandpa North. This meant that 
      if I wanted to attend I would have to show my face amongst a crowd who didn&#8217;t 
      want to see it. In fact judging my slightly off kilter family I&#8217;m 
      sure I will get a round house eruption of earth shattering gasps and judgmental 
      grunts. 
      <p>So all that considered I skipped the funeral. I couldn&#8217;t go into 
        the church or out to the cemetery, a force of uncanny gigantic proportions 
        was stopping me. That and the fact that I didn&#8217;t want to steal away 
        any attention from my Grandpa. He earned his time in the sun. I mean of 
        course he earned that much it&#8217;s not like he is going to be sun bathing 
        in the Caribbean any time soon. </p>
      <p>Now I am sitting outside McCaffrey&#8217;s Pub in my little red rental 
        car. From my vantage point everything seems to be running smoothly. The 
        dark wood interior and soft lighting of the pub compliments my family 
        members, who for the most part are laughing solemnly into their beer mugs. 
        I can&#8217;t go in there. The second I do it will be total chaos. I will 
        be the herald for anguish and despair amongst the cavalry. This is not 
        how I pictured getting back into my family&#8217;s life. Of course sitting 
        outside of the pub watching the rain pelt my windshield isn&#8217;t really 
        doing much for me either. I wish the rain drops were strong enough to 
        knock me unconscious than I wouldn&#8217;t have to sit here ruminating, 
        contemplating, and loathing my very existence. </p>
      <p>Part of me knows I have every right to walk in there and make my peace 
        with Grandpa North&#8217;s spirit. I mean if I don&#8217;t pay my regards 
        then what if his restless soul haunts me for eternity? I wonder if he 
        accepts visa. The commercials say it&#8217;s accepted anywhere but do 
        they mean the afterlife too? By the way how much do regards run for these 
        days? I&#8217;m on a starving waitress/actress budget here.</p>
      <p>Oh crud I&#8217;ve been spotted. Why didn&#8217;t I rent a Mafioso type 
        car where the windows are completely blacked out to the watchful human 
        world? Thankfully the figure approaching my car is just Jeremiah. He is 
        my oldest sibling and only brother. I give him a small wave as he circles 
        the front of my car. Without being invited he climbs into the passenger&#8217;s 
        seat. He&#8217;s in a black business suit and he even has nice shoes on. 
        That&#8217;s a major step up on the style scale for a software programmer. 
        His murky blonde hair is a mess but hey not even Grandpa North can have 
        everything.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Eliza I am so glad you came.&#8221; It&#8217;s good to hear his 
        scruffy low self confidence voice in person as opposed to over the phone. 
        He leans across the cup holders and hugs me. I don&#8217;t let out the 
        whimper I have been holding back since I arrived in my home state of Illinois. 
        Or as I like to call it Illinoying.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Jer&#8221; I say feeling myself deflate into a two week old birthday 
        balloon. &#8220;I can&#8217;t go in there.&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; He asks innocently enough even though his face 
        has this look that just screams &#8220;if I were you I wouldn&#8217;t 
        go in there&#8221;.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Is Sherri inside?&#8221; I know the answer. Of course she is in 
        the pub. She probably arranged the whole wake and went as far as making 
        place cards for the bloody thing. That&#8217;s my big sister though always 
        ready to be perfect with a side order of impeccable.</p>
      <p>Jeremiah shrugs out a yes. Then he begins to draw a stick figure on one 
        of my fogging up windows. How this man grew up to be thirty five is beyond 
        me. &#8220;I wish this feud could end already. Everyone is sick of it.&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;I have apologized through the roof there is nothing else I can 
        do. She has to stamp my passport for me even to gain entrance into the 
        family again. In fact if she knew you stayed in touch with me you would 
        be evicted from Sherri-land. Let&#8217;s face it I&#8217;m a red flagged 
        immigrant in a hostile country.&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;Mom misses you.&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;Oh, when does she have time to do that?&#8221; My voice propels 
        up two octaves but I continue. &#8220;She is way to busy calling me tramp, 
        whore, and slut to think differently of me.&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not true mom never uses those words. She simply says 
        what you did was undignified.&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s my life goal to be dignified.&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;Eliza I am sick of being in the middle here. Your sisters, were 
        family, move on.&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;I want to she doesn&#8217;t. Do you think it&#8217;s any fun spending 
        Christmas in California where the weather is monotone and the company 
        I keep is bleak?&#8221;</p>
      <p>Jeremiah pats his legs in frustration. He furrows his brow towards me 
        than in a slow Texas drawl he says &#8220;I dare you varmint.&#8221; </p>
      <p>Just hearing the dare makes me want to sprint into the pub at an Olympic 
        worthy rate. Of course he knew I couldn&#8217;t resist a dare. I&#8217;m 
        spiteful like that. &#8220;Fine&#8221; I say evenly. I can&#8217;t freak 
        out now this is just the storm before the apocalypse.</p>
      <p>Meticulously I fix my hair in the car mirror. My unnatural blonde tresses 
        are frizzing out because of the rain. On the plus side though my makeup 
        looks great, especially since I lined my oak brown eyes with a plum pencil. 
        All things considered I appear as if I am ready for reunion war games. 
      </p>
      <p>Jeremiah opens my car door for me and reaches out his hand. I can tell 
        he is anxious. Although I don&#8217;t know why he is not the one who has 
        to go in there and face a roomful of frienemies.</p>
      <p>Walking across the street I swear I hear the Jaws theme song playing 
        in the distance. This is not going to begin or end well. </p>
      <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re shaking.&#8221; Jeremiah whispers as we reach the 
        door.</p>
      <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m freezing.&#8221; I say flatly. The truth is I am feeling 
        like a cheetah in Antarctica -a little cold but more out of place than 
        anything else. </p>
      <p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be fine Eliza.&#8221; Jeremiah hugs me then yanks 
        the door to the pub wide open. </p>
      <p>Slowly I traipse in and look around the room. No one has noticed me yet. 
        I take another step forward and the sound of my pointy heels on the wood 
        floor is enough to wake the dead - pun most definitely intended. Then 
        just like at any major sports game during a dramatic moment -sans the 
        losers with no class- a hush falls over the crowd. </p>
      <p>The silence is only temporary because a glass breaks towards the back 
        of the pub. I follow the noise and see that it was Sherri&#8217;s champagne 
        flute which is now in pieces. </p>
      <p>&#8220;What in Grandpa North&#8217;s name are you doing here Lizzie?&#8221; 
        Sherri snarls at me like a wrestling champ. She also went for the low 
        blow using my baby nickname. I want to correct her but mild name calling 
        is barely the fracas I had envisioned. </p>
      <p>&#8220;I came to pay my respects.&#8221; I say blocking out the crowd 
        of familiar yet fresh faces.</p>
      <p>&#8220;You have no respect for yourself so you shouldn&#8217;t really 
        go around trying to give any away.&#8221; Sherri has a big nose and it 
        flares when she talks. I forgot that considering it&#8217;s been three 
        years since we&#8217;ve stood face to face.</p>
      <p>&#8220;This&#8230;&#8221; I hold out my hands motioning to the entire 
        pub. &#8220;Is not about us.&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;You ruined my life! It will always be about what you did to me.&#8221; 
        Sherri sends tears down her face at the speed of a humming bird. She is 
        three years older than me and has putridly colored red hair. It&#8217;s 
        like she aimed for Debra Messing but got Carrot Top instead. And now that 
        her face is all red and puckered she looks even worse. But underneath 
        her horrible: hair, clothes, and overall appearance I still love her. 
        Plus I miss her more than I missed bagels when I went on that low carb 
        diet four years ago. Yep, my history shows I always do stupid things.</p>
      <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve made a few mistakes. And sadly you paid a price for 
        them. But Sher that was three years ago. Time is supposed to be what the 
        doctor ordered in situations like this. What can I do to make you just 
        forgive me?&#8221; I plead. My mother lets out a cough just as I hear 
        my sister take in a deep tear constricted breath. </p>
      <p>Sherri fixes her eyes directly at mine. Then she screams out a monologue 
        that I am sure has Grandpa North getting some exercise even in his freshly 
        minted casket. &#8220;YOU CAN REWIND TO THREE YEARS AGO. YOU CAN NOT SLEEP 
        WITH MY HUSBAND. YOU CAN NOT GET CAUGHT BY ME. YOU CAN NOT GET PREGNANT. 
        AND YOU CAN NOT GIVE THE KID UP FOR ADDOPTION.YOU COULD DO ALL THAT AND 
        THEN MAYBE I WILL FORGIVE YOU!!!&#8221;</p>
      <p>A few distant relatives who didn&#8217;t know the whole story let out 
        those earth shattering gasps I had predicted earlier. I look up to a ceiling 
        fan and watch it make a few trips around. I kind of wish that thing could 
        knock me out. Then my whole family could leave while trampling over me 
        and preferably giving me some major concussion. I could wake up tomorrow 
        with no recollection of who I am. </p>
      <p>&#8220;Sherri&#8221; I say softly &#8220;The second time travel is invented 
        that&#8217;s exactly what I plan on doing.&#8221; I know being a snide 
        wench is really not the best route to take in this drama filled road trip 
        but I have no other options. I&#8217;m genuinely sorry about everything. 
        In fact I have repented so many times in last three years that the next 
        time around I am sure to get a free sandwich with my overly stamped card.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; Sherri says through clenched teeth. She charges 
        at me pummeling me to the ground upon contact. I feel her grab my hair 
        in typical girl fight fashion. But I fight back by snapping the strap 
        off of her ugly raisin colored dress. She punches at my face and I manage 
        to kick her in the gut. I can&#8217;t tell but out of the corner of my 
        eye I see creepy Uncle Greg smiling. Eww. Sherri elbows me in my chest 
        but I roll a little to the left then ram directly into her back. I see 
        her head slam to the ground but she quickly retracts and starts in on 
        me again. </p>
      <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never forgive you&#8221; She yells thrashing her hands 
        all over my face.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Could you at least try?&#8221; I murmur mainly because she won&#8217;t 
        stop hitting me in the face for it to be any louder than a murmur. I pull 
        back my right hand and clock her straight in the jaw. Were about to both 
        shed more blood when I feel hands pulling me away. </p>
      <p>Looking back I see that Jeremiah is restraining me while my poor dad 
        is holding back Sherri. She is wildly waving around a clump of my hair 
        in her right hand. I wonder where the bald spot is! </p>
      <p>I watch as Sherri spits something onto the floor. It seems that I knocked 
        out one of her front teeth. She looks like a hockey player now. &#8220;Lisszzzzeee 
        get out of here.&#8221; Sherri says only when she talks she has a lisp 
        that is undeniably funny. She cracks a smile at hearing her own voice 
        but then quickly resumes to grimacing at me.</p>
      <p>&#8220;I will only go when you ssszzzaay you forgive me.&#8221; I mimic 
        her lisp hoping to make her laugh. Sherri lets out a small chuckle. Maybe 
        I am breaking through her armor and she is seeing how stupid this jousting 
        tournament has become.</p>
      <p>&#8220;How can I forgive you when you ruined my good looksszz?&#8221; 
        Sherri starts to laugh as tears begin to fall down her slightly bruised 
        face. Her laughter increases to a psychotic level. That alone leads me 
        to believe that she is allowing all of the tension from the last three 
        years to evaporate into the dingy pub&#8217;s acoustics.</p>
      <p>My body shakes and then I realize I am crying through laughter too. How 
        long has that been happening? I&#8217;m not really a crier or a laugher 
        come to think of it. Jeremiah eases up on me and I break lose rushing 
        immediately to Sherri &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for everything especially 
        the tooth. I&#8217;m going to pay for you to get it fixed.&#8221;</p>
      <p>Sherri reaches out and hugs me. It&#8217;s not a hostile hug either which 
        means my rights to visit Sherri-land may just have been approved. &#8220;Isszz 
        okay I am dating a dentisszzt.&#8221; She says into my ear.</p>
      <p>I giggle/cry at her lisp then respond &#8220;Good you&#8217;ll get a 
        disszzcount.&#8221; She laughs while pulling me back into an embrace. 
        Clapping comes from various directions of the room. Then my mom pops out 
        of nowhere and begins a group hug that looks more like a giant messy conga 
        line. <br>
        <br>
        I watch as Jeremiah fights his way through the boisterous drunk crowd. 
        He is out of breath by the time he reaches us. &#8220;So this is done 
        right we can go on with our lives?&#8221; He addresses Sherri more than 
        me.</p>
      <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting passzzt it if you are?&#8221; Sherri says looking 
        in my direction.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Well it depends&#8221; I reply. &#8220;How cute is this dentist?&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;For the love of Grandpa North&#8221; Sherri crosses her arms while 
        shaking her head at me.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Too soon huh&#8221; I say crinkling my nose. She smiles back letting 
        me know she actually got the joke. Maybe she isn&#8217;t such a stiff 
        after all. &#8220;Its sad our reunion had to happen over Grandpa North&#8217;s 
        dead body.&#8221; I add.</p>
      <p>Jeremiah can&#8217;t resist the urge to smirk at me &#8220;Inappropriate 
        as usual Eliza&#8221;</p>
