      <div align="center"><strong><font color="#FFFFFF">The House on a Hill </font></strong><font color="#FFFFFF"> 
        </font></div>
      <font color="#FFFFFF">
<p> The house sat snugly between its neighbors, like any other house might, 
        but in Emma Bailey&#8217;s mind it loomed larger than all others. First 
        there was a small patch of green, vivid in the waning afternoon sun. Yellow 
        flowers, weeds, floated above the rest, popping in contrast to the shy 
        white fence behind them. Behind the fence there was sky and between the 
        white fence and blue sky were the naked gray limbs of winter trees. Behind 
        the fence and under the trees was the stately yellow Victorian house where 
        Emma Bailey had just returned home for the first time in nearly a year 
        for her father&#8217;s annual Winter Solstice dinner party. The sight 
        of the house was at first overwhelming. Briefly, Emma considered asking 
        the cab driver to take her back to the airport. Equal parts joy and dread 
        compelled her to enter.</p>
      <p>Emma, weary with jetlag, sat in the breakfast nook while her younger 
        sister Cat made coffee, talked too loud and slammed cabinet doors. The 
        other guests were due to arrive in less than an hour.</p>
      <p> A set of unique, hand-printed tarot style cards hung in the kitchen, 
        over the breakfast table where her anticipation fought fatigue. Emma stared 
        at the cards as if she could will them to reveal a new meaning. She only 
        remembered her father&#8217;s words. &#8220;Pauline could quit teaching 
        and live off those things.&#8221; He would say, shaking his head as he 
        examined them for the hundredth time over his morning coffee. He had hopes 
        for an exhibition of the cards, greedy hopes for a chance to prove to 
        himself his set was the best one. He had only seen two other sets but 
        he believed there to be many more, possibly hundreds. Each one was a story, 
        broken down into several images and characters, laid out under a frame 
        as if telling a fortune. His set was an obscure assemblage of fate: The 
        Piano-Forte, Moonlight on the Moor, The Villian Paramour, The Gown, The 
        Feast and The House on a Hill.</p>
      <p> At another dinner party, years ago, Pauline had said the card sets were 
        her life&#8217;s passion and Emma thought she understood perfectly. It 
        was noble and it made sense to devote one&#8217;s life to making exquisite 
        gifts. &#8220;I love them so much I print each one only once and then 
        I destroy the plate.&#8221; Pauline laughed although it was unclear at 
        what.</p>
      <p>At what seemed an appropriate moment, Emma shyly laughed as well, darting 
        a furtive glance at a man at the opposite end of the table. &#8220;Thank 
        God I don&#8217;t love anything that much.&#8221;</p>
      <p>He could not hear her words but his eyes had glittered in response.</p>
      <p>Pauline had laughed and said something witty or wise that Emma had later 
        written down in her diary. She could not remember what it was.</p>
      <p>Cat put a cup of coffee on the breakfast table on top of a dog-eared 
        copy of Northanger Abbey, splashing a little on the cover. &#8220;You&#8217;re 
        not even listening to me, you bitch.&#8221;</p>
      <p>&#8220;Nice to see you too.&#8221;</p>
      </font> 
      <p align="center"></p>
      <p align="center"><strong><font color="#FFFFFF">The Gown</font></strong></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> When Emma was a little girl, Pauline gave her 
        a book of famous old paintings. One of the color plates showed a Renaissance 
        wedding portrait, the woman wearing a green dress and resting a pale hand 
        on her rotund belly. From then on, Emma had imagined that if she got married, 
        she too would wear green. She had never liked white. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">As Emma dressed for the party, she thought of dressing 
        for her imaginary wedding. She would have to put more makeup under her 
        eyes to cover those dark circles. She would require a dab of perfume at 
        the nape of her neck. She lingered a long time over her hair, teasing 
        its flat, smooth strands into voluptuous dark waves. If the image faded 
        before she finished dressing her excitement remained. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Emma looked intently into the mirror when she finished 
        dressing. A haunted house, she mused. A magic mirror. Her mother&#8217;s 
        wide eyes and thin lips in her father&#8217;s round face in a familiar 
        gilt frame was an image that spoke more of home than the bay bridge, tollbooths 
        and the endlessly looping freeways. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Guests were arriving, chatting and opening doors. 
        There was laughter and the rustling sounds of coats being taken off and 
        hung up. The scent of garlic, curry, butter and meat entered with them. 
        Her father called her name from downstairs. Her pulse quickened yet she 
        remained at the mirror, deriving a false sense of calm from her own placid 
        reflection. The ghost of a little girl searching herself for the spirit 
        of a mother on the longest and most haunted night of the year.</font></p>
      <p></p>
      <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>The Villian Paramour</strong></font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;So how are you, young lady? We haven&#8217;t 
        seen you in a long time.&#8221; Guy Leon grinned like a Cheshire Cat.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Great.&#8221; As Emma took a step back 
        from the crowd to be nearer to her interlocuter, her glass caught the 
        last sunbeams of the day. Like a votive candle it cast a warm glow over 
        her hands, neck and face. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;So glad you still remember us little people.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Only the smallest.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Say something sexy in French for me.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> She rolled her eyes at his pleading puppy dog 
        look and gave in. It was still instinctive for her to please him, just 
        a little. &#8220;Pas ce soir. J&#8217;ai mal a la tete.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Whatever that was, I&#8217;m excited.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;It means not tonight, I have a headache.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Damn, that is sexy.&#8221; He must have 
        gotten those lines around his eyes while she was away. He had never looked 
        so old before.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I know.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> He gazed at her for a moment rich with tenderness 
        and desire. &#8220;We&#8217;ve missed you.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;How is Sophia?&#8221; </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;She has a cold.&#8221; His wife always 
        seemed to have a cold when Mr. Bailey was having a party. &#8220;What&#8217;s 
        the matter with you tonight? You&#8217;re not yourself.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I have this really bad hangnail, see it? 
        Plus I stubbed my toe when I had my shoes off at the airport, and don&#8217;t 
        even get me started on how bloated I am from that airplane food.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> His jaw twitched. &#8220;You aren&#8217;t being 
        very kind to your old friend tonight.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> It would be so easy, Emma mused, to fall back 
        into their old pattern of loving, fighting and loving again. Even the 
        painful parts would be easy from familiarity. Worse than easy, it was 
        almost inevitable that within a week he would be in her bed again, or 
        even worse, in the backseat of his car, kissing her shoulder and whispering 
        that he would love her forever. Emma would hear him with a thrill of pleasure 
        and later wonder how he could possibly be so insensitive. She almost looked 
        forward to it though the thought gave her vertigo. She had to pull herself 
        back from the edge.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Kindness?&#8221; Emma laughed, recalling 
        a private joke between them. &#8220;You can go to your other girlfriends 
        for kindness. Jesus, do you even remember which one I am?&#8221; </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Amy, right? And you know what, I would, 
        but Uma&#8217;s been so moody lately and Angelina keeps saying something 
        about a restraining order&#8230;I know she doesn&#8217;t mean it.&#8221; 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Before Emma could twist her smirk into a reply, 
        Cat approached, slurring slightly and tugging at Emma&#8217;s arm. &#8220;Em, 
        Dad wants your help at the bar. You won&#8217;t believe this, but he thinks 
        maybe I&#8217;ve been sneaking drinks.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Is that my bracelet?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Cat slipped it up her sleeve. &#8220;I refuse 
        to answer such absurd allegations!&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I&#8217;ll be there in a minute Kitty, 
        the grown-ups are talking.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> He smiled. &#8220;We have a lot of catching up 
        to do, Emma. You&#8217;ll have to come visit me soon.&#8221; He abruptly 
        broke away from her side and began to cross the room.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Emma nodded and smiled cooly. She had hoped to 
        be the one to walk away but it was impossible to call him back.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> He turned to her again after a few brisk steps. 
        &#8220;Oh, I almost forgot. I just heard your father say your old friend 
        Peter is on his way.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Oh?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Yes.&#8221; A cruel smile. &#8220;With 
        his fiance.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p></p>
      <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>The Feast</strong></font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Mr. Bailey measured the success of any dinner 
        party held in his home by the degree to which guests were forced out of 
        the dining room by space constraints. He observed the assembled party 
        in his living room, holding plates over their knees, with great satisfaction. 
        His neighbors and colleagues mingled with old friends and new friends, 
        friends of his daughters and their families. He also derived great satisfaction 
        from seeing his daughters enjoy the party. Catherine was in high spirits, 
        sharing a chair at the dining room table with her best friend. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Emma had seemed lively earlier, passing out cocktails 
        and glasses of wine. Now, however, she was perched on the arm of a chair 
        in the corner of the living room, quietly picking at her plate as the 
        elderly woman who lived up the street prattled on about the edible flowers 
        in her garden. &#8220;Nasturtiums too, of course. There&#8217;s some in 
        the salad I brought. They&#8217;re a little peppery. Have one.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> He pulled Emma aside. &#8220;Are you enjoying 
        the party, dear?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Mm-hmm.&#8221; She chewed the orange flower 
        vigourously. &#8220;It&#8217;s very nice. But these potatoes,&#8221; she 
        gestured at her plate, &#8220;could use some poppies, no? Who brought 
        them?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Are you really having 
        a good time? You look a little down.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;You&#8217;d be feeling bad too if your 
        opium habit got disrupted. You heard me father, I&#8217;m an opium addict.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you sitting with old Pete? 
        Did the girlfriend get scared by your beauty and chase you away?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Fiance, and she&#8217;s very nice. Really, 
        really nice. I just wanted a little quiet, for the come-down, you know.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;When you&#8217;re young, those things don&#8217;t 
        last. You two were always such good friends. Those things, they don&#8217;t 
        last.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Emma shrugged in exasperation. &#8220;Sometimes 
        they do.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Come back to the party. If you&#8217;re 
        quick you can get a seat at the table. I think there&#8217;s a few people 
        up for seconds.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p></p>
      <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>The Piano-Forte</strong></font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> After dessert, the Bailey family had a lapsed 
        tradition of entertaining their remaining guests. The girls no longer 
        sang duets at the piano nor did they tapdance on the kitchen&#8217;s scratched 
        linoleum floor. Mr. Bailey no longer told his ghost stories now that he 
        himself was haunted. Mrs. Bailey had passed years ago, taking that tradition 
        with her. Naturally, Emma had not expected to see Cat directing the assembled 
        party into the garage where she had set up her synthesizer, laptop and 
        two battered microphones. &#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;We&#8217;re taking back the night.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Come on Em, for old time&#8217;s sake.&#8221; 
        Cat handed her a binder. &#8220;This is my song list.&#8221; Cat, frustrated 
        with her old bandmates, had started a one-woman karaoke band. &#8220;The 
        first gig didn&#8217;t go so good, just a couple of stoner chicks trying 
        to sing Journey. But I think once word gets around it&#8217;s gonna be 
        really fun. I&#8217;ve got some songs you can&#8217;t karaoke anywhere 
        else.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Did Dad put you up to this?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Does it matter?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Please.&#8221; Cat whined. &#8220;It&#8217;ll 
        make him happy. He could use a little happiness. Seriously, he&#8217;s 
        been a real dick since you&#8217;ve been gone.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Emma gulped what was left of her glass of wine 
        and poured another. &#8220;Might as well make some bad decisions.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> She grasped the microphone in one hand and her 
        wine glass in the other and sang a song by Feist that was a bit too big 
        for her. The song she sang was romantic and sensual, timeless and obscure. 
        It dipped above and below Emma&#8217;s limited range as a singer but the 
        tenderness and grace of her delivery excused some of her transgressions. 
        More and more guests trickled in to watch her, despite her faltering. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">As she sang, she scanned the room for a missing 
        face. Peter was not there. He was somewhere else with a very nice girl 
        who had never believed in anything with him more foolish than the holiness 
        of love. He was with a very nice girl somewhere who had never been a Ninja 
        Turtle with him, who had never sprinkled loose glitter on his head and 
        tried to fly. She was a very nice girl, but she had probably never seen 
        him eat a bug or cry over a skinned knee. For a moment, Emma managed to 
        pity her but the song ended. After all, Peter had hardly said more than 
        two words together to Emma that evening.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t so bad, was it?&#8221; 
        Cat teased.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Nah, just the singing part.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Emma squeezed through the crowd.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Who&#8217;s next?&#8221; Cat shouted. &#8220;Come 
        pick a song!&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">As Emma slipped through the crush Guy Leon caught 
        her arm. &#8220;Can I talk to you somewhere a little quieter?&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I&#8217;d rather you didn&#8217;t.&#8221; 
        She replied, wrenching her arm away.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> After the music, some gifts were exchanged. From 
        Cat to her father: a tie printed with a portrait of Karl Marx. From Emma 
        to Peter: a mix cd and a miniature Eiffel Tower. From Cat to Emma: a handmade 
        neon scarf. From Mr. Bailey to his daughters: an imposing stack of hardcover 
        books and a note promising the fun gifts would arrive on Christmas. From 
        Pauline to Emma: a framed set of two cards, the wax-wings and the swallows. 
        &#8220;Wax-wings, that you may fly close to the sun and swallows that 
        you may always have a home to return to.&#8221; From Emma to Cat: a set 
        of French-language day of the week underwear and a Hello Kitty watch. 
        From Guy Leon to Emma: in the morning she would find he had slipped in 
        the pocket of her cardigan a small tin containing an antique cameo pendant 
        buried beneath purple petals and a butterfly wing, wrapped in a note. 
        Hastily scrawled on a paper napkin it read, &#8220;You stopped answering 
        my emails and you don&#8217;t return my calls, but I want you to know 
        I am here for you always Emma Moonsparkle Bailey. Like it or not, I will 
        love you &#8216;til the day I die. Xoxo, Guy.&#8221; Emma would crumple 
        the note in her hand, crushed with a rage born of regret and longing despite 
        all Guy Leon had put her through. &#8220;It&#8217;s Moonshadow.&#8221; 
        She would whisper. &#8220;My middle name is Moonshadow.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Moonlight on the Moor</strong></font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Where Mr. Bailey sat at his kitchen table, the 
        cards were hanging directly over his head. He was alone with a glass of 
        whiskey, watching ice melt and studying the wood grain of the table. Somebody 
        had been looking at old photographs and left the album open in the front 
        of the chair next to his. He glanced at it for a second. He had found 
        if he looked at pictures only briefly they seemed alive, in motion. His 
        wife Jane was alive, was pregnant with Catherine. She was sitting on the 
        sofa with Emma. Emma&#8217;s hair was blond and curly still. She was five 
        years old and would not play with the baby doll he&#8217;d given her for 
        her birthday. Instead, she was writing her name with a crayon all over 
        a storybook. Sleeping Beauty. Emma, she wrote, Emma Emma Emma.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> She looked so much like Jane now. It was a shame 
        Peter wasn&#8217;t marrying Emma instead of that quiet little nameless 
        girl. It was a shame she hadn&#8217;t had a boyfriend for a long time. 
        He had hoped to have grandchildren by his age, to dote on and spoil. Perhaps 
        she was a lesbian. There was something strange about her. No, it wasn&#8217;t 
        that, couldn&#8217;t be that. He recalled her long-standing harmless flirtation 
        with his young colleague Guy Leon. Guy was an attractive young man, intelligent 
        and witty, maybe not so young for Emma though, Mr. Bailey considered. 
        Married too. He always forgot that woman. It was a shame.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">There was just nobody good enough for her. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Emma went downstairs with the intention of slipping 
        quietly out the kitchen door. It was just past midnight. Her father startled 
        her as much as she startled him. &#8220;Where are you going? I thought 
        you were tired.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I was just going out for a walk.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;It&#8217;s late.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Not in Paris.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;What time is it there?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, early?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">He gave her an indulgent smile. &#8220;Be careful. 
        Don&#8217;t stay out too late.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Emma heaved an exaggerated sigh. There was definitely 
        something strange about her. &#8220;Okay.&#8221; She said with an edge 
        to her voice. As she put on her coat, Mr. Bailey wondered if he could 
        even expect her to come home. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I love you.&#8221; He said, as she walked 
        out the door.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Love you too.&#8221; She snapped.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> It was an overcast, moonless night. Christmas 
        lights twinkled in the oak trees as if celebrating the absence of snow. 
        Emma listened to her i-pod as she walked, music playing in only one ear, 
        the other side of her earbuds dangling down the front of her coat. Her 
        knee ached slightly but she ignored it, continued walking. The wind blew 
        cold against her cheek. She buried her hands deep in her pockets and rubbed 
        them softly against the lining to warm them. A cat stalked down the sidewalk 
        in the other direction across the street from her. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Emma walked up the hill until she reached Indian 
        Rock at the top. It was a large rock formation about forty or fifty feet 
        high; she did not know why it was called &#8220;Indian&#8221; and she 
        pondered that old question again as she approached its dark form. Shallow 
        steps had been carved into one side to allow people to climb it. Emma 
        scrambled up the side in the dark, anxiously feeling her way. She was 
        afraid of running into someone homeless or half-crazy but still she climbed. 
        From the top of Indian Rock she could see all the way across the bay, 
        the city skyline and the Golden Gate stretching to Marin on one side of 
        the sky and streetlights and rooftops on the other. Emma sat, feeling 
        blank, wishing that the sun might never come up, that she might always 
        be above everything and alone.</font></p>
