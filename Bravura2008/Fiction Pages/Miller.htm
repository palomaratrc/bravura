      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><em>HAYDEN, Idaho- A man believed to be in his 
        twenties was hostpitalized last night after severing and then microwaving 
        his own hand. When ambulances arrived at the house, the young man had 
        lost consciousness due to blood loss. Authorities say they are unaware 
        of the reasoning behind such a tragic event and unsure if the victim had 
        any past history of mental illness. The man is currently in stable condition 
        at Kootenai Medical Hospital.</em></font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> The snow outside was masking the town in gray 
        haze as Russell watched from the couch. The violent wind kept smacking 
        the snow into the thin glass window in an annoying rhythm. Russell searched 
        the room for something else to do but finding nothing of interest came 
        to settle on the couch and landing on the dead TV screen. When was the 
        last time I paid the bill? These days the only thing that ever flickered 
        across the screen was the reflection of life inside his tiny trailer. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> A loud clatter followed by a meow startled him. 
        </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Mreow,&#8221; the trashcan seemed to say.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Pauly?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Mreow,&#8221; the garbage replied. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Russell reached in and rescued the gray tabby, 
        named after his favorite apostle. He loved that cat. It was always getting 
        into trouble and shed so much it&#8217;s a miracle the thing wasn&#8217;t 
        completely bald, but it was the only company Russell had in his lonely 
        trailer these days. As Pauly made his way up his arm, and Russell could 
        feel the cat purring as he returned to the couch. Russell returned his 
        gaze to the gray lifeless screen, but this time his mind couldn&#8217;t 
        wander. The snow wouldn&#8217;t let up. It just kept pounding on the window. 
        THUD thud THUD thud THUD thud THUD thud THUD. He was growing more anxious 
        and infuriated by the sound with each pound. THUD thud THUD.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> The phone rang, &#8220;Hello?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Good afternoon sir. How are you doing this 
        fine afternoon?&#8221; said the voice on the phone.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I&#8217;d be doing better if it wasn&#8217;t 
        snowing, who is this?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;My name is Luci from the cable company. 
        We wanted to inform you that you are now five months behind and late fees 
        are being added weekly. However, due to the impending blizzard&#8230;&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Blizzard?&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Russell had been getting prank calls all week 
        which he attributed to the snow. Kids had been out of school for a week 
        and a half now and were no doubt starving for entertainment. His favorite 
        had been the kid who asked if he had any fruit. When Russell replied no 
        the kid said, &#8220;You should get some, you know what they say, an apple 
        a day keeps the devil away.&#8221; And then he hung up. &#8220;That&#8217;s 
        what the weatherman is saying. Anyhow I&#8217;m calling to inform you 
        that with the dangerous weather ahead we will be reinstating one news 
        channel for you to keep you updated on the status of the storm, for emergency 
        purposes. When the storm has passed the channel will no longer be available 
        to you .&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Gee thanks.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Thanks for your time sir and we hope this 
        will help to ensure your safety, enjoy your afternoon and we look forward 
        to hearing from you soon. Goodbye.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Russell turned on the tube and surfed through 
        the channels. Nothing came but gray fuzz. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Russell chuckled to himself, Another prank call, 
        muted the TV sound off and let the static squirm all over the screen. 
        The rhythm of the snow was irregular now. The pattern was gone. Where 
        did it go? This is worse. Where&#8217;s the pattern? Russell searched 
        for some kind of format to the snow, but found none. Pauly sprawled out 
        on the coffee table, knocking over an unopened bottle of little green 
        pills that rattled as it fell to the floor. The frightened cat jumped 
        onto the couch next to Russell and hissed at the bottle. You&#8217;re 
        just having a day aren&#8217;t you cat? He picked up the pills and put 
        them back in their spot on the table. His gaze lingered on them for a 
        moment. He remembered the cute pharmacist who had filled the prescription 
        two weeks earlier&#8230; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> A brunette newswoman flashed onto the screen. 
        What the hell? </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Some people both religious and scientific 
        are saying the end may been sooner than we think Tom. Here is some footage 
        from last night, not in recorded history has the moon been such a brilliant 
        red before and people on both sides of the theological fence are in an 
        uproar. Some members of the church are claiming the return of Christ, 
        others are saying it&#8217;s the coming of the antichrist. Scientists 
        argue its due to global warming and that our atmosphere has changed the 
        appearance of the moon. No one knows for sure what caused the odd coloration 
        just yet, but scientists are investigating. Up next, Barbie&#8217;s famous 
        ex gets a makeover for the new generation.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;You know I always thought Barbie was a 
        tramp,&#8221; said Pauly, sitting up on his hind legs.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Me too my feline friend,&#8221; replied 
        the newswoman. &#8220;Me too.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Russell&#8217;s eyes widened. But, the cat.. And 
        the TV? But? He shut his eyes tight and shook his head, holding his ears. 
        Not now, not now. When he opened them the cat was laying next to him again, 
        sound asleep. The gray fuzz returned and the news was lost. Where did 
        it go? Russell glanced out at the Show which was now piled up to the window. 
        The cable lines must be out. The static from the speakers was almost unbearable 
        but he let it blare because it was better than the pounding of the snow 
        on the small window. The cat crawled into his lap and Russell scratched 
        it between the ears and closed his eyes. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> 'Hello Russell' said a familiar voice that sent 
        spiders of discomfort scurrying down Russell&#8217;s spine. As he opened 
        his eyes a saw the sinister creature emerge from the gray lines. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;Not now, 
        not now. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Have you looked in the mirror today Russ?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;What are you doing here? You are not supposed 
        to be here.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;It&#8217;s a simple question really,&#8221; 
        replied the voice, &#8220;Have you looked in the mirror today, or not?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Russell fidgeted and closed his eyes again. Shook 
        his head. I&#8217;m fine, it&#8217;s fine, I&#8217;m fine. The voice laughed 
        as Russell opened his eyes. The figure remained on the TV screen. Russell 
        shut his eyes ad rubbed them hard but the figure wouldn&#8217;t leave. 
        Go away go away go away &#8220;GO AWAY!&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Russell tried turning off the TV, turning off the 
        picture, the voice, but nothing happened. Damn it not now.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Oh for Fuck&#8217;s sake, why don&#8217;t 
        you just look in the God damned mirror Russ? You always do, save us both 
        the time and just look already.&#8221; The voice was angry now, irritated, 
        but it was also right. No matter how much Russell wanted to say no, he 
        always looked. Russell walked into the bathroom, not looking up, not yet, 
        studying the tiles on the floor. Then the base of the wall, the sink, 
        his toothbrush, the wooden frame, and finally his reflection in the mirror. 
        There, on his forehead were two sixes. He&#8217;d seen them before, but 
        they were always very faint, hard to see. This time was different. But 
        how, why now?</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;You&#8217;re missing something aren&#8217;t 
        you?&#8221; </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Am I?&#8221; </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;You are, but I&#8217;m certain you will 
        find it on that sinister little hand of yours.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Russell looked down at left hand and there on 
        the top of his skin was a six. It looked like a scar; like a six had been 
        burned into his skin and the raised remains were the six he saw. He could 
        feel his heart racing in his chest, beating faster and harder with every 
        quickening breath. He&#8217;d read about this, read about it many times. 
        The storm, the red moon, the sixes. He knew what was happening. He was 
        marked.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> The voice of the beast resonated through the small 
        trailer. &#8220;In just a matter of time, you will fulfill all the prophecies, 
        everything I told you about will unfold in a matter of days. Mankind will 
        never be the same and they&#8217;ll all have you to thank. Once that six 
        makes its way up your arm, through your heart and to your head, you will 
        become the ultimate evil, the antichrist.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Russell was unable to calm his breathing. Hyperventilating 
        and sure his heart was about to burst out of his chest, he was almost 
        dizzy his mind was spinning so fast. He thought about that cute pharmacist, 
        about his grandma. He remembered his little sisters and his mom. What&#8217;s 
        going to happen to them? I can&#8217;t. Not now. It can&#8217;t happen, 
        not to them, not to me. He had to get rid of that six. But how? How? </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> He ran to the kitchen sink and began scrubbing 
        his hand with the dish sponge, but nothing happened. Come on, COME ON! 
        He scrubbed harder but still nothing. He needed something more, something 
        better. There&#8217;s steel wool under the sink. He grabbed it and began 
        scrubbing, but the six remained. All he could sense was the six etched 
        into his hand. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;It will never come off, just give it up.&#8221; 
        The voice teased him from the television set. He glanced at Pauly for 
        some kind of something, anything, but the cat merely stared in confusion 
        at his frantic owner. Now you&#8217;re silent. Russell began trying every 
        cleanser in the house, dish soap, borax, bleach, none of it worked. He 
        tried burning it the top with a lighter, He winced as his skin melted 
        away but the six remained. Holy shit is it moving already? It was closer 
        to his wrist than when he first started scrubbing, not by much, but it 
        had moved. He needed to work faster. He didn&#8217;t have much time. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;That six will never leave your hand,&#8221; 
        the television smirked at him. The beast would not stop taunting him &#8220;as 
        long as you live that six will never leave your body.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Russell&#8217;s heart stopped. His breath froze 
        in his nostrils. If the six wouldn&#8217;t leave his hand, his hand would 
        have to leave his body. He understood now. It was clear. He sighed, relieved 
        as he set out for the garage. </font></p>
