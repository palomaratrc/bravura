    <td rowspan="28" align="left" valign="top"><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Story" --><font color="#FFFFFF">The 
      little boy remembered that he shot a seagull once. It had flown over the 
      two-story house and landed on top of the hammock his father had built but 
      rarely used. He was playing with his BB gun that day and it didn&#8217;t 
      take him long to decide to aim and pull the trigger. The bird dropped straight 
      to the ground. He waited as the early morning fog lingered over into the 
      afternoon. No one would be home for a while. He waited beside the bird as 
      the faint beat of a heart faded away. 
      <p> The next time he saw a seagull was when he was walking alone ahead of 
        everyone else. His mother had told him that he should never walk alone 
        in case something happened. It didn&#8217;t take him long to decide to 
        go off on his own. As he was walking through a clearing, a bird flew just 
        over his head and landed about thirty feet from where he was standing. 
        There was nothing unordinary about it except that it limped when it hopped. 
        His eyes focused as though he was looking through a sight of a gun. He 
        was initially confused by it. His mother told him that once everything 
        changed all the animals had died. The boy didn&#8217;t believe that. He 
        once believed that his father was the strongest man in the world, but 
        that changed too. </p>
      <p> He remembered the day the sun turned. It became dark, hidden behind 
        a veil of shadowy fog. Its dark maroon color changed the way everything 
        looked. He asked his mom about the sun and when it would get better. She 
        told him that when it was yellow again, everything would be okay again. 
        He believed her. He woke up to a world covered in darkness. His family 
        had left early in the morning and by the afternoon; the boy had become 
        an only child. The sounds of confusion and distress kept him from shutting 
        his eyes that night. Terrorists, monsters, aliens, they didn&#8217;t know 
        what has happening. The boy was scared of monsters. He thought there was 
        one under his bed when he was littler. At least then he could hide from 
        it under his covers. He wished he had brought them with him. He woke the 
        next morning to the sky exploding in a blast of color and light. The bright 
        orange color was hypnotic. No one could resist sending their eyes to the 
        sky. To the boy, it looked like a soul on its way to heaven. It wasn&#8217;t 
        just one soul; it was millions. He wondered if there were there any little 
        boys like him.</p>
      <p> His father was hurt by the time they started walking out of the city. 
        The boy couldn&#8217;t tell what hurt him. He just seemed hurt. They carried 
        him as long as they could. It only took a couple of hours before they 
        had to stop, the father losing every ounce of energy he had. They spent 
        a day on the side of the road trying to keep him awake. The next morning, 
        the boy and his mother woke up, but the father didn&#8217;t. The boy cried 
        for days; he thought fathers were supposed to protect their sons. His 
        never got around to it. By the afternoon, they had found another group 
        of travelers. The boy started to miss home. He missed his bed, his room, 
        and every little trinket inside it. He often wondered if he would see 
        it again. He wished he could hide under his covers.</p>
      <p> They spent the next few days wandering around looking for food. They 
        made their way through a town on the east side of a mountain range. It 
        wasn&#8217;t a big town, one of those former small American communities 
        cherished in the past. They walked down Main Street but didn&#8217;t find 
        anyone. They stumbled into a general store by midday. A few started to 
        eat anything that was in their path. The boy and his mother only ate canned 
        goods. A few people followed their example; it was apparent that they 
        all had seen the same movies</p>
      <p> For the next few weeks they made their way through the mountains. By 
        now there were only eight. Four didn&#8217;t wake up the morning after 
        they left the farming town. The boy&#8217;s mother told him that he food 
        made them sick. He didn&#8217;t know why food would make people sick. 
        At night they would set up tents that they borrowed from the general store. 
        They all agreed to make their way through the mountains. On the other 
        side was the ocean. At least, they hoped it was the ocean. </p>
      <p>It took two days to make it out of the mountains and by the time they 
        did, there were only five of them left. There was a man and his wife and 
        their young daughter. They didn&#8217;t speak much English so they often 
        just followed the boy and his mother without question. They found another 
        group a few days later. The boy was glad to find other people because 
        he found another little boy who he could play with. There were fifty or 
        sixty people huddled together near the side of the river. They were diverse: 
        the old, the young, even a newborn baby girl. The woman of the baby would 
        sometimes let the boy watch the baby girl when she had to help the group. 
        He liked the baby girl and she liked him.</p>
      <p>The boy would often get firewood for the group and when one time he found 
        his mother holding a gun down her throat. His hands trembled uncontrollably 
        as he pictured his mother aiming the gun at a flying bird. She would pull 
        the trigger and the bird would spiral to the ground. The sound of the 
        gun being loaded shook him. When he finally wrestled the weapon from her, 
        he ran out of the tent and threw the gun into a nearby river. It&#8217;s 
        silver color reflection caught his eyes as it struck the bottom. No one 
        would find it there. He didn&#8217;t know where she got the gun from, 
        but it didn&#8217;t matter. He wouldn&#8217;t see it again. He returned 
        to the tent to find his mother curled up in the corner. She didn&#8217;t 
        acknowledge him so walked over to her and nestled up next to her shivering 
        body. He felt the soft drip of tear fall on his face. He put his arms 
        around her and they both drifted off to sleep. </p>
      <p> It was near a grassy hill that the group found a wandering old man. 
        He had a long beard and narrow, piercing eyes. He smelled of ash and rotten 
        food. It was clear that he had been alone for a very long time. He said 
        he was preacher that had come from God to rescue everyone. The boy would 
        watch from far off, as the rest of the group would listen like little 
        sheep. Afterwards, they would praise him with food and drink. The boy 
        never offered his meals. </p>
      <p> The man would preach of sinning and repentance. The boy would listen, 
        barely able to understand the words that the old man was using. His voice 
        would boom from the top of the hill, his words echoing far beyond the 
        ears of the weary listeners. A few people turned away from the man and 
        his preaching. The rest would take everything he said as if it was sent 
        down from heaven. </p>
      <p> It was after the fifth night of listening to the preacher that the boy 
        went to his mother. &#8220;Mom, the man says that God did this and that 
        he is punishing us,&#8221; he said, his mother listening.</p>
      </font>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I thought that God loved us,&#8221; the 
        boy continued.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> She didn&#8217;t respond.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;If God loves us, why would he let this 
        happen?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Her face was still. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> During night, the boy felt a breeze as if it came 
        from the ocean. He thought he could smell the salty smell of the Pacific, 
        but he wasn&#8217;t sure if it was just his imagination. He jumped as 
        a loud pop rang through the camp. A moment later he watched as three men 
        carried something through the darkness. They came up to him and dropped 
        something at his feet: the old man. Blood dripped from his chest and mixed 
        with the dirt. The boy watched as one of the men stuck a silver plated 
        pistol in his belt. He then went back to his tent and lay down next to 
        his mother. He didn&#8217;t dare wake her. He shut his eyes and waited 
        for the sleep to overtake him.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> It was the next day that he went ahead of the 
        group. His night was filled with images of the old man. He hoped he would 
        forget him, but he knew he wouldn&#8217;t. The clearing was just far enough 
        so he could see the camp. He watched silently as the bird hopped around 
        on its one good leg looking for food. He just wanted to watch it, to admire 
        it. He moved just a little bit and the bird took off into the sky. He 
        waited there in solace as the bird took off, its body silhouetted against 
        a yellow sun. </font><br>
