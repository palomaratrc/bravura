      a police officer for several years now, many real life scenes have been 
      presented to me that would make the average person ill or sad beyond belief. 
      I have performed CPR on over twenty people and watched as most of those 
      slowly drift to the other side. I have responded to multiple car crashes 
      where death is the main theme and I could do nothing but watch surviving 
      family member&#8217;s lives change before my eyes. I have seen a human burned 
      to such an unrecognizable point that the medical examiner had to tell me 
      the still smoldering unknown person was a Jane or John Doe. Many of these 
      events have little effect on me. You learn to detach yourself from the scene 
      and just perform your job, thinking of the subjects as fake, unreal corpse, 
      instead of lifeless human bodies with a history, a family, and for many 
      people, a new memory to hold on to. 
      <p>One event in particular really had an effect on me, those lasting images 
        sticking in my mind to this day. It was a cool night, the sun had recently 
        retired and I was out of my normal area, assisting other officers who 
        were looking for a lost child. I was rolling through the main arteries 
        that divide the city looking for a nine year old that matched the description 
        when the news came across the radio that the lost boy was located. He 
        was found within the apartment complex, as they usually are, wandering 
        around exploring his curious mind. I advised dispatch that I was clear 
        from this call and began heading back downtown to my familiar streets 
        and hoods that I have been working for the past three years. The evening 
        was cooling off fast and thoughts of coffee began to cross my mind as 
        I neared a gas station where I used to always stop by and say hi to James, 
        the overweight clerk who was always trying to obtain legal advice from 
        me. He may not have been the greatest and most productive citizen in the 
        city, but I didn&#8217;t care, for he always kept fresh coffee and clean 
        bathrooms. As I approached my old resting stop, the silence was broken 
        by the crack of my radio. &#8220;All units, serious injury collision, 
        vehicle versus pedestrian. Two year old child down in the roadway. Cedar 
        and Lewis. Unit to clear and be in route code 3?&#8221; </p>
      <p>I knew exactly where the intersection was and knowing I was the closest 
        unit, I gave my unit designator and advised dispatch I was in route. My 
        bright red and blue lights shined like the sun, cutting through the dark 
        evening, and my siren sounded deafeningly, breaking the every day sounds 
        as the city drifted towards sleep. I was a one man light show as I sped 
        towards my unwanted destination, clearing intersections and honking my 
        air horn impatiently as vehicles slowly pulled to the right. As I rounded 
        my last corner, I could already see the scene, right across the street 
        from a large park. People were already gathering to see what the commotion 
        was all about. I pulled up in the dark night and the strobes from my light 
        bar illuminated people&#8217;s faces in rapid succession. The overall 
        appearance on the crowd that flashed before me seemed cheerless and heartbreaking. 
        What was I about to get into? </p>
      <p>I grabbed my undersized first aid bag that contained a few bandages and 
        a CPR mask and walked into the heart of the crowd whose attention had 
        been focused towards the street. As I approached, the distraught looks 
        shifted towards me and a very small light of hope flickered in few of 
        the eyes. As the crowd began moving back in compliance to my orders, I 
        saw what had previously trapped their attention. On the ground lay the 
        small motionless body of a two year old boy, his empty eyes staring past 
        the dotted sky as if focusing on some unseen object. His shoeless feet 
        were being held by a man in his forties, sobbing quietly as he hunched 
        over his son, praying softly. His body twitched gently from each weep 
        of pain and sorrow as he continued to beg for help, for strength, for 
        hope. His dark head looked up to the heavens as if to be heard more clearly 
        as he continued to whisper. I could see tears falling gracefully from 
        his eyes, flashing blue and red from each spin of my vehicles strobes. 
        My thoughts were suddenly torn as I realized the heartbroken father was 
        staring at me, looking deep into my eyes and begging for help. I quickly 
        knelt down beside the boy and my training took over. I accessed his breathing 
        and pulse, both of which were absent. After grabbing my CPR mask, I placed 
        the oversized barrier awkwardly on the boy&#8217;s mouth and gave him 
        two puffs of life. His chest did not rise. After readjusting his jaw, 
        I tried again with the same results. I began giving compressions and as 
        I worked the chest of this lifeless two year old, I remember seeing people 
        gather around as if watching in hope. The many eyes attentive to my actions 
        gave me strength and I continued on. Life was still being restricted from 
        entering his small lungs. I grabbed my flashlight and looked deep into 
        the boy&#8217;s dark mouth and discovered blood and teeth as the blockage. 
        I gently rolled the small torso onto his side to sweep the mouth and attempt 
        to unclog the petite airway. As I supported the head with my right hand 
        I felt something sharp poke my palm. I shifted the gaze of my flashlight 
        and my stomach dropped as reality hit. Illuminated before me was what 
        we call an obvious death. Looking up through a shattered skull was the 
        young child&#8217;s core makeup. I had seen brains before, but my freshly 
        destroyed hope made this difficult to see. The sharpened point I had felt 
        was a piece of a recently destroyed skull, a skull that only moments before 
        housed life.</p>
      </font>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Paramedics arrived on scene just as I made my discovery 
        and pronounced the boy dead. The few short moments I had been on scene 
        seemed like hours, long, lonely hours. We covered the lifeless body and 
        began our investigation. Immediately, my thoughts drifted to my own children, 
        unable to imagine what this father must be experiencing. You learn from 
        everything you experience, however on that day the lessons presented to 
        me created a much larger impact. When is being late and driving too fast 
        worth taking a life? Not just the life of the child, but the lives of 
        the father and his family will be forever changed. I have never taken 
        a life in this way and never want to experience the guilt the driver had 
        just surprisingly adopted. I also learned to keep my children close, not 
        just physically, but emotionally. Should the terrifying and unfortunate 
        event happen to me and the life of my child is taken, my only hope is 
        there is no regret in our relationship and nothing is left unsaid. For 
        now, I will live, and I will continue to learn.</font><br>
