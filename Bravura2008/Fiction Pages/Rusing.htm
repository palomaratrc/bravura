      was in the kitchen making guacamole with avocados Ivy and I had collected 
      that morning, he carefully checked their ripeness choosing only the best 
      three, her Father was very particular. Ivy put slightly stale, blue corn 
      chips on the table; the three of us ate our snack. Paul was wearing a mustache, 
      Ivy said he always wore one in the fall, it was graying much more quickly 
      then the little hair he had left atop his head. So different than my own 
      Father, pale, weak maybe. From the pottery room the smell of Nag Champa 
      lingered with the sounds of Ivy&#8217;s Mother, Lilly. The wheeling of clay 
      with worn hands and light-footed peddling danced off the adobe walls. She 
      was beauty, a vision of lightness through her dark complexion, soft spoken; 
      Paul&#8217;s wife even to fault. Ivy asked me to spin with her, spin until 
      we fall. Above all, I took direction well I trusted her. Ivy and I held 
      hands, we spun until our hearts beat so loudly even the coyotes stopped 
      to listen. &#8220;They only hunt at night,&#8221; Paul said. He watched 
      our spinning. He admired the way we loved each other, without condition, 
      and without the harshness our adulthoods would grant us. 
      <p>Her ebony hair falls in folds across her face as we spin, our clasped 
        hands become one, my light, Caucasian skin creased into her darker French 
        exterior. We made quite the pair. Laughing more than breathing I asked 
        Paul, &#8220;Can we play on the hill, alone, if we promise to come home 
        before dark?</p>
      <p>He smiled widely, &#8220;Alone, and what sort of mischief are you girls 
        up to?</p>
      <p>&#8220;Dad, we&#8217;re fine and were going, anyway if we wanted to cast 
        spells on you we&#8217;d need Mom&#8217;s help--------&#8221;, I grabbed 
        her mouth, finishing their talk and walking her toward the door.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Stay for dinner, stay the night even, I&#8217;ll call your Father,&#8221; 
        Paul graciously offered, I watched him reach for the phone as I stepped 
        outside. We ran under the tangerine trees to catch our breath and to be 
        out any ones sight. </p>
      <p>&#8220;Stay the night,&#8221; Ivy mocked, &#8220;maybe you should&#8217;ve 
        been his daughter&#8220;, then her eyes left her and she quickly lost 
        her smile. I took her hand in mine, blew a kiss toward the house and tried 
        standing up.</p>
      <p>When the spinning feeling in our heads finally stopped I followed Ivy 
        into the field that separated our homes. From where we stood I could see 
        my horses; Jack was gnawing at his salt block and Peewee rubbed his neck 
        along the aluminum corral whinnying with approval. Pepper Trees, some 
        oak, small brush, grasses, wild flowers and plenty of weeds littered our 
        field and played host to a variety of creatures. We walked up Fiona&#8217;s 
        hill, to our swing. It wasn&#8217;t really named, but that&#8217;s what 
        Paul called it. In the summer yellow Mims crawled up the hill, like blonde 
        hair laying softly on shoulders, at least that&#8217;s what he told us. 
        He probably had blonde hair once, like mine, sandy but much lighter for 
        the summer. Ivy went first. Ivy always went first. She grabbed the old 
        rope and ran up quite a ways, sending field mice running in all directions, 
        to jump just a little further than the time before. With one step, by 
        will of the rope, her body descended over Fiona&#8216;s hill, as she called 
        to the coyote. Answering back was only the birds, cawing blue jays, cooing 
        doves and the barely audible vibrations of the humming kind. When it was 
        my turn, old rope in hand I exceeded only half the distance Ivy had. I 
        was never one for bruised knees. As I passed through soft limbs and leaves 
        of the Pepper tree, I caught our names carved into the trunk, &#8220;don&#8217;t 
        lose me, Ivy &amp; Jane&#8221;. Paul had done it for us a few summers 
        ago, early summer I remember because thousands of butterflies came to 
        the field, but were gone as quick has they had come, we must have been 
        eight then. Lilly always says it&#8217;s important never to lose each 
        other and stay together for the most part. In this field, the coyote can 
        sense those going at it alone, it&#8217;s who they prey on.</p>
      <p>We walked slowly to her home just before the night swallowed day, and 
        the animals found their beds. Wild mustard grass brushed our bare legs, 
        and splinters filled our sandals. Paul, who never seemed to leave the 
        kitchen, was watching in our direction when we opened the gate. Relief, 
        or maybe joy washed over his face through the kitchen window. I smiled 
        in his shadow, I didn&#8217;t think he saw. But when we came through the 
        kitchen he let his arm brush mine, we sat at the table. Dinner was ready; 
        curry with white rice and sliced papaya. The house was dimly lit, our 
        candles smoked crude fat oils, the flames tickled our faces, we watched 
        what we created slowly drip hot wax onto the wooden table. Lilly left 
        her wheel and retired the pottery room for the night; she folded laundry 
        she had taken from the line outside. The house smelled of olive oil now, 
        and a Rolling Stones tune, Angie, played softly over the water running 
        in the sink. I picked at my curry, ridding it of water chestnuts. Paul 
        just smiled softly not knowing his mustache was painted yellow, cumin 
        stains, he looked almost young without the gray.</p>
      <p>After dinner Ivy and I took a bath. Lilly filled our tub sprinkling lavender 
        salts into the warm water. The salts dispersed under my feet as I stepped 
        in. Ivy sang French songs I could not understand. When she washed my hair, 
        shampoo fell into my eyes and I plunged my head in. Lying on our backs 
        at opposite ends of the tub we measured our feet against each other&#8217;s. 
        Ivy had long slender toes, but her foot itself was very flat. My toes 
        were shorter and wider, the sole of my foot was deeply arched. Lilly said 
        that between us we&#8217;d make quite the ballet dancer. &#8220;You&#8217;re 
        lucky,&#8221; she also told me, when you become a woman your feet will 
        welcome high heels, they slender your calves you know,&#8221;. I didn&#8217;t 
        care for high heels or the idea of becoming a woman. I washed Ivy&#8217;s 
        back with a sea sponge. </p>
      <p>After our bath, Lilly let us wear her French silk slips. They fit us 
        like ball gowns. I wished in that moment, that she was my Mother with 
        her soft spoken, lightness. Watching, Paul says, &#8220;You will make 
        even the most beautiful women cringe with envy when grown,&#8221;. He 
        watched Lilly&#8217;s face looking for approval, she only cringed, not 
        at us of course but at the sound of coyote&#8217;s catching a kill outside. 
        I didn&#8217;t want to be a woman; I felt contentment in my small world 
        of whimsy and self amusement. Toad spit to cure the tummy ache from too 
        many tangerines and blue belly lizard tales to ward off coyote. </p>
      <p>Ivy and I draw for the coyote, appease them, pray on their vanity, we&#8217;ll 
        post them along the fence. We rubbed pastels roughly over hand made paper 
        and the sound has never left my mind. Ivy yawned deeply and Lilly put 
        her to bed. &#8220;Since you are not as tired as Ivy would you like to 
        watch television?&#8221;, I only nodded my head, not really sure yet. 
        I laid alone on what seemed a stage, but was their living room. Paul and 
        Lilly kept no couch, so they made a bed of Indian print pillows for me, 
        I had fallen asleep there many times. The Smurfs and their little village 
        filled the television screen and my mind as I drifted to sleep. </p>
      <p>My dreams that night were not as beautiful as the day, I wrestled only 
        dozing quietly in and out of sleep. Later into the night I heard Lilly 
        leave the house, she was headed for her shed. She hid sweet smelling cigarettes 
        in a rusted coffee tin, we weren&#8217;t supposed to know. Sadly the gentleness 
        and radiance of the house followed Ivy, it was far more tricky sleeping 
        in this harsh darkness. But sleep came again, followed by dreamily sounding 
        foot steps; less light, more shadows. Awakened once more, I found myself 
        in the company of Paul. I didn&#8217;t want to be a woman. But despite 
        my wants, he softly asked me not to move and told me, &#8220; If you say 
        a word or even breathe too loudly the coyote will come,&#8221;. I was 
        always good at following directions. So I lay there, painfully enduring 
        but surviving this night raid. His mustache brushed my bare legs and his 
        hot breath found itself between my thighs. I smell the sweetness of Lilly&#8217;s 
        smoke, concentrate on her warmth, the light. Paul found himself inside 
        me; I&#8217;m flushed with water, embarrassed I pissed myself, I can&#8217;t 
        look up, then left he me. Inside, outside, inside, outside finding his 
        slow rhythm and tearing me open. He left me one last time, but not until 
        his satisfaction had come and my eyes were left overflowing with the moisture 
        of fear. When it was over Paul lay atop me, stroking my hair and shushing 
        my gentle sobs.</p>
      <p>When I was alone and sure he was asleep, I ran. I ran from the smell 
        of olive oil and the memory of pastel rubbing hand made paper, my fear 
        overwhelming my good sense and the presence of the coyote. Don&#8217;t 
        lose me, I begged my broken body, but I was already on the ground. I hadn&#8217;t 
        quite reached the field when the first howl let out, then all too soon 
        the others followed; my pain and tears were paralyzed. The night seemed 
        to play along with the coyote&#8217;s anxious song, the wind&#8217;s soft 
        lull and my horses&#8217; nervous whinnying made with their melody. Then 
        I, too, intoned a song, the quickened pace of my heart, incessant throbbing 
        of my pain and the breath I lost beneath him, played in the blues. </p>
      <p>I lay under a moonlit, cloudless sky somewhere between my home and the 
        nightmarish, wood paneling separating me from Paul. The coyotes surrounded 
        me, growling under their breath and moving unhurriedly toward me. I force 
        my body up, splinters breaking the soft skin on the pads of my feet. The 
        coyotes just waited. I shouted, hoping to frighten them, but he just moved 
        in closer. Their leader, bringer of life and the first to stun the kill, 
        watched me. I shut my eyes afraid they would meet his; and began to beseech 
        someone, anyone to wake me. I felt the soft breath and wet nose of him 
        on my legs.</p>
      </font>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Coyote shivered he smelt my nightmare and tasted 
        the blood from it. I opened my eyes and was without help, but so was he. 
        His pack left him. We found ourselves alone, but also somehow bound together 
        that night in our field. It was in that very moment and Paul&#8217;s slaughtering 
        of my purity; I never again feared the coyote. </font><br>
