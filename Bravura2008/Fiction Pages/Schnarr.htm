      <p>&#8220;<font color="#FFFFFF">Life is just filthy water, mucked up with 
        guilt, goin&#8217; down the drain.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> My grandfather said this before he died. With 
        his last breath he uttered the word, &#8220;gravestone.&#8221; No one 
        else understood, but I did. I didn&#8217;t know why that was the last 
        sentence out of his mouth, but I knew why he said gravestone.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> They didn&#8217;t believe me. Stood to reason, 
        I was the least favorite of the grandchildren. At the funeral my Aunt 
        Jane read the eulogy. At the end of it, she began to name off the beloved 
        family of my Grandfather; my name wasn&#8217;t in there. The dog, Spike, 
        even Spike was on that list. If the cat hadn&#8217;t been run over by 
        my grandmother, may she rest in peace; it would have been on the list 
        as well.<br>
        <br>
        After the coffin was lowered into the ground everyone put a shovel scoop&#8217;s 
        worth of dirt over it. By the time it was my turn, the dirt pile next 
        to the grave was nothing more than matted splotches between blades of 
        grass; this closely resembled my feelings of &#8220;compassion&#8221; 
        towards my family; I kept the shovel.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> After everyone piled into their limousines they 
        went to the after party. Modern day mourning only exists with a hangover; 
        or cocktail shrimps and the like. I didn&#8217;t bother going, I slept 
        in the car; I needed all the sleep I could get before sunset.</font></p>

        <em><strong>An excerpt from the Encyclopedia</strong><br>
        <br>
        The first zombie to be recorded in history could technically be marked 
        down as Lazarus, or maybe even Jesus Christ. But it was in fact, Mark 
        Twain. No one knew he was actually buried beneath a New Orleans river 
        bend Caf&eacute;. He was, and it nearly startled an English Major student 
        to death when he popped out from underneath his table.<br>
        Mark Twain pulled himself from the earth partially decayed, and in a dirty 
        suit. He dusted himself off and pulled a cigar from the mouth of a passing 
        sophisticate; who, in turn, lit a match for Mr. Twain and pulled another 
        cigar out for himself.<br>
        Seeing as George A. Romero had not yet made his documentaries of the undead 
        no one knew what to expect; they certainly didn&#8217;t expect this as 
        it at all.<br>
        Mark Twain took a puff, looked at the English Major, and said something 
        about the lack of humanity in consuming human flesh; something about alcohol 
        being the answer, and flesh and blood being the path to destruction.<br>
        &#8220;I was conceived before my parents were actually married,&#8221; 
        he blew smoke out, and enjoyed its taste. &#8220;I was born before the 
        doc said I would be.&#8221; He collapsed into the chair behind him and 
        sighed, &#8220;so, it stands to reason that I&#8217;d come back a few 
        years before a certain day of apocalyptic proportions.&#8221; He went 
        on, but everyone remembered he was dead and paid no attention.<br>
        He put the cigar in the shocked English Major&#8217;s open mouth, patted 
        his cheek, and re-entered the cold earth. He buried himself and never 
        returned; he didn&#8217;t see immortality worth it enough to come back.</em></font></p>

      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
        That night</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
        I stared at the mobile above my bed; little woodland critters hand carved 
        from maple wood. I always liked watching the badger. I would make stories 
        up in my head as a child, he was always the hero. He was always strong 
        and courageous; that&#8217;s what I needed to be that night.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> I had to leave. I would tell my parents what I 
        planned to, but my father would respond as most fathers would: &#8220;It&#8217;s 
        past eight, sport, the dead have risen. We&#8217;ll go out in the morning 
        and throw the ol&#8217;pigskin around.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> It couldn&#8217;t wait till morning. It needed 
        to be done that night. I quickly made a martini, dropped an olive in it 
        and rushed out the door shovel in hand. My grandfather made a chisel from 
        the lower half of a railroad spike, sharpened and placed in a handle carved 
        from oak; total, it was about a foot and half long. It was neatly crafted 
        into the head of a stag, and spread with dark varnish. It hung diagonally 
        from the back of my belt.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> I placed the martini by a large crack in our wooden 
        fence, the last defense against the undead. I jumped the fence and reached 
        through the crack for the martini. I turned around. I stared at all the 
        grave stones; the entire countryside had become a graveyard. We don&#8217;t 
        really need the land for much else; mankind hadn&#8217;t left their houses 
        for a few decades; mainly during the night. At night the grass would become 
        dark green, almost black. The night sky would be smothered in dark grey 
        clouds, clear enough to let the moonlight seep through.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> I made my way to a gravestone labeled: &#8220;C.G.&#8221; 
        I put the martini on top of it, and a hand with a maroon satin sleeve 
        reached through the ground and grabbed at my ankle. I put the handle of 
        the shovel out for it to get a grip on.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> It grabbed it and I pulled out the revived cadaver 
        of Cary Grant from his grave. He shook the dirt off of his maroon satin 
        smoking jacket, burgundy silk pajamas, and slick dark brown slippers. 
        He grabbed the martini, sipped at it, and looked at me.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> He still spoke like he had cotton balls in his 
        mouth; but he was completely discernable. &#8220;Thank you, it&#8217;s 
        a little dry down there.&#8221; I loved the way he pronounced everything 
        phonetically, thought out, yet fast and witty.<br>
        <br>
        &#8220;It&#8217;s no problem Mr. Grant, really. It&#8217;s my pleasure.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Cary, come-on, call me Cary.&#8221; He&#8217;d 
        told me a thousand times but I knew he loved to say it. &#8220;How&#8217;s 
        the night so far?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;It&#8217;s okay I guess, I have to chop 
        my grandfather&#8217;s head off.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> He nearly choked on his drink, rubbed his throat, 
        and stared at nothing in particular and then at me. &#8220;Charming.&#8221; 
        I shrugged; he put a fake smile on. &#8220;Come on, kid, don&#8217;t go 
        losing your head!&#8221; He slouched over and pointed at me with an open 
        mouthed smile, he made a goofy laugh and hoped I&#8217;d return it; I 
        didn&#8217;t, I started walking.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;It has to be done, plus, I owe him a favor.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> I walked past him. He was spaced out, again staring 
        at nothing in particular. He realized I was a few gravestones away. &#8220;Can 
        I walk with you?&#8221; He shouted to me. I shrugged and kept walking. 
        He ran after me, making sure not to spill his drink. &#8220;What do you 
        say to a little company?&#8221; He took a sip and swallowed. He looked 
        at my shovel. &#8220;Why do you do it?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;My grandfather did it, and I&#8217;m the 
        only one that understands why.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Well, why?&#8221; He finished off the drink 
        and ate the olive, grunting with satisfaction.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Well I--&#8220;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> He stopped me in my tracks. &#8220;You mount the 
        head&#8217;s of the undead on your living room wall.&#8221; He smiled 
        at his own genius, and slapped his hands together; he started making vocal 
        music, &#8220;yah duh, dah dah&#8230;&#8221; and dancing in place. He 
        stopped and looked at me, I was unimpressed, and not completely in the 
        mood. He giggled, &#8220;Oh, no-no-no, go on.&#8221; I quirked an eyebrow, 
        he kept encouraging me. &#8220;Go on, go on.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;We can&#8217;t stop it from happening, 
        but we can keep the ones we love where they should be.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;In the grave&#8230;&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;At peace.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> We started walking again. He looked at me, &#8220;why 
        haven&#8217;t you killed me?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> I stared at him through the corner of my eyes. 
        &#8220;Yet.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> He stopped in his tracks and stared blankly ahead.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Kidding.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> He gave me a sincere look, and his mouth cracked 
        into a whimsical smile. &#8220;Aahhh, you got me. That was good.&#8221; 
        He chuckled. &#8220;That was good.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> I hid a smile. &#8220;What was your life like 
        before I gave you a martini?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;My formula for living was simple. I got 
        out of my grave at night, and buried myself again in the morning. In between, 
        I occupied myself as best I could.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Did you eat human flesh?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I tried it once; it tasted like bad apples&#8230;no&#8230;&#8221; 
        He laughed to himself, &#8220;worse, it tasted like Hitchcock&#8217;s 
        pasta.&#8221; I took it that Hitchcock didn&#8217;t make very good pasta. 
        He stopped laughing, but kept smiling. &#8220;Why&#8217;d you put the 
        martini on my gravestone all those years ago?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I was young, and I 
        didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d like human blood very much.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Granted.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d like something with 
        a little more class.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> He made a high pitched &#8220;hmmm&#8221;.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Truth be told, I didn&#8217;t have the slightest 
        idea what the martinis were actually doing to him</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> <em><strong>Undead Science</strong><br>
        <strong>Emotion: </strong><br>
        As we all know an intense and sudden burst of emotion causes the undead 
        to become mindless killers. Often it is the sight of a loved one that 
        sets them off:<br>
        1. They will begin to think of the past with much regret and frustration.<br>
        2. The rush of emotion via memories fries the brain along with the entire 
        central nervous system.<br>
        3. This will cause them to twitch and groan: Mental and physical pain.<br>
        4. They will begin to breathe heavy as all emotions dissolve into a mindless 
        rage.<br>
        5. When their eyes are completely dilated you will know that they have 
        become primal.</em></font></p>
      <p><em><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Alcohol:</strong><br>
        The dehydrating effects of alcohol mixed with the oily nature of olives 
        create a stasis within the undead. Their skin becomes as alive as it can 
        possibly be. The mind stays dry and cool; i.e. level headed.<br>
        Human flesh will no longer be a craving; only conversation and company 
        become desirable; this would in theory lead to very classy, very entertaining 
        cocktail parties; again, in theory.</font></em></p>

      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> I sighed, and sat against the side of the gravestone; 
        I would wait for him. Cary sat down next to me and twiddled his thumbs 
        for a few minutes. He finally leaned against me and started pointing towards 
        the ground. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go.&#8221; He looked at me, and I tried 
        not to cry. &#8220;We&#8217;ll walk around the lake, there&#8217;s a guy 
        down there who makes a mean--you&#8217;d---you&#8217;d&#8230;&#8221; He 
        sighed, &#8220;no&#8230;you --you wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221; He left me in 
        silence and looked around the area for something adventurous to distract 
        me.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> He was too late.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> The ground began to move. My grandfather&#8217;s 
        hand reached through the dirt. I put the shovel&#8217;s handle out for 
        him to grab, and I pulled him out; I left his legs in the ground. He brushed 
        the earth off his suit as looked up at me. Though I doubted it at the 
        time, I swear I saw tears in his eyes.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I knew you&#8217;d come.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Usually I&#8217;d just take the shovel to their 
        neck and call it a night, but I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to do it yet. 
        I just stared at him, holding back tears, vulgarity, hiding my heart beat. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> He was growing impatient. &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t 
        you--&#8220;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> I interrupted him, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t--?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Cary popped up from behind the grave and looked 
        at my Grandfather, and then me; he became very serious. &#8220;This is 
        a personal moment isn&#8217;t it&#8230;I&#8217;ll just mosey on over to 
        the willow.&#8221; He nodded to me, &#8220;I&#8217;ll see you in a bit.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> My grandfather was biting his lower lip; sad, 
        and frustrated.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> I repeated the question. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t 
        you love me?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> He punched the grass. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t love 
        you?!&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> I was surprised by his reaction.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Of all of them, I loved you the most!&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> I thought of my grandmother, and when I had done 
        the same to her. &#8220;But grandma&#8230;you--&#8220;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;You did what I couldn&#8217;t bring myself 
        to do.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;You never--&#8220;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;The minute she stopped breathing, I stopped 
        trying to live.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;&#8230;they all hate me.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Tears began to fall from his eyes. &#8220;They 
        hated that only you had my respect.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I just&#8230;I felt neglected when you 
        were alive, and now I&#8230;&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Look--&#8220;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> I fell to the ground and rested my head on his 
        shoulders; I let his suit soak up my tears. &#8220;I feel so alone.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> He was hesitant at first, but he put his arms 
        around me. &#8220;For what it&#8217;s worth, I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221; I 
        backed up and sat in front of him. &#8220;Towards the end I only grumbled 
        about the times, predicting the rise and falls of empires&#8230;but I 
        saw what they were doing to you, and did nothing to stop it.&#8221; He 
        started shivering. &#8220;I wanted to, but--&#8220; His neck started twitching. 
        &#8220;Forgive--forgive me. All that--.&#8221; His eyes began to dilate.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> I stood up with the shovel, ready to swing.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> He hit the ground with both hands, and composed 
        himself. He strained to speak once more as himself. &#8220;Love! Without 
        Love there is no hope!&#8221; Blood red tears began to fall from his eyes. 
        &#8220;Hope through Love&#8230;&#8221; He breathed heavy, &#8220;Love&#8230;with 
        hope&#8230;&#8221; His words melted into a groan, and his eyes grew dark. 
        He began to salivate and I knew it was time.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I love you.&#8221; I brought the shovel 
        down across his neck swiftly. He went limp as his head fell to the ground. 
        I fell to my hands and knees punching the ground repeatedly, and screaming 
        to the sky. I wiped the tears from my eyes and began to put my grandfather 
        back into his grave.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Cary waited by the willow tree like he said he 
        would. He saw me walking back dragging my shovel behind me. He rushed 
        over to me, and awkwardly patted my back; he couldn&#8217;t completely 
        decide between hugging me, or just patting my back and his arms showed 
        it. &#8220;There, there. It&#8217;ll be okay.&#8221; He brought my chin 
        up and smiled, hoping he could get me to do the same.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> I smiled, and put my arm around his shoulder. 
        &#8220;Suns almost up Cary, time for bed.&#8221; I walked him back to 
        his gravestone.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;You did good, kid. You did good.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> He returned to his grave and I went to bed. I 
        woke up and I could tell by the look on my father&#8217;s face that he 
        knew what I had done.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> I fulfilled my grandfather&#8217;s last wish.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Upon the gravestone was now engraved:</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;<em>Life is just fil-<br>
        Hope through love<br>
        Love with hope&#8221;</em></font></p>
