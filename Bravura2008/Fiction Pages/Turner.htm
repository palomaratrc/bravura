      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> The man behind the counter sighed. He had pit 
        stains and yellow teeth.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I know I know&#8212;But I&#8217;m nervous. 
        I mean, we&#8217;re in the Everglades aren&#8217;t we?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;The &#8216;glades are about two-hundred 
        miles South o' here.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;There&#8217;s still gators aren&#8217;t 
        there?&#8217; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;&#8217;Course there&#8217;s gators.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;So I could be eaten&#8212;&#8220;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;The chances are mighty slim, sir.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;But there&#8217;s a chance?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;There&#8217;s always a chance. But gators 
        don&#8217;t like a whole heap o&#8217; noise, and there be so many people 
        driftin&#8217; down this river blarin&#8217; music and bein&#8217; rowdy 
        each and every day that no gator&#8217;ll come within a dozen miles.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> I felt better. &#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Now that&#8217;ll be thirty-two even for 
        the two o' ya.&#8221; I handed him a credit card. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Y'all of age?&#8221; We nodded. &#8220;I 
        suggest buyin&#8217; some beer if you don&#8217;t got any already. It&#8217;s 
        'bout a four hour trip from beginning to end, and it&#8217;s mighty hot 
        outside.&#8221; His breath reeked of stale beer.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> We bought two six packs and walked outside. The 
        heat hit my body like a wrecking ball and the humidity was salty on my 
        lips. I had no idea how people managed to live in this kind of heat. The 
        kind of heat that makes a man want nothing more than to kill himself on 
        the outside chance that he won't go to hell. We walked along and shielded 
        our eyes from the glare of the white-hot asphalt as we crossed the parking 
        lot towards her car. I put my hand around her waist and everything was 
        ok. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Her name was Cassy. I think it was short for Cassandra 
        but I never asked. Maybe it was Cassidy. I met her a few days earlier 
        in Atlanta; she was in town for a Cat Power show and I had just come down 
        from Baltimore. She lured me in with her tight body and talk of the &#8220;real 
        South&#8221;, and next thing I knew I had been down through Savannah, 
        on past St. Augustine and ended up in her apartment in Gainesville. She 
        had green eyes and her wavy hair had been stripped of color so many times 
        that I thought it would glow in the dark. Her Father used to beat her 
        and her Mother died when she was three and her only sibling had Autism&#8212;or 
        Palsy, I can&#8217;t remember which. She was a philosophy major at UF 
        and would talk non-stop about de Beauvoir and Rousseau and Heidegger and 
        I pretended to listen. She had a birthmark below her left breast shaped 
        like Minnesota and I may have been in love with her.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> We parked near a dock labeled &#8220;Devil's Mouth&#8221; 
        and got our things together. I walked into a small shack with &#8220;Tubes/Rafts&#8221; 
        spray-painting on the door and rented two single inner tubes from a guy 
        in his late thirties with graying shoulder length blonde hair. Dinosaur 
        Jr. played from a run down CD player in the corner and weed was in the 
        air. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> I headed back to the dock and saw Cassy talking 
        to a group of shirtless guys in board shorts and trucker caps. I kept 
        an eye on them as I set up our rafts along the edge of the dock, wondering 
        what the hell she was doing talking to guys like that. She came back with 
        two lit cigarettes and handed me one. I didn't know she smoked.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Looks like it might rain,&#8221; I said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> She fanned herself with her free hand and looked 
        at the sky. &#8220;It's fixin' to.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Does that mean it'll cool off?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Nah, you'll just be hot and wet.&#8221; 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> She dropped the cigarette and put it out with 
        the tip of her flats. A confederate flag hung from a flagpole in the distance 
        but there wasn't much wind.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Cassy grabbed her tube and threw it into the water. 
        &#8220;Come on!&#8221; She yelled as she jumped in after it. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> I stuck a foot tenderly into the water and jumped 
        back. I thought I saw something in the distance. Small patches of weeds, 
        rotting driftwood, an old boot floating down stream...everything started 
        looking like an alligator. I never wanted to float down any rivers. I 
        don't even like water. I just wanted to take this girl back to her place 
        and fuck her for the rest of my life. I sure as hell didn't want to be 
        eaten by an alligator. Cassy&#8217;s wet skin shined in the August heat. 
        </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;You comin' in or what?&#8221; </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Give me a minute,&#8221; I flicked my limp 
        cigarette into the brush.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Well I ain't got awll day.&#8221; The long 
        drawl Cassy attached to her L's drove me crazy. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Her tight, exposed stomach and perky breasts urged 
        me in, and before I could think twice about alligators I leapt onto my 
        awaiting inner tube, almost overturning it in the process. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> I had to paddle rapidly in order to catch up to 
        Cassy, who had already drifted into the distance and was motioning for 
        me to hurry up. When I reached her she untied a piece of rope that she 
        had fastened to her arm and tied the plastic handles of our inner tubes 
        together so we wouldn&#8217;t drift apart, then took the plastic bag of 
        beer and wrapped it around the rope suspended between our bodies so the 
        beer could drift along with us submerged in the water. It didn&#8217;t 
        keep the beer cold so much as keep it from becoming hot. Either way after 
        a while it didn't taste any good.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> White clouds drifted across the sky and the heat 
        danced above the waterline; the only sounds were those of cranes darting 
        in and out of the water and the creaking of old wood. Through the trees 
        along the river there was nothing to see except the occasional hollowed 
        out house resting on planks or run-down Baptist church with white-washed 
        paint peeling from the heat. Spanish moss hung lazily from oak trees like 
        wet clothes drying on a line. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I feel like I'm trapped in a Faulkner novel,&#8221; 
        I said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Cassy laughed, &#8220;It's enough to make you 
        want to jump off a bridge.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;The moss on the trees is great, though. 
        We don't have stuff like that in California.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;It's infested with bugs. Stuff is disgusting.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> A small white house was barely visible through 
        the thick trees to our left.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I love all the houses along the water,&#8221; 
        I said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Cassy motioned toward the house with her free 
        hand. &#8220;Part of the South'n allure, I suppose.&#8221; Alllllure.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Looks like the slightest breeze would rip 
        them apart.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I reckon it would.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> The houses were exactly the way I had imagined 
        them: cracked paint, splintered frame, windows blown out and doors rusted 
        through, but still as natural to the landscape as the trees or the river. 
        The smell of magnolias and a hint of far off orange trees came to me with 
        a slight breeze blowing west. All of this was part of a fairy tale books 
        had implanted in my mind years ago&#8212;a fairytale based around well 
        mannered and well dressed men, mint juleps, long, slender cigarettes and 
        all that other shit. That's why I was here in the South&#8212;well, that 
        and to find a girl&#8212;this girl. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Loud music echoed across the water and I turned 
        to see the guys Cassy had been talking to on the dock come into sight 
        behind us floating along on a small continent of inflatable rafts. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I thought only people in San Diego still 
        listened to Sublime,&#8221; I said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Cassy laughed and we paddled as quickly as we 
        could to get out of earshot of the music and the drunken mob.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> I finished my first bottle of beer and reached 
        into the water for another. &#8220;Do we have somewhere to put these empties?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Just toss 'em in the river.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> I threw the empty beer bottle into the water and 
        it drifted along with us until it filled up and sank to the bottom and 
        joined the bottles from countless trips just like this one at the bottom 
        of the river. I put my head in Cassy's lap, and the lazy flow of the water 
        washed over me as I stared up at the clouds. The heat didn't seem as bad 
        on the water. As we drifted along, large patches of weeds and tall grass 
        grazed my legs and exposed lower back, sending chills down my spine. The 
        larger patches would have been the perfect hiding place for an alligator 
        but I wasn't worrying about that.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;This is nice,&#8221; I dragged my free 
        hand across the surface of the water, &#8220;I could do this forever. 
        Some decent music would be nice, though,&#8221; Cassy smiled as she stroked 
        my hair. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Lets veer off to the left over here, I 
        have to show you something,&#8221; she said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">We pushed against the current to get our rafts 
        over to the left bank of the river which forked off into a narrow inlet. 
        We left our rafts where the water settled and swam along the pathway towards 
        a large group of people wadding where the inlet opened up into a large 
        pool of water. The muddy riverbed became increasingly shallow until it 
        was knee deep, and we stood up and started walking. The mud gave way to 
        sparkling white rocks checked with moss. Everyone seemed fixated on something 
        at the far end of the pool. After slipping across the slick rocks the 
        shallow riverbed opened up to stunning blue waters forty feet deep. Groups 
        of children stood on the far edges of the rocks and took turns diving 
        into the water. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;What&#8217;s down there?&#8221; I asked.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Caves,&#8221; she said, pointing down into 
        the water, &#8220;'Technically they're 'Springs',&#8221; she brushed away 
        a stray leave than had stuck to her arm. &#8220;It's an aquifer...a water 
        system that flows up from the ground. It creates underwater caves and 
        tunnels.&#8221; Her drawl seemed to have vanished. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;And people go in them?</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;All the time. They're all over Florida. 
        They extend for miles under there. This sort of thing is much more dangerous 
        than a gator, though,&#8221; she looked sideways at me and smiled, &#8220;people 
        spend their entire lives diving in these caves and they never learn all 
        their secrets. They can still get lost just as quick as you or I down 
        there.&#8221; She took a deep breath and dove under the water. I watched 
        her float down towards the bottom and dart back up. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Go down with me,&#8221; she said.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I took a deep breath and plunged in, cutting through 
        the water. Cassy followed close behind. As we came in on the mouth of 
        the cave my head felt like it was stuck in a vice and I was nearly out 
        of breath. We reached the entrance and I stared into the mouth, imagining 
        miles of cavernous tunnels marked only by a ten foot long gash in the 
        rock as dark as oil. I turned to see Cassy propel herself back up to the 
        surface but I stayed down, almost mesmerized. I used my last ounce of 
        strength as my lungs were about to explode to propel myself back up through 
        the water and into the open.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;That was amazing,&#8221; I said, gasping 
        for air.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Cassy brushed the water out of her eyes. &#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Let's go back. I want to see how far in 
        we can get.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;No chance.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;We've already been to the entrance. What's 
        a little bit further?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">She shook her head.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Why the hell not?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;We don't have oxygen tanks. We'd only have 
        enough air to get to the point where we couldn't find our way back out.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I&#8220;We don't have to go far...just a little 
        bit past the mouth,&#8221; I said, playfully splashing water on her.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;It's not going to happen,&#8221; she said, 
        &#8220;Ya know, there's probably gators down there.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I looked back towards the water. &#8220;Seriously?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">She sighed. &#8220;No.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I took a small breath and went under to see how 
        far down the entrance was. It seemed further away this time. And I was 
        nearly out of breath by the time we got down there. Maybe the caves weren't 
        such a good idea. I came back up to the surface.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Whatever,&#8221; Cassy said, slicking back 
        her hair, &#8220;If you really want to go in we can. But we aren't going 
        far. I'm not dying down there.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I looked down into the water. &#8220;No...we don't 
        have to. I don't want you to get hurt.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Cassy swam away. &#8220;Chickenshit.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Back on the river, dark clouds bunched up as the 
        skyline took on a dark aluminum tint and I breathed heavy, wet air. The 
        cranes that had been hanging around the riverbed flew away in unison. 
        The sun was no longer visible but the heat was.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Another set of buildings appeared through the 
        trees to my right. The white paint peeled off of them like wax dripping 
        down a candle. These houses weren't charming. Weeds had grown up through 
        the floorboards of one house and extended back out through the doorway 
        and empty windowpanes. Most of the backside of a church had been torn 
        off&#8212;leaving only the rubble not worth stealing&#8212;and the vacant 
        windows sat like gaping mouths mourning the stained glass window that 
        used to fill the space. We continued on past house after house, windows 
        blown out by strong winds, doors boarded up. A small kid&#8212;six, maybe 
        seven&#8212;had wondered into one of them and was picking through the 
        rubble. The wind had stopped blowing and I couldn't smell the orange trees 
        anymore. Maybe this was the real South. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Racquetball sized drops of rain dropped from the 
        sky and hit with loud plunks on the river, and the surface of the water 
        as it was pelted.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;We gotta get off the river for a while...follow 
        me,&#8221; Cassy said, and we paddled over to a dock hidden along the 
        riverbank, climbed out of our rafts and tied them up. We sat on the edge 
        of the dock, with our feet resting in the shallow end of the water trying 
        to cool off. A light canopy of trees extended out over the water and stopped 
        most of the rain from hitting us. I reached into the water and took two 
        fresh beers and handed one to Cassy. I broke the silence:</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Do you come out here a lot?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Been a few times,&#8221; she said, taking 
        a long drink of her beer.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;How does this one rate? Compared to the 
        others.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Could be better, I s'pose.&#8221; Her accent 
        had lost some of it's charm. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;What's that supp&#8212;&#8220;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> She exhaled, &#8220;I smell weed,&#8221; she said, 
        &#8220;and alligator, I think.&#8221; She whipped her head back towards 
        the trees. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Alligator? They have a smell?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;When you cook &#8216;em they do.&#8221; 
        She got up from the dock and headed towards the trees. I scrambled up 
        and followed her along a faded trail overgrown with brush. The muffled 
        sound of music and the smell of burning flesh hit me. In a clearing sheltered 
        by thick trees, we came upon two men in their late twenties; one holding 
        a joint, the other a large can of beer. A Hibachi in between the two was 
        uncovered and some kind of meat could be seen roasting, and a small CD 
        player resting on an old tree stump was blasting rap. I tried to motion 
        for Cassy to turn around and head back, but before I could she had already 
        stepped towards them. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Mind if we sit in with you guys &#8216;til 
        the rain lets up?&#8221; Cassy asked.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> The two men sized us up. The taller of the two 
        exhaled a large puff of smoke and the shorter reached into a cooler and 
        handed Cassy and I a can of Steel Reserve. The tall one was named Everett 
        and the short one was Pete. Everett was wearing an Emmitt Smith jersey 
        that had to have been fifteen years old and Pete looked like Dustin Hoffman 
        in Midnight Cowboy. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Is that gator you&#8217;re cooking?&#8221; 
        I asked Everett.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Gator tail, yessir.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Is it good?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Bit salty.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Everett speared two small pieces of meat and handed 
        one to each of us. Alligator didn't taste anything like I imagined. It 
        was good. But the idea of eating it on a regular basis didn't seem appealing.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;What&#8217;re you guys doin&#8217; all the 
        way out here?&#8221; Cassy asked while chomping on a piece of gator.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Oh, you know&#8212;&#8220; Everett started, 
        &#8220;&#8212;just waitin&#8217; for the South to rise again.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Cassy laughed but I didn&#8217;t get the joke. 
        We could still hear soft trickles of water running through the maze of 
        branches above us. Everett and Pete had grown up in Gainesville&#8212;a 
        rarity in a college town. They talked with Cassy about Gator football, 
        the growth of the city and Gator basketball.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;You guys have anything besides this Steel 
        Reserve? The stuff always makes me puke.&#8221; Everett looked like he 
        was about to say something to me, but before he could Pete handed Cassy 
        and I joints.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;This shit's comin' in all the way from 
        India&#8212;or Thailand, I can't remember which. I know a guy,&#8221; 
        Pete said with a beaming smile. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Halfway through Cassy's second joint and my third, 
        I noticed Everett staring at Cassy, and by the way she played with her 
        hair nervously, she noticed too. I started to say something but couldn't 
        find the words. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Somethin' wrong?&#8221; She finally asked.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Everett looked up from the Hibachi. &#8220;Oh&#8230;no, 
        nothing Miss, I was just thinkin&#8217; &#8216;bout how familiar you look 
        is all. Like I seen you before.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I live in Gainesville, maybe you&#8217;ve 
        seen me around. I go to UF.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Everett squinted, &#8220;Nah that ain&#8217;t it. 
        I know I&#8217;ve seen you before though&#8230;&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Well I don&#8217;t know what to tell y&#8212;&#8220; 
        </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Porn! That&#8217;s it. You&#8217;re in 
        porno ain't you?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Cassy looked horrified. &#8220;Fuck off!&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Come on guys,&#8221; I said, puffing at 
        my point, &#8220;lay off her.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;No, seriously. That&#8217;s it. Pete, ain&#8217;t 
        you seen this chick in porno before?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Pete looked up from the Hibachi: &#8220;I don&#8217;t 
        know, man, I don&#8217;t watch no white porno.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Everett looked at his friend. &#8220;The fuck?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Pete shrugged. &#8220;I seen enough white pussy 
        to last me a lifetime, man. I only watch Puerto Rican and Indonesian porn.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Indonesian porn? What the fuck, man.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Hey man what I do at my computer&#8217;s 
        my own fuckin&#8217; business.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Whatever man, anyway--&#8221; Everett turned 
        back towards Cassy, &#8220;I'm sorry Miss, didn't mean nothin' by it. 
        Honest mistake.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> She shrugged it off and kept smoking. I was too 
        high to care about defending her. The beams of light that had been shooting 
        through the treetops dimmed as dusk came on. Everett lit a match and used 
        it to ignite a small hurricane lantern hung from a branch behind him. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Pete sighed. &#8220;It's still so damned hot.&#8221; 
        He looked at me, &#8220;You ain't from 'round here. ya?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;No, Southern California.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Bet you ain't used to this heat. Bet yall're 
        used to the heat packin' it in for the day 'long with the sun. Things're 
        different out here,&#8221; he brushed his can of Steel Reserve across 
        his forehead. &#8220;It's so damned hot.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Pete removed his shirt, exposing a thick patch 
        of chest hair that extended all the way to his waistline. Everett howled.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Honestly Pete, put your shirt back on! 
        They don't wanna see your goddamn Sasquatch chest,&#8221; he turned towards 
        us, &#8220;sorry y'all. Pete here's got no manners, or common sense for 
        that matter. &#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Like you're the King of fuckin' England 
        yourself there Everett.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Pete shut the fuck up,&#8221; Everett said, 
        looking at Cassy and me. &#8220;'Bout as useful as tits on a boarhog.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Cassy laughed but I had no idea what he meant. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> I tried to get Cassy's attention so we could leave. 
        I had soaked up about as much local color as I could stand. Everett broke 
        in before I could get her attention.</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;How're yall doin' on your joints?&#8221; 
        He turned to Cassy, &#8220;Need another one mi&#8212;&#8220; He cut himself 
        short. &#8220;I'm surely sorry miss but I just can't seem to shake this 
        notion that I seen you in a porno before!&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;You fuc&#8212;&#8220;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I'm sorry i'm sorry. But you sure you ain't 
        never been involved in any....uhhh, what's the word....adult entertainment?&#8221;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> Cassy had turned red. For one reason or another 
        I was enjoying this. I didn't want to protect her. I didn't want to be 
        the Southern gentleman anymore. I wanted to see her squirm. Hell these 
        two creeped me out too. But it turns out she didn't need my help. She 
        exploded:</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Listen you two inbred motherfuckers. Just 
        because you only have a quarter of a brain between you because your parents 
        were at least distantly related, and in this guys case--&#8221; She pointed 
        at Pete, &#8220;&#8212;at least one of them was a farm animal, doesn't 
        mean you can go around harassing women.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;Miss i&#8212;&#8220;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;No no, no talking. Maybe if you two didn't 
        spend most of your life in some moonshine, grit and gunpowder induced 
        haze, dreaming about fixing up your fucking Camero or whatever, you'd 
        recognize that I'm not like you. I'm not going to do porno to help support 
        the babies my brother impregnated me with or to pay off some debt my Daddy 
        chalked at the track or sit around at a Waffle House on a Friday night 
        betting my equally moronic friends just how many Belgian fucking waffles 
        I can scarf down before I puke. Ok? So FUCK OFF.&#8221; </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> She stormed off, and I followed. She didn't draw 
        out any of those L's. I apologized and left before either of them really 
        knew what had happened.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> We continued on down the river in silence. The 
        rope tying our tubes together unraveled from water damage but we didn't 
        bother to retie it. The humidity became thicker after the rain and all 
        I could think about was the heat. Signs started to appear that signaled 
        the end of the river as it reached its estuary and opened up for its big 
        finish into the Gulf of Mexico. Cassy paddled over to the left side of 
        the riverbank and the final dock. I followed her. She got out of her tube 
        and brushed the excess water off of her body with her hands. </font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> As we started walking back to Cassy's car, the 
        smell of the river coming off of our bodies hit me&#8212;and it wasn't 
        magnolias or orange trees&#8212;it was rotting wood and piss, and the 
        heat only made it worse. The sun had passed down through the trees in 
        the distance but the heat was still there, mixing the water from the river 
        in with our sweat. I thought about alligators for the first time in a 
        while. They didn't seem so bad anymore. I didn't matter to them. They 
        were around before me and they'll be around after me. There's other things 
        for a man to be afraid of. </font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;You know,&#8221; Cassy said as her car 
        came into sight, &#8220;I read somewhere that scientists are saying all 
        of Florida will be under water by like, the end of the twenty-first century. 
        I guess our kids or grandkids won't have any rivers to float down.&#8221;</font></p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">&#8220;I don't see what's so great about it anyway,&#8221; 
        I said as we got into her car.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF"> When we got back to her apartment, I went in to 
        use the bathroom and then left. I haven't spoken to Cassy since. She wasn't 
        what I was looking for. I guess I stopped caring so much about the South 
        in general. Whatever Faulkner saw in the place didn't mean much to me 
        and I'm not cut out for the heat or the rivers or the caves. We have caves 
        in California, and you don't have to drown to see them. That doesn't mean 
        I don't have a newfound fear of them, though. Plus, it'll all be underwater 
        someday. </font> </p>
