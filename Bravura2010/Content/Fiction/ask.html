<span id="title">Don’t Ever Ask Me Again</span><br />
Nate Halda<br /><br />

<span class="findent">Well</span>, when I was eight, I was left at a gas station in Beaver, Utah.  My mother didn’t realize I was missing.  The attendant called the police and they picked me up.  That was the first time I rode in a cop car.<br />
<span class="findent">And</span> when I was twelve, my dad took me out of school early to go to the art galleries at Balboa Park.  I had been begging to go there for weeks.<br />
<span class="findent">“No</span> phone calls, no sports radio,” he said. “Today’s all about you, bud.”<br />
<span class="findent">We</span> stood and stared at Rembrandt’s <span class="emph">St. Bartholomew</span> for a while.  I leaned in close to get a better look and my dad asked what a bearded man holding a knife had to do with God.<br />
<span class="findent">Before</span> I went to bed that night we made plans to get breakfast the next morning.  He told me he’d wake me up at seven.<br />
<span class="findent">“We’ll</span> go to that place with the omelets you like,” he said.<br />
<span class="findent">I</span> woke up the next morning at seven-forty five.  He had moved out in the middle of the night.<br />
<span class="findent">So</span> yeah, you can say I have abandonment issues.
