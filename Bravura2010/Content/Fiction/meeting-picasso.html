<span id="title">Meeting Picasso</span><br />
Lynn Heyman<br /><br />

<span class="findent">It</span> was late spring, mid-Tuesday in Antibes. The sky was clear and cloudless, the air warm. Narrow streets invited daring drivers in the smallest cars to find their way between old stonewalls and potted red geraniums.<br />
<span class="findent">The</span> Musée Picasso was the former home of the artist himself, The backdrop was the glittering Mediterranean. The salt air stung her nose as she pulled into a rare parking spot. She walked up the stone ramp to the massive wooden doorway. She entered. The museum was empty.<br />
<span class="findent">The</span> view from the lobby was of the azure blue waters of the French Riviera. A small area outside the French doors beckoned to her. She thought she was alone. She was mistaken. To her right was a bronze sculpture of a woman with her arms crossed. To her left was a short man in a well-fitted black t-shirt, elegant black pants and a gleaming black belt, his profile and bald head were outlined by the sea.<br />
<span class="findent">She</span> walked toward the low wall and leaned out, letting the breeze catch her blonde hair. She watched the profile of the man out of the corner of her eye and it appeared to be the artist himself. Perhaps because of the glint of the sun, he appeared to be smiling at her. She walked back into the lobby.<br /> 
<span class="findent">The</span> receptionist raised her head of stylishly coiffed burgundy hair and said in heavily accented English, “May I assist you, Mademoiselle?” She added in French “Est-ce que je peux vous aider?”<br />
<span class="findent">“I</span> wondered if that was Picasso out there on the terrasse?”<br />
<span class="findent">“Oui,</span> Mademoiselle, it is the artist. Go and speak to him. I can assure you he would enjoy that very much.”<br />
<span class="findent">“Oh,</span> I don’t want to disturb...” her voice trailed off.<br />
<span class="findent">“No,</span> you would not be disturbing him at all. He likes to speak to people. This used to be his home, as you may know. He will welcome you as a guest.”<br />
<span class="findent">She</span> was very skeptical as she walked out onto the stone terrace overlooking the sea. To her surprise, he moved toward her. “Bonjour, Mademoiselle,” he said with sparkling, penetrating eyes.<br />
<span class="findent">“Bonjour,</span> Monsieur Picasso,” she said.<br />
<span class="findent">“You</span> know who I am?” he said with surprise. He was seventy years her senior, but he spoke with a young confidence.<br />
<span class="findent">“May</span> I ask you a question about my favorite painting in the side gallery?” she ventured.<br />
<span class="findent">“With</span> pleasure.” He smiled broadly. “Let’s go and see.” He walked quickly and with great determination.<br />
<span class="findent">“It’s</span> called <span class="emph">Joie de Vivre</span>,” she offered.<br />
<span class="findent">“Look</span> at this one,” he said. “I don’t like it. I never liked it.” He took the painting of the sad woman off the wall. She stood there, stunned. She waited for an alarm to go off. Silence.<br />
<span class="findent">He</span> opened a hidden closet, which appeared to be part of the white wall. Canvases were stacked inside. He pulled out another painting and placed it on the wall. It resembled a study of Manet’s <span class="emph">Luncheon on the Grass</span>, in the style of Picasso, with nude bathers. The breasts of the women were enormous.<br />
<span class="findent">He</span> went back into the closet and stepped out carrying a wet paintbrush. He began to repaint a part of the canvas with a bright blue paint. <span class="emph">He could do that</span>, she thought. He was Picasso. <span class="emph">He could do anything he wanted to do in his museum</span>.<br />
<span class="findent">“There.</span> Much better.” He said.<br />
<span class="findent">“Let</span> me show you my ceramics. They are upstairs. Follow me,” he commanded.<br />
<span class="findent">She</span> could not speak. She followed him as he had asked.<br />
<span class="findent">They</span> arrived at the top floor, light flooding in through the many windows.<br />
<span class="findent">“I</span> have a whole collection of these plates and cups at my house. I dine off my plates all the time. I don’t like the other dinner plates, so I created my own. They are all over my kitchen.”<br />
<span class="findent">“Oh,”</span> she managed. Picasso made his own dinnerware. He held out a square plate with a blue fish on it.<br /> 
<span class="findent">“Would</span> you like to join me for dinner tonight?”<br />
<span class="findent">She</span> smiled at him in disbelief.<br />
<span class="findent">“If</span> you do,” he continued, “you can keep this plate, or would you prefer a cup or a bowl?”<br />
<span class="findent">She</span> felt her face flush in the humidity and the heat of the sun that was now pouring into the gallery.<br />
<span class="findent">“Do</span> you know <span class="emph">La Californie</span>? My villa is there up on the hill not far from here.”<br />
<span class="findent">“I</span> … I don’t know,” she stuttered.<br />
<span class="emph"><span class="findent">Is</span> Picasso asking me out on a date</span>? He looked like her grandfather somewhat. She remembered reading about his reputation for womanizing and physical violence towards women. His libido was renowned.<br />
<span class="findent">She</span> viewed the ceramic owl with the head of a woman next to an animal jug on four feet.<br />
<span class="findent">“I</span> don’t think that would be a very good idea,” she said, blinking and clearing her throat.<br />
<span class="findent">“No.</span> You are right,” he said. “Not a good idea at all.”<br />
<span class="findent">He</span> disappeared between the white walls in his black pants and black shirt. She never had an answer to her question, which now seemed superfluous.
