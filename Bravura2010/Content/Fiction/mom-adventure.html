<span id="title">A Mom’s Computer Adventure</span><br />
Donna Dellinger<br /><br />

<span class="findent">Its</span> one big glassy eye stared at me. Who would win this contest? Suddenly, it blinked off. Victory. But when I bumped the keyboard, its deceptive face reappeared. I would not be fooled by its cloud-dotted blue sky and rolling hill of green grass.<br />

<span class="findent">I</span> knew otherwise. It was just a false front of pastoral peace. Earlier it had spitefully stolen all my morning’s work – a week of menus complete with recipes and a shopping list. And I had just spent the last two hours retyping it, begrudgingly. Knowing its past treacheries, I should have backed up my file. That is what I attempted to do next. From around my neck, I removed the little drive my son had lovingly draped over my head before he disappeared into his room to his own time-consuming beast. Although, he had tamed his.<br />

<span class="findent">My</span> son was whom I hailed. “Ryan, can you help me with the computer?”<br />

<span class="findent">“Can’t</span>, Mom. I’m in a dungeon.”<br />

<span class="findent">Yes,</span> I knew the feeling. I was trapped by my own illiteracy of the tech age. <span class="emph">Where do I even plug this in? Which side is up? No, I can do this</span>, I thought. It wasn’t as if I was trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. Simple eye hand coordination was the only requirement for step one.<br />

<span class="findent">It</span> slid into the last place I tried. I smiled. But my delight immediately disappeared when nothing happened. “Now what?” I yelled to my knight-in-shining-armor down the hall.<br />

<span class="findent">“I’m</span> almost done,” Ryan replied. That meant another hour.<br />

<span class="findent">I</span> could pull the mom rank and demand instant obedience, but I decided not to. “Can you just tell me what to do next? I stuck it in already.”<br />

<span class="findent">“Go</span> to ‘My Computer’”<br />

<span class="findent">I</span> swept the mouse over to the icon and double left clicked. The window popped up, but then I froze in panic. A wave of nausea passed through me. There before me on the screen was a list of… I didn’t know what. The little pictures under the labels were no help either.<br />

<span class="findent">“Which</span> one is it?” I hollered again.<br />

<span class="findent">“What</span> did you name it?”<br />

<span class="findent">Silently</span>, I was reciting several names I would have liked to call it, but then I recognized my own name. Anne. How sweet – it was trying to reach out to me. But should I trust it? I double clicked on that one. It magically opened into another window with more meaningless options.<br />

<span class="findent">Before</span> I could get flustered again, Ryan came up behind me. “Okay Mom. What are you trying to do?” Only a hint of condescension edged his tone. Without waiting for my answer, he leaned over my shoulder and took the mouse from me. “First do this.” He clicked something.<br />

<span class="findent">I</span> moved over to give him more room.<br />

<span class="findent">“Then</span> you do this,” he continued. He dragged something. “Then this.” He clicked something else. “Go down here.”<br />
 
<span class="findent">He</span> was now sitting in my seat.<br />
 
<span class="findent">“Click</span> this. Click this. Then here.”<br />
 
<span class="findent">He</span> had lost me at the first click. I guessed I would forever be dependent on my personal computer nerd.<br />

<span class="findent">“Done</span>,” he announced as he handed back my drive.<br />

<span class="findent">“Thanks</span>,” I said, still in a daze. But he had already vanished like a vision. A surge of accomplishment rushed through me, and I could feel myself beaming. I wanted to admire my handiwork one more time. With practiced nonchalance, I opened my prized file. I waited and waited, the little hourglass turning, microscopic sands shifting.<br />
 
<span class="findent">The</span> page sprung open…blank.
