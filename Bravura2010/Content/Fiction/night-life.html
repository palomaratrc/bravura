<p class=BodyFont>Sleep never came easy. Comfort and darkness were
arch-enemies, and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
lay in the middle as the two converged, turning her bedroom into a battlefield.
That was the way every night went.</p>

<p class=BodyFont>“Bedtime,” Janine yelled from her spot on the sofa where she
spent the last hours of the day watching re-runs of<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><i>Golden Girls<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></i>or<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><i>Mama’s Family.<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></i>It didn’t matter which; <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> thought all of
Janine’s entertainment choices were boring. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> turned the volume up on the stereo and
returned her attention to the pages of<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><i>Mary
<span class=SpellE>Poppins</span>.</i></p>

<p class=BodyFont>In the bathroom Dad went through his nightly routine. <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> heard the hinges on
the medicine cabinet cry and the mirror rattle as her father readied his
shaving supplies. He used a tarnished Gillette safety razor. Its design and
engineering was a thing of the past, with its twist-open-butterfly insert
mechanism that held a thin double-edged blade.</p>

<p class=BodyFont>“Ready for bed yet?” Dad’s voice came through the door
accompanied by the smell of old leather. When he <span class=GramE>peeked</span>
his head into the room, his cheeks were pink and fresh, but a speck of red
dotted his chin. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
thought it looked like a bull’s eye. She was still wearing her play clothes.
“All right, well don’t make Janine come back here. You know she’s trying, and
you don’t need to be giving her a hard time.”</p>

<p class=BodyFont><span class=GramE>“Dad?”</span></p>

<p class=BodyFont>“What is it?”</p>

<p class=BodyFont>“I don’t get why she has to stay here.”</p>

<p class=BodyFont>“<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>,
we’ve gone over this. Janine and I are married. We’re a family now.”</p>

<p class=BodyFont>“But-”</p>

<p class=BodyFont>“You know she loves you right?” Dad’s head tilted to the side
and dipped towards his shoulder. <span class=GramE>“Right?</span> Well she
does, just give her a chance. Treat her like you would your mother.”</p>

<p class=BodyFont>“But I don’t love her,” <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
blurted out before she could be cut off.</p>

<p class=BodyFont>“That’s enough,” Dad ordered with a deep voice. “She cares
about you and she’s trying. You can do the same. Now get ready for bed and I’ll
see you in the morning.” This was the routine farewell. With the moon glowing
from above, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
hugged her father before he left for work.</p>

<p class=BodyFont><span class=GramE>“Dad?”</span> She called, as her father
edged out of the room. “I love you.”</p>

<p class=BodyFont>“Love you too.”</p>

<p class=BodyFont>That was their goodbye. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
would wait until breakfast to see her father again. It felt like waiting for
Christmas. She picked up where she left off, halfway through her
library-borrowed-responsibility. But her attention drifted into the living room
as she listened to the conversation between her father and Janine. He said <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> was ready for bed,
but it wouldn’t hurt to check up on her. Then <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> heard Dad say the same words he had
just spoken to her. Was it the same love? <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
wondered. The rattle of the screen door and jingle of keys sounded through the
house. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>’s
bedroom turned into a vacuum. Her chest and lungs wrung her free of breath. In
grand finale fashion, the dead bolt slammed into the door frame and her father
was gone. The dead bolt was supposed to provide a measure of security, yet <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> was undecided. How
would that little piece of metal stop anyone from breaking down the door? If
they wanted in, they would find a way. She knew this. She also knew that being
on the inside, where it was supposed to be safe, gave her no relief.</p>

<p class=BodyFont><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
put her book aside and crept down the hallway. She needed to get out of her
room, and thought that, just maybe, Janine’s company would calm her nerves.
Light from the television splashed down the corridor spotlighting <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>’s figure. Keeping
tight to the wall, she could see Janine’s feet parked on top of the ottoman,
but her face was hidden by the corner of the hall entry. Janine adjusted her
legs and found new comfort on the couch. </p>

<p class=BodyFont>“You better be in bed when I get back there,” she commanded.
Channels flipped by and settled on<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><i>Three’s
Company,<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></i>a show with a theme
song <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> had
grown to hate. “Radio off, books <span class=GramE>away,</span> and pajamas on”
were the last demands <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Alice</st1:City></st1:place>
heard as she strolled back to her bedroom staring at the carpet with sorrow
painted in her eyes. She followed the instructions. Her jeans were loose in the
legs from the day’s activities and no longer comfortable anyway.</p>

<p class=BodyFont>“I see the light still on,” Janine barged through the door,
her cheeks pushed high and the pupils of her eyes concentrated. Her nose
performed this little circular <span class=GramE>bob, that</span> <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Alice</st1:City></st1:place> always assumed was
just her way of clearing any mucous from her nose. As often as she did it, she
must have a lot of junk up there <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
thought. “Just wanted to say goodnight and make sure you were tucked in. <span
class=GramE>Supposed to get chilly tonight.”</span> Janine said.</p>

<p class=BodyFont>“Thanks.”</p>

<p class=BodyFont>“<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>?”
She <span class=GramE>asked,</span> undecided whether or not she had a
question. “I know your mother...well, what I mean is, I know how close you to <span
class=GramE>were</span> at the end and how special she was.”</p>

<p class=BodyFont><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
knew that Janine didn’t have any children of her own. It seemed odd, and <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> didn’t know if
Janine was afraid of motherhood or if she just didn’t like kids. Maybe she
couldn’t have them <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
wondered.</p>

<p class=BodyFont>“If you ever need anything,” Janine continued. “Anything at
all, you let me know.”</p>

<p class=BodyFont>“Ok.” <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
thought about Janine’s offer and figured it was worth something. “Janine?”</p>

<p class=BodyFont><span class=GramE>“Yeah?”</span></p>

<p class=BodyFont>“Do you like Glen Miller?”</p>

<p class=BodyFont><span class=GramE>“Who?”</span></p>

<p class=BodyFont><span class=GramE>“Just some musician.</span> <span
class=GramE>Never mind.”</span></p>

<p class=BodyFont>Janine pulled the blankets up high and tucked them under <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>’s torso, bent over,
and kissed her on the forehead. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
wasn’t used to this late night ritual. Mom was the one she saw last before
falling asleep. It was Mom who tucked her in, and it was Mom who kissed her goodnight.
Now, the routine was weird to her. But there was something familiar between the
two women that saw <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
to sleep. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
could smell Jasmine and Lily of the Valley. It was Janine’s perfume.<span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><span class=SpellE><span class=GramE><i>Diorissimo</i></span></span><span
class=GramE><i>.</i></span><span class=apple-converted-space><i>&nbsp;</i></span>Mom
wore the same scent. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
smiled trying to hide the desire for her mother.</p>

<p class=BodyFont>“Goodnight <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>.
I love you...” The lady, that had only been part of the family for three
months, pushed in the fob on the bedside lamp and made her way out of the room.</p>

<p class=BodyFont>“Goodnight.”</p>

<p class=BodyFont>Darkness swallowed the room painting the walls black and
leaving <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
to drown in nothing but shadow. She couldn’t see her hand if shoved right in
front of her face. This was the point of no return. Mom had been here. Except
her lights turned off for good, and she was forced to live without help from
her eyes.</p>

<p class=BodyFont><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
couldn’t understand the dark. Life disappeared when the lights turned off and
your vision was stolen from you. Sure, she could feel the air in her nose, as
she breathed, along with the rise and fall of her chest. But she couldn’t see
any of that. And just like Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy, which she had never
seen and thus never believed<span class=GramE>,</span> <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Alice</st1:City></st1:place> knew the dark had a tricky way of
controlling the world. Nothing lived in the dark. Why couldn’t life stop when
the light switch fell?</p>

<p class=BodyFont>It was a question she asked herself every night. She tried
counting sheep, warm milk, and every other trick. There was only one answer. <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> shuffled from the
warm indention of her body in the mattress, rose up, reached out blindly, and
turned the light on. She was alive again.</p>

<p class=BodyFont><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
wondered how her father worked the night shift. Not just the weird schedule
that had him lying down for bed at lunch time, but how he managed in the dark
puzzled her. She couldn’t hold herself together within the borders of her own
room. How was it that Dad could operate in such a large space as the open night
sky? She was almost convinced that her father was a hero. He worked in
security. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
didn’t know what he protected, but she knew it wasn’t her. He left every night
to stand watch over someone, or something, more important than his own
daughter.</p>

<p class=BodyFont>With the light on, night time took on a new shade and <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> could see the
comforts of her bedroom. Among the many things that provided her with security,
the most dominant item, physically, was her bookshelf. Tall and wide, it
reminded <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
of a solider at attention, her own personal guard standing watch. Where the
bookshelf provided the muscle, her turntable and stash of jazz records supplied
<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> with a
mental spa retreat. Mom and Dad once danced the “Lindy Hop” in the living room
with the same sound system pumping out healthy rhythms. Mom wore the “flapper”
dress she bought from the Goodwill for a dollar-fifty. When Dad spun Mom into a
torrent, the silk fringe on her royal blue dress swayed in chaos and glittered
in the sun’s rays. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
watched and waited her turn to be twisted dizzy and reeled back into her
father’s barrel chest. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
saved the record player, and the sounds of long ago, from a dust soaked
cardboard box in the garage. Her father said nothing when he saw and heard the
records playing in her room.</p>

<p class=BodyFont><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
kept what everyone knew as “The Disneyland Picture” on her nightstand. It was
the only remains of the first and last family vacation. A stranger had taken
the photo. Mom was seated in her motorized scooter. She stared to the left of
the camera lens, all smiles, as if she was interested in a far off attraction.
Repeated directions from the stranger failed to capture her focus. The stranger
didn’t know any better. Besides, the sunglasses Mom wore hid her well. Dad only
wanted his daughter to have one last memory, a good one, so he posed for the
camera. </p>

<p class=BodyFont><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
held the photograph, comparing the effects of time. She had grown a couple
inches, she thought, and the style of her hair was more in tune with that of
the boys from school. Often, in the summertime, Mom and daughter sat on the
weathered concrete steps of the three-bedroom bungalow’s front porch. <st1:City
w:st="on">Alice</st1:City> squeezed between Mom’s legs, and with the sun
showering the two of them Mom braided <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>’s
hair into pigtails. At the ends Mom tied pink silk bows to hold the interlaced
weave of honey brown hair in place. The bows disappeared after the picture was
taken. Dad’s hair made some transformations of its own, failing the test of <span
class=GramE>time,</span> it was now peppered with gray. Mom was no longer in
the picture. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
wished she could feel the wind blow through her hair again.</p>

<p class=BodyFont><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>’s
eyelids were failing her. It felt like fifty-pound weights were attached to
them. Each time they closed <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>’s
head toppled forward and seconds went by before she responded. With a futile
jolt she snapped her body into an upright position bringing her back to
attention. It was a continuous game that <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
wanted no part of. Where the heck is the sun? <span class=GramE>she</span> thought.
<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> wanted to
see that big ball of glowing heat more than anything right now. If she could
make it to 3:30am, starving her body of sleep, she knew she’d see sunrise. Her
second wind was waiting. If <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
could strain forward, and stretch out her arms they would be within fingertips
reach. It was rare they ever made contact. It only happened when <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> was allowed a
friend to sleep over; she needed a conversation partner to share in the lunacy
that late hours brought on kids. But now, alone, it was about having a goal and
that measuring device of time was all she had to help her defense against
sleep.</p>

<p class=BodyFont><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
climbed out of bed. She needed to move around, <span class=GramE>get her blood</span>
flowing, and some fresh air might help. She moved to the window, and opened it
to see the empty, silent streets. <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Orange
  street</st1:address></st1:Street> lamps poured onto the asphalt, their light
swallowed by the black road. Across the street, the <span class=SpellE>Judsons</span>’
garage was left open. The chrome bumper of Mr. Judson’s Cadillac refused to let
its shine die even after the sun had gone down. In the sky <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> could see the stars blink back in
forth, to one another, the way her father winked his eye when they had a secret
between the two of them. </p>

<p class=BodyFont>A dog barked in the distance, and another responded with an
even louder call. The night seemed to have its own strange language that <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> couldn’t
understand. She listened, but couldn’t make sense of the elm tree’s leaves
crackling and its branches shaking in the cold night breeze. It was a
conversation she wasn’t meant to be part of. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> closed the window and fell back in bed.
Tears escaped from closed eyes as <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
danced with sleep.</p>

<p class=BodyFont>An hour before reaching her goal, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> gave into the night. She slept while
her bookcase kept lookout, record player sat ready to sing, and “The Disneyland
Picture” waited to see her smile in the morning. All her fears came to a boil
in those moments of sleep. It was her usual nightmare.</p>

<p class=BodyFont><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=BodyFont><span class=GramE>It always <span class=SpellE>begain</span>
with her mother’s feverish scream echoing through the house.</span> A scream
that came from deep in the gut and made <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
think of murder. She sprinted to the kitchen where she found her mother
crumpled on the floor, her knees grating against the linoleum, and the blades
of her back staring at the ceiling. Mom’s dirty blonde hair, still frizzy in
the early morning, curtained her face. She was muttering with all the sense of
a frightened child. Scrambled eggs continued to cook on the stove top. <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> screamed for help,
but her father had not yet returned from work. </p>

<p class=BodyFont>All <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
thought to do was grab hold of her mother and squeeze. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> held tight feeling the cries ripple
through her skin. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
didn’t know anything about death, but that’s all she saw in her mind. Her
mother was dying and she was going to hold on until the end. </p>

<p class=BodyFont>Then Mom climbed to her feet and wiped the drool off her
chin. She asked why <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
was on the floor and asked if she wanted pancakes or waffles for breakfast. <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> whispered “waffles”
and wondered what kind of game Mom was playing with her. It wasn’t a game, and
when <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> told
her father what happened, he didn’t believe a word she said. When he asked Mom
about the incident, she hadn’t a clue what <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> was talking about. </p>

<p class=BodyFont>It wasn’t until the outbursts and behavior changes became
more frequent that Dad believed her. He was forced to believe, and he took it
upon himself to take Mom to the hospital. It was a decision, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> thought, he regretted. The doctor
ordered a series of tests to diagnose the problem. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> could see her mother with a funny nylon
cap stretched over her head with a bunch of wires connected to it. She looked
like Medusa. The test, the doctor explained, would allow them to monitor Mom’s
brain activity and look for any dysfunction. Next was an MRI. Mom <span
class=GramE>laid</span> inside a tube that took three-dimensional pictures of
her brain. Last, a sample of Mom’s cerebral spinal fluid was taken using a
ruler sized needle. </p>

<p class=BodyFont>Three weeks passed before the results returned. It was a
costly three weeks. In such a short time Mom lost all memory of her daughter
and started calling her<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><i>Sheryl</i>.
“Where’s Sheryl?” she’d ask her husband, now just another face she didn’t
recognize. “We’re supposed to play dress up today and dance in the parlor.”</p>

<p class=BodyFont>They were in a doctor’s office now. Dad bear hugged Mom with
both arms, wrapping her like a flannel blanket. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> gripped her mother’s hand making the
veins bulge through pale skin. A slender framed man stood opposite them wearing
a white knee length coat, and holding a clipboard on the inside of his crossed
arms. The doctor looked like he was holding top secret information. <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> watched the man’s
silent mouth move. She couldn’t understand a word he said. Only two words ever
became audible:<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><i>fatal</i><span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>and<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><i>incurable</i>;
they rolled off the man’s tongue in a static and heartless rhythm. It was a
voice comfortable dealing a bad hand to those that didn’t deserve one.</p>

<p class=BodyFont>Mom moved into the spare bedroom. The hallucinations became
too much for Dad to handle. Mom swore someone was trying to kill her; they
dangled meat hooks from the ceiling trying to catch her like a fish. She ordered
Dad up into the attic to flush them out. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
noticed a change in Dad’s behavior. She could see it in the way his eyes
responded to Mom’s constant needs with hesitation. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> didn’t think her father had given up,
instead, he gave<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span><i>in</i>. He
still loved his wife, but he helped her brush her teeth in the morning, get
dressed, and bathe before bed with all the sentiment of a to-do list.</p>

<p class=BodyFont>Mom’s disease stripped away the strength and balance that it
took to walk. She spent most of her time in bed. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> could see her there now: a stainless
steel walker with two fuzzy green tennis balls attached at the bottom stood
close by. Several times <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
found Mom on the floor like a spilled bag of groceries. </p>

<p class=BodyFont><st1:City w:st="on">Alice</st1:City> tried talking to her
mother about <st1:place w:st="on">Disneyland</st1:place>. She showed her the
map and pointed out all the rides and attractions. In mid sentence, <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> felt Mom’s hand
clench on her wrist knocking the map to the floor. “Turn the lights back on,”
Mom yelled. “Don’t you fool around with me, <span class=GramE>Sheryl.</span> I
hate the dark, you know that. Now <span class=SpellE>turn’em</span> back on.” <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> looked around the
room. The curtains were wide open and the sun blazed through the windows. She
turned to Mom’s face, looking into her eyes. They were dark, empty, and the
smiling reflection <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
once saw was no longer there. Mom’s face darted around the room as she demanded
for the lights with an anger that bordered on hate. It was the tears that
forced <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> to
leave the room. The tears that dripped over her chin and <span class=SpellE>puddled</span>
on the bed’s linen, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
knew, went unnoticed by her mother. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
consoled herself in the bathroom.</p>

<p class=BodyFont><st1:place w:st="on">Disneyland</st1:place> lived up to its
calling as the “happiest place on earth.” But happiness didn’t go beyond the
exit gates. Days after their vacation, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
found Mom dead in the spare bedroom.</p>

<p class=BodyFont><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=BodyFont><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>’s
nightmare paused on this moment.</p>

<p class=BodyFont>Her body wailed and kicked at the mattress. The headboard
slammed against the wall sending a parade of racket down the hall to wake
Janine. Without thinking, Janine leapt from bed and ran towards <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>’s room. <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> would never know of
Janine’s reaction, but when her eyes flashed open she could hear Janine’s
calming whisper. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
was wrapped in this woman’s arms she barely knew, rocking back and forth, with
her head pressed tight against Janine’s chest. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> heard a steady thumping noise overcome
her cries. She could feel the pulse of Janine’s heart wipe the tears from her
face. This is what <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
wanted. It’s what she needed. It wasn’t the same mother, but <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City> knew she was in the right hands.</p>

<p class=BodyFont><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place></st1:City>
woke up the next morning, in the same position, to see Janine staring back at
her with tired, heavy eyes, and a smile.</p>
