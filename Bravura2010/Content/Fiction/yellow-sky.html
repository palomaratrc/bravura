<p class=BodyFont style='text-indent:0in'><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class=BodyFont><i><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></i></p>

<p class=BodyFont><i>Just another fool parading in a false triumphant
masquerade, dancing where there’s no music. I hope to see </i>You<i> become the
better. I hope to see all </i>your<i> dreams become as concrete as these
bathroom confining walls. <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=BodyFont>The fading mustard-yellow walls seemed to be more enclosed
than ever. It didn’t help that the three-piece mirror he stood before took most
of the space in his shanty half bath. He felt the world changing as he stared
into his reflection. The ribs in him stuck out and made a bumpy texture as he
ran his weak hands from his chest to his thighs. There were no windows and only
a brief crease between the door, and the floor let in a slight, cold draft that
made its way to his cold toes. </p>

<p class=BodyFont><i>If ever this <span class=GramE>body,</span> where my true
entity resides...and this pale-face reflection of mine...would just speak and
smile on its own...or even talk...what would </i>You<i> say? I know </i>You<i>
would say, “Are </i><span class=GramE>You</span><i> happy?” Just another
fucking question to add upon the millions of questions I have that are long due
to be answered by any person other than myself. <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=BodyFont>He stood before the mirror long enough for the humidity of
his present shower to completely fog his reflection. He couldn’t see himself
anymore—this he liked. His hands began to shake. It was time. He took a deep
breath—then, he completely stopped. He heard the main door in his apartment
open and then slam shut. His heart became beat-less and his ears perked in
attentiveness. Small footsteps began to approach—<i>Is it them? </i><span
class=GramE>he</span> thought.</p>

<p class=BodyFont>“John?” a little voice cried. The little girl, his daughter,
knocked on the bathroom door. </p>

<p class=BodyFont>His heart pulsed again and his nightmare became bliss. “<st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Regina</st1:place></st1:City>? Is that you?” He
unlocked the door enough to peek his right eye out, and he saw her standing
with her blue backpack that had dangling key-chains tossing around. She was
rummaging through his dusted paintings. They were the last that remained. </p>

<p class=BodyFont>“Can you walk me to school please? Mom wouldn’t wake up! I’m
already late and Mom said I shouldn’t be walking alone to school.” </p>

<p class=BodyFont>“Your mom’s right, you know? How did you get in?” He shrugged
that question off. “That’s beside the point. <span class=SpellE>Ima</span> have
a talk with your mom today. I’ll walk you to school. Wait a second, okay?” He
rapidly put his clothes on and turned off the shower and the lights and took a
last glance at the bathroom set-up before leaving. </p>

<p class=BodyFont>Halfway to school, as John and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Regina</st1:place></st1:City> walked along the broken concrete
sidewalk, he had to stop for breath and a five minute break that allowed him to
regain his equilibrium. This was a malfunction that he had recently discovered.
</p>

<p class=BodyFont>“I’m eight now. I can walk to school alone, you know.” </p>

<p class=BodyFont>“So you’re all grown up now, huh? But no, no you can’t. You
should always be with someone you know. I’ll always be there if...” He stopped
himself. What stopped him was not the crosswalk lady that seemed to be shaking
her head at the sight of him walking his daughter who was late to school for
God only knows what reason this time, but he himself had stopped his statement
to look at his daughter, to look at a part of him that was now part of this
life. She had his smile, his curly brown hair, and the green eyes of her
mother. Her mother, with the pharmaceutically nurtured back, was what he was
ashamed of, not what the crosswalk lady with the pruning face who was tightening
her lips in disgust thought about him in his blue jeans and plaid jacket. </p>

<p class=BodyFont>“Look, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Regina</st1:place></st1:City>...”
</p>

<p class=BodyFont>“John,” <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Regina</st1:place></st1:City>
interrupted. “What’s shame?” </p>

<p class=BodyFont><span class=GramE>“Shame?</span> What? Why?” His cell phone
began ringing. His fingers began twitching uncontrollably and he felt anxiety
rush through his body like a child or <st1:City w:st="on">Regina</st1:City> on
her first and only trip to <st1:place w:st="on">Disneyland</st1:place>. <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Regina</st1:place></st1:City> noticed his
trembling as well. “What have I said about calling me ‘John,’ huh? Try calling
me ‘Dad.’ Please?” </p>

<p class=BodyFont>Her eyes begged an answer like the judges in court. Yet hers
were in the shape of her mother’s. But hers were sweet and innocent and they
weren’t bleeding with manipulation. </p>

<p class=BodyFont>“Shame is a burden.” He knew she wouldn’t understand that
word so he said it. </p>

<p class=BodyFont>“So I’m a burden.” </p>

<p class=BodyFont>His plan backfired; it always did. “I’ll explain it to you
when the time comes, okay honey? Please go to school. Your crosswalk lady is
looking at me like your mom when I don’t give her <span class=SpellE>her</span>
money.” </p>

<p class=BodyFont><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Regina</st1:place></st1:City>
laughed. It surprised him that she even laughed. “Daddy...” His heart stopped
when that word entered his ear. It was a beautiful yet rare sound. “That’s not
funny.” She gave him a hug and crossed the street and he watched her go until
she vanished from where he stood. It scared him knowing that he couldn’t see
her; on the other hand, he could see all of life’s damnations being prone to
her vulnerability in her youth. </p>

<p class=BodyFont><i>The Phone,</i> he thought immediately. <i>No missed calls?</i>
He was more use to this malfunction than the loss of breath. <i>The phone rings
when it shouldn’t and doesn’t when it should</i>. </p>

<p class=BodyFont>He looked around and began walking west to his habitual
rendezvous. He was desperate this time since his plan had backfired. Within
minutes he was at the street intersection and after hours of waiting, his nails
were narrowed to the rim of his flesh. <i>Where is he? Why isn’t he here?</i>
He ignored his untied shoes; they were of no importance right now. Instead, he
walked in circles as his dependence sunk past his normal cravings. His palms
began sweating. His newly smoothed, cracked fingernail tips began pulling away
at his frail hair. He looked across at every corner. <span class=GramE>Nothing.</span>
His connection wasn’t there. His body <span class=GramE>hungered</span> the fix
of the day. Again he checked his phone as it shook within his crippling hands. <i>Isn’t
thirteen voicemails enough?</i> His heart kept beating fast. <i>It’s an
addiction,</i> he thought. And it took until now to know he was sick. But that
didn’t matter right now. The only thing that mattered was his remedy. He wanted
the pain gone before he would fall. Fall into a web of hopelessness and into deeper
debt with the dealer he feared would soon break his door, break his stuff, <span
class=GramE>break</span> him. He saw himself clinging to the spoon at home like
a weak fool, and he predicted right. He would be home in thirty minutes. He
would be fixed. But his last breath would not be regained in a five minute
break.</p>

<p class=BodyFont><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=BodyFont>He found himself coming back to a familiar world where pain
was the element of life and staying alive caused it. <i>He that dies pays all
debts.</i> That quote had come up with the first thoughts of realizing he was
alive. He’d been here before. It wouldn’t be long until the doctors would say
he had just had an overdose. He closed his eyes when a sudden sound made them
open:</p>

<p class=BodyFont>“So...I’m your burden, huh?”</p>

<p class=BodyFont>He was in no state to answer, but in the perfect state to
know that his daughter was the one holding his hand. He also knew that there
weren’t two pairs of green eyes in the room, so he looked straight through the
window unable to really put an effort to move.</p>

<p class=BodyFont>“Mom calls it shame.”</p>

<p class=BodyFont>He raised himself to sit straight and speak to the window and
out to the dying day outside. And with the little strength he had in him he
spoke.</p>

<p class=BodyFont>“Shame is in the world, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Regina</st1:place></st1:City>.
It’s the pain triggered in your back or a pill you swallow that leaves that
bitter taste in the throat of your mouth. Look,” he said, pointing at his
stomach. “Shame is my own stomach. <span class=GramE>Under-nourished.</span> <span
class=GramE>A lack of self love.”</span></p>

<p class=BodyFont>Across the room and through the window, the fatiguing
brightness in the yellow sky simmered ever slightly to nightfall. He was unable
to move as the earth was endlessly spinning. He could see the last remaining
brushes of pink streaks glossing the sky as the falling sun was sinking and
robbing the day of its beauty. Meanwhile, he was here. </p>

<p class=BodyFont>“I’m stuck with you, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Regina</st1:place></st1:City>,
and that’s fine with me. I can’t say you’re a burden because I’m the one lying
here unable to hold your hand. I’m the burden. When you reached for my hand, I
understood...”</p>

<p class=BodyFont>He thought about the questions the doctors would ask. <span
class=GramE>The explanations for the set-up in the bathroom where he last remembered
falling.</span> <span class=GramE>The pills.</span> <span class=GramE>The fix.</span>
<span class=GramE>The suicide.</span> He suddenly remembered—before he
attempted to fill his mouth with death—waiting for those little footsteps to
come in and rescue him once again. This time, they never came. And death was
never washed down with a glass of water gripped firm in his hands. His eager
and stupid fix had stopped his heart. It had stopped him from his art. Nothing,
however, had stopped a frantic mom in search of her daughter to stroll into his
once blooming artistic apartment and finding him unconscious. That didn’t
matter now. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-family:"Adobe Garamond Pro"'>“...I
understand,” he continued, “...that acceptance is in the world.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
