Jamie Dykstra<br /><br /><br />


It’s not all about time,<br />
Some things are timeless.<br />
It’s not all about money,<br />
Some things are priceless.<br /><br />

A gift impossible to repay.<br /><br />

It's not all about work,<br />
Some people are jobless.<br />
It's not all about staying home on a cloudy day,<br />
Or sleeping in that extra hour.<br /><br />

Some people are homeless.<br /><br />

It's not all about age,<br />
Whatever's “cool,” the next big thing, and the latest rage.<br />
Some things are ageless, endless, and<br />
It's not all about you.<br /><br />

Or me.<br /><br />

It’s not all about friends,<br />
Some people are friendless.<br />
It's not all about looks,<br />
Some people are faceless.<br /><br />

And some people just can't see.</p>
