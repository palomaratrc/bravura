Timothy Sturis<br /><br />

She buries herself<br />
In a coffin of clothing,<br />
The shroud of her own conformity,<br />
Hiding who she is<br />
To everyone around her.<br />
The only glimpse inside,<br />
A bold swatch of leopard print,<br />
Glaring in the midday sun<br />
Says more about her than<br />
She knows.<br /><br />

The white Rastafarian<br />
His dirty dreads bobbing as he walks<br />
Dancing against his too tan skin.<br />
Does he want to believe in something<br />
From another culture, another world<br />
Or does he just like reggae<br />
And weed?<br /><br />

All around me<br />
The shuffle and slap of flip flops.<br />
Sloppy shoes for lazy people<br />
With no more ambition<br />
Than to make it through another day.<br />
Wherever they are going<br />
They clearly don’t plan on running there.
