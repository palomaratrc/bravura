Taylor Smith<br /><br />

I walk past dim-lit liquor stores and<br />
old shopping carts rusted to the bone,<br />
down alleyways riddled<br />
with outdated cheeseburgers<br />
and cigarette ashes, <br />
nod at my sometimes neighbor<br />
who has built walls of trash bags<br />
around himself<br />
for heat,<br />
jog up the stairs<br />
to my apartment,<br />
stumble over the couch,<br />
grab my new clothes,<br />
hot from the back of the truck<br />
my friend Vinnie drives,<br />
and check the machine<br />
for details about what’s going down tonight<br />
and when.<br />
No messages.
