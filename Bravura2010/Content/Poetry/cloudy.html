<span id="title">Cloudy Day</span><br />
Kezia Bechtoldt<br /><br />

My mind awoke to greet a cloudy day<br />
They weigh me down, these silent dreams of you<br />
I cannot leave my bed, I wish to stay<br /><br />

Can’t say I felt much better yesterday<br />
Each horizon failed to breathe a breakthrough<br />
My mind awoke to greet a cloudy day<br /><br />

Last week, I drove fast along the highway<br />
Headed west, unsure of what to pursue<br />
I could not leave those dreams, they wished to stay<br /><br />

Last month, I felt I’d kiss you somewhere midway<br />
Between my dreams and reality. I could not subdue<br />
My mind. I woke to yet another cloudy day<br /><br />

Last year, I calculated, tried to weigh<br />
The many deceptions I tried to undo<br />
You left, you walked away—I wish you’d stay<br /><br />

I’ll never breathe a word, go ahead—run away<br />
I’d chase you with my love, but I’d just come unglued<br />
My mind awoke to greet a cloudy day<br />
I cannot leave my bed, I wish to stay
