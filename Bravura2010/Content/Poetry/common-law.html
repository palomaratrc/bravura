Laura Zapico<br /><br />

Is it love or just the loss of a dream<br />
Of a family, together forever,<br />
That makes my small tasks harder than they seem?<br /><br />

I lament the things we did as a team;<br />
I do them alone and wonder whether<br />
It is love or just the loss of a dream.<br /><br />

The times when we used to bicker and scream<br />
I’ve nearly forgotten altogether.<br />
It makes my small tasks harder than they seem.<br /><br />

My heart is a rag doll, torn at the seam.<br />
No one will know me more deeply, never.<br />
Is it love or just the loss of a dream?<br /><br />

The weeds growing around your old Airstream<br />
Remind me there’s no hope whatsoever,<br />
Which makes my small tasks harder than they seem.<br /><br />

I could design some elaborate scheme<br />
To win you back, but I doubt I’d ever<br />
Know if it’s love or the loss of a dream<br />
That makes my small tasks harder than they seem.
