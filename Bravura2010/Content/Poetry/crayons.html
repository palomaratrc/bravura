<span id="title">Crayons</span><br />
Larissa Wise<br /><br /><br />


She liked my ink-stained jeans and<br />
I liked her teal ponytail, so I<br />
fished out the folded square with her number on it from<br />
the sea of tobacco and ashes in<br />
the bottom of my purse<br />
<span class="tab">and called her up.</span><br /><br /><br /> 


She was at the beach<br />
	<span class="tab">doing cartwheels and</span><br /> 
	<span class="tab">handstands against the wall</span><br />
with her Russian friend, and would I like to meet her cat<br /> 
when she got back?<br /><br /><br />


Over a blue mug of iced Ethiopian coffee we<br />
laid our crayons on the table and let the sun<br />
melt them together while I chewed on a toothpick<br /> 
<span class="tab">and arranged the splinters in</span><br />
the shape of an onion.<br /><br /><br /> 


I showed her a scab on my elbow<br />
and she showed me one on her wrist.<br />
We both cried, but blamed it on the onion.<br /><br /><br />


Over a feast of beer and wasabi chips one night she said<br />
that she smelled something, and maybe it was<br /> 
Old Spice, and the only<br />
reason she brought it up was because<br />
she wore the opium spray that her grandma wore and<br /> 
I wore a generic spray that was supposed to smell like the sea<br />
but smelled like vinegar<br /> 
mostly,<br />
and whose was it and why<br />
was it there?<br /><br /><br />


And we cried again but<br />
this time<br />
<span class="tab">there was no onion.</span>
