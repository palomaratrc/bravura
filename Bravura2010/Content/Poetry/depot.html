<span id="title">I Hate Home Depot</span><br />
Billy Ryan<br /><br />

9:05pm<br />
The store closed five minutes ago<br />
but one customer<br />
lingers in the back of the store<br />
examining ladders<br /><br />

9:24pm<br />
His plastic bags crinkle<br />
as he finally leaves.<br />
My friends have already<br />
taken off.<br />
Asshole.<br /><br />

9:37pm<br />
The doors exhale<br />
behind me<br />
and whisper shut.<br />
I pull out my wallet.<br />
One dollar<br />
to fill my sixteen gallon tank.<br /><br />

9:45pm<br />
Finally made it home.<br />
My tank’s still empty.<br /><br />

10:14pm<br />
Crashed on my bed,<br />
Coltrane on my iPod,<br />
A Coors Light in my hand.<br />
Tomorrow’s my day off.
