<span id="title">Drained</span><br />
Laura Zapico<br /><br />

remember how it felt<br />
when you learned you were pregnant<br />
and your man said he’d support you<br />
no matter your choice<br />
but then changed his mind<br /><br />

when he threatened you<br />
with an M-16<br />
lit off rounds in the yard<br />
in front of your five-year-old son<br />
and you had to find a way to explain<br /><br />

when you filed a restraining order<br />
but he came over anyway<br />
ripped the front door off the hinges<br />
broke the family pictures<br />
and hid down the street when the sheriff came<br /><br />

when he said he would do anything<br />
to make your life miserable<br />
and stayed true to his word<br />
until he met another woman<br />
and moved on<br /><br />

then when you are alone<br />
imagine your heart is a wound<br />
from which truth bleeds<br />
and bleed<br /> 
until you are drained</p>
