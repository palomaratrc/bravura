<span id="title">Prison Walls Echo</span><br />
Andrew Dickerman<br /><br />

thick concrete walls, cold steel plank benches.<br />
the fluorescent lights reveal<br />
the slick human grime and muck<br />
that has oiled all the surfaces.<br />
it casts everyone in its reach<br /> 
with blown out glows and long dark shadows.<br />
after several weeks without natural light<br />
the eyes get used to this<br />
artificial luminescence and the skin becomes sallow.<br />
we are not complete humans anymore<br />
but creatures<br />
between<br />
worlds.<br />
we exist like insects<br />
all fluttering and silent.<br />
our pupils expand until a black hollow is all that is left.<br />
pig faced deputies drop nectar by our cages<br />
and locust and dragonflies, alike<br />
reach in a torrent of limbs<br />
groping and screeching and never satisfied,<br />
never whole.<br />
a cool wind blows but<br />
we cannot feel it.<br />
we know somewhere winds lick the crests of sand dunes smooth.<br />
that upon some ancient peak<br />
a cold blast burdens packed ice.<br />
that winds all over are churning great dark bodies of water<br />
into other great dark waves<br />
that will move and froth,<br />
cleansing and absolving<br />
anything in their path.<br />
we know the divine breaths of air<br />
exist,<br />
somewhere, but we do not feel them<br />
because we are locked in the pits<br />
of someone’s forsaken castle.<br />
we are where sun and earth<br />
do not exist.<br />
where water and heart<br />
bleed dry.<br />
we are nowhere.<br />
the crevices and cracks of these walls<br />
are lined with the sediment<br />
of our souls.<br />
it is a heavy dust<br />
that cannot be brushed or blown away.<br />
eventually it will be<br />
all we have left<br />
to remind us of<br />
our former selves.<br />
sanity,<br />
like time<br />
becomes an indefinite concept.<br />
we know that both do not matter anymore<br />
but we like to pretend.<br />
we like to act as though we still have the ability to gauge sanity and time<br />
but we know that we do not.<br />
and it is good<br />
that we don’t<br />
because if we were truly capable of<br />
that kind of introspection<br />
we would not be able to handle<br />
what we would see.<br />
beyond our veils<br />
is now too much for us<br />
beneath our moist<br />
darkened eyes<br />
it is…
