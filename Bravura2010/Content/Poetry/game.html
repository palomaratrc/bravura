<span id="title">The Game</span><br />
Kezia Bechtoldt<br /><br />

Back home<br />
we’d trace the lines<br />
out on the ground<br />
with broken tree branches<br />
then used rough gray stones<br />
to mark where our dancing feet<br />
were not allowed to stray<br /><br />

We never had a name for the game<br />
but we recognized the rules<br />
as soon as the familiar grooves<br />
were drawn into the dust<br /><br />

Then we’d<br />
kick up dirt<br />
as if we owned the world<br /><br />

One day<br />
I flew across an ocean<br />
and landed somewhere<br />
clean and civilized—<br />
a land where<br />
children’s playgrounds<br />
confined grass, sand, and dirt<br />
into neat little boxes<br /><br />

I found the lines<br />
for this familiar game<br />
written out on concrete slabs<br />
with bright white paint<br /><br />

<span class="emph">Hopscotch,</span> they explained<br />
and I wanted to tell them<br />
that I know<br />
but they only nodded and smiled<br />
as my tongue tripped clumsily<br /><br />

Their smiles confused me<br />
and made my skin feel tight<br />
my joints unhinged<br />
until I stumbled<br />
as if I’d never seen those lines before<br />
as if I’d never played the game<br />
back home
