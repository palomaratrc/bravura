<span id="title">Shattered Glass</span><br />
Meggan LaRiviere<br /><br />

<span id="indent">Sitting</span> here surrounded by shattered glass—some colored, some clear, some shapes of arms, bodies and petals—<br />
in and around the wooden frame of the cabinet still perfectly shaped but missing its clear glass doors that showcased<br />
those priceless figurines bought for each anniversary, birthday, or just because I care moments. I’d smile as I walked<br />
in the door to find the package wrapped in a decorative bag and the same red bow placed on the top (because you<br />
knew how much I loved the color red) waiting patiently in the entry way just asking to be torn open. But the<br />
promises of all that glass—loving me, staying faithful, being my protector—are scattered on the floor around my<br />
feet. The wing from the ceramic bird you made because you thought of me as a bird, strong willed and always ready<br />
to spread my wings and fly away. Who knew you would be the first one to abandon the nest? The stems and petals<br />
of those green and yellow crystal flowers—you said that we would last until the day those flowers withered away.<br />
They weren’t supposed to wither away.  How could I know that day you went to work would be the day that you<br />
would never return?  I sit here telling myself each broken promise is room for  new butterflies, kisses that leave me<br />
breathless because they always feeling like the first. That perfectly shaped cabinet will one day fit itself back together,<br />
but this time with a new spotlight on pieces that are whole and solid and not shattered.
