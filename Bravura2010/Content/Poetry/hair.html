<span id="title">Grandma’s Hair</span><br />
Donna Dellinger<br /><br />

I stepped into the beauty supply shop.<br />
My sister followed me in.<br />
Boxes of hair dye on the wall<br />
Seemed to go on forever.<br />
The one we needed to buy would.<br /><br />

Neither of us had ever colored our hair.<br />
One thing we had in common.<br />
That and the freckles on our faces<br />
Except she kept hers under makeup.<br />
She was a fluffy redhead<br />
Still coiffed from the eighties.<br />
I was a dishwater blonde,<br />
Stringy and plain.<br /><br />

Grandma would be dressed in her light blue satin dress<br />
With the matching overlay of lace.<br />
Right now, her hair was grey<br />
Just as we had seen it in the hospital,<br />
Grey and wiry and wild.<br />
And that would not do.<br />
When we were to see it for the last time,<br />
It had to be &quot;her&quot; hair color,<br />
The one she had always chosen carefully,<br />
The one we would remember her by.<br /><br />

<span class="emph">Marmalade, Ginger, Sunset, Platinum.</span><br />
We read the enticing labels.<br />
We studied the pictures,<br />
And swatches of tints,<br />
And samples of shades.<br />
But it was none of those.<br />
Then we looked at each other,<br /> 
And we looked at each other’s hair.<br /><br />

The saleslady came up to us.<br />
&quot;May I help you?&quot; she asked with lipstick lips. <br />
&quot;We are trying to find the right color.&quot;<br />
There was only a hint of cracking in my sister’s voice.<br />
&quot;Who is it for?&quot; the lips continued.<br />
&quot;It’s for our grandmother,&quot; I replied.<br />
<span class="emph">Should we tell her what we’re doing?</span><br />
I could tell my sister was thinking the same thing,<br />
But she didn’t say anything about it either.<br /><br />

I lifted a wisp of my hair.<br />
My sister did the same.<br />
We stood close to each other.<br />
Our tilted heads touching,<br />
The strands intermixed,<br />
And we held them up.<br />
&quot;We’re looking for this color,&quot; I said.<br /><br />

The lady handed us two boxes –<br />
<span class="emph">Strawberry Shortcake and Sunshine.</span><br />
We bought them both to give to the man.<br />
Then my sister and I walked out of the store,<br /> 
Together.
