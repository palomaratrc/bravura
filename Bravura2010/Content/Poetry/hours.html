<span id="title">Visiting Hours</span><br />
Laura Zapico<br /><br />

Through a maze of heavy locked doors,<br />
illuminated fluorescent green,<br />
there’s a room furnished with couches— <br />
cast-offs, the fabric thinned by elbows<br />
and torn to the wood as if by cats<br />
sharpening their claws.<br />
There’s a grey-bearded man perched birdlike,<br />
unresponsive to the wife who sits murmuring,<br />
squeezing his knee.<br />
There’s a woman, milky-skinned,<br />
who pulls nits, imagined or real,<br />
from a nest of black hair<br />
and snaps them between her teeth.<br />
And there’s my mother,<br />
who except for her eyes,<br />
glassy and strange,<br />
looks the same as she did before<br />
she started talking about the Devil<br />
as someone she knew.<br />
Before she poured boiling soup on her thighs<br />
and stood beside the stove, enchanted,<br />
savoring each watery blister.
