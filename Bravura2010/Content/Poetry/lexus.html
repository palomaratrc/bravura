<span id="title">Gold Lexus</span><br />
Katherine Wegner<br /><br />

I took your arm that night,<br />
Your solid gray jacket suddenly<br />
Too close to my side.<br />
So we drove to the Yogurtland on Harbor<br />
In your gold Lexus.<br /><br />

You’d look at the road,<br />
And then turn to glance at me.<br />
I nodded, smiled, and<br />
Watched your neatly trimmed hands<br />
Cradle the steering wheel.<br /><br />

I listened to John Mayer’s<br />
Electric guitar wail as you talked.<br />
You talked of so many things—<br />
Of the visions and revisions<br />
Of being an artist, of creating life.<br /><br />

I’d yawn and watch<br />
The blue line of our GPS route and the red dot<br />
Of the gold Lexus moving in real time.<br />
I shivered on the leather seat<br />
And shut the air vents.<br /><br />

I’d stare at your thick lips and potato-shaped nose,<br />
Remembered the photography lesson<br />
In the back lot of Target.<br />  
My digital Kodak shuddered<br />
At your 35 mm SLR camera.<br /> 
Shuddered at those five pictures you have of me.<br /><br />

Mayer’s grainy voice sang of trains that never stop,<br />
Broken hearts that dreamed.<br />
So I didn’t notice when, still talking,<br />
You drove past Harbor<br />
And we never made it back.
