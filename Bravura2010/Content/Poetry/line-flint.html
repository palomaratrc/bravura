<span id="title">Red Line to White Flint</span><br />
Carroll Lee Allman<br /><br />

I saw a brave man,<br />
alone.<br />
He wore a neat, brown suit<br />
and shoes that shined expensively.<br /><br />

His hair was wavy,<br />
kempt,<br />
almost totally white,<br />
and his face was smooth,<br />
unlined.<br /><br />

He chewed gum<br />
and wore a wedding band.<br /><br />

With eyes slightly worried<br />
and blue,<br />
focusing on nothing,<br />
he stood<br />
(remembering how danger looks?)<br />
On his arm, an umbrella.<br />
In his hand,<br />
a long white cane,<br />
jointed and collapsible,<br />
its tip painted red.<br /><br />

At his stop he knew.<br />
The door opened;<br />
he hesitated.<br /><br />

But the car was nearly empty;<br />
two passengers exited carefully.<br /><br />

Quickly, tapping his cane,<br />
as if feeling his way<br />
with his fingers<br />
on the train's metal floor,<br />
he walked decisively,<br />
then haltingly strode,<br />
through the open door,<br />
as the chimes signaled<br />
imminent, mechanical obstruction.
