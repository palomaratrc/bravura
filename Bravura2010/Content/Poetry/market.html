<span id="title">At the Egg Liquor & Market</span><br />
Maria Mathioudakis<br /><br />

The bleach blonde manager<br />
asked me if I spoke Spanish.<br />
I lied<br />
and got hired on the spot.<br /><br />

The job involved a lot of memorization,<br /> 
she said,<br />
before they’d let me work on my own.<br />
Prices,<br />
signatures,<br />
faces. <br /><br />

&quot;Two-sixteen, señor.&quot;<br />
I have to point<br /> 
to the number flashing on the register<br />
because he doesn’t recognize the English<br />
from my lips.<br /> 
He smiles<br />
and I smile<br />
as he pulls a wad of<br />
bills out of his pocket<br />
and counts them out,<br />
wrinkled and<br />
damp.<br /><br />

By now<br /> 
I know<br />
I’m here to<br />
take their money,<br />
bag their booze,<br />
their Hostess Snowballs,<br /> 
their Orange Crush,<br />
stick matches in the bag<br /> 
with the Swisher Sweets.<br /><br />

I’m the one they see<br />
when they show up<br />
in the morning,<br />
hunched over,<br />
white breath<br />
stiff from the cold.<br /><br />

And I’m the one they see<br />
when they show up<br />
thirsty<br />
and lousy<br />
on their way home.<br />
I’m there all day<br />
behind the counter<br />
looking at the scars on their<br /> 
arms<br />
and the bags under their eyes.<br /><br />

I wonder<br />
if he’s paying with his coin collection<br />
because he’s going bankrupt.<br />
If his kid is crying because the dog ran away.<br />
If she’s drinking because her husband’s gone,<br />
or if her son knocked up a seventeen year old.<br /><br />

When it’s time to leave<br /> 
I count all the money<br />
lock the door<br />
sanitize my hands<br /> 
and drive home.<br />
