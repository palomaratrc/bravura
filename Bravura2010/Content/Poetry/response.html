Amy Genduso<br /><br />

Dear John,<br /><br />

What am I up to next?<br /><br />

I’m playing <span class="emph">Dance Dance Revolution</span>.<br />
Loving unconditionally<br />
an asthmatic wildcat.<br />
Tending to old people who<br /> 
scare years<br />
off of my life.<br />
Falling in love with ideas, as has become<br /> 
my nasty habit.<br />
The rest is speculation.<br /><br />

Yes, I’m back in town, but<br />
I don’t talk to Opal anymore,<br />
after her one visit to Austin<br />
when I noticed either she or I had changed a lot.<br /><br />

The black chicken died and the gold one went back<br /> 
to the farm where she was born,<br />
now bearing many chicks.<br /><br />

Thank you for the birthday note and package.<br /><br />

Love,
</p>
