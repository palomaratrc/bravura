Canyons so red they seem stained<br />
with the blood of a million births,<br />
a place with more curves than all<br />
the women in the world,<br />
a preternatural womb cradling a whole town of people<br />
as vulnerable as fetuses, gentle souls like shell-less turtles.<br />
This is their last chance to live in a decade they missed,<br />
in a haven with 31 flavors of freaks, none ready to leave Mother Earth<br />
for a future with straight lines and Humvees<br />
and polar bears with no ice<br />
and teenagers with crystal-encrusted iPhones.<br /><br />

Over a display of moonstones,<br />
the woman who reeks of patchouli and her girlfriend<br />
in the vegan Birkenstocks<br />
are discussing the matriarchal society<br />
that Christianity raped.<br />
Back then, the best a girl could hope for<br />
was equality in a tribe,<br />
praying to a goddess,<br />
or maybe ruling a clan after her husband died.<br />
But I don’t tell them their history sucks,<br />
that the theory of our dominion was debunked,<br />
that it’s a vague mythology.<br />
Everyone needs hope.<br /><br />

A man is signing his CD covers at a table<br />
beside the register<br />
for his adoring public of three people<br />
who ignore the clearance beads<br />
on the other half of the display.<br />
His music is vaguely Celtic with all sorts<br />
of forgotten instruments<br />
like the lute<br />
and he wears a lace-up tunic with his Kenny G hair<br />
curling around the collar.<br />
He talks with a fan about Wicca and Druidism<br />
with pronunciations and etymologies<br />
that would make a Celt blanch.<br /><br />

In the pottery section a woman my mother’s age<br />
is eyeing authentic pieces<br />
with a reverence reserved for holy artifacts.<br />
She has a yoga mat over her shoulder<br />
and a wolf on her t-shirt.<br />
She was definitely not born here.<br />
Maybe she came after her divorce;<br />
there’s a faded tan line in the shape of a ring on the hand<br />
she pressed nervously to her mouth.<br />
White guilt clings to her<br />
vaguely ethnic head wrap<br />
and her beaded sandals.<br />
I bet she wanted to be Native American when she grew up.<br />
I’d introduce her to Noe, the Navajo drug dealer,<br />
but he’d just bum her out.<br /><br />

&quot;Coexist&quot; bumper stickers are challenged only<br /> 
by Obama’s <span class="emph">Yes We Can!</span><br />
The owner behind the register<br />
(who could be Jerry Garcia’s twin)<br />
winks at me.<br />
We share a moment of recognition<br />
as we chat about the healing properties of Larimar,<br />
cleansing with salt or moonlight,<br />
and Aboriginal Australians<br />
using crystals to encourage dreaming.<br />
A lady asks us each to recommend a book.<br />
We’re happy to help because,<br />
after all,<br />
we’re all in this together.
