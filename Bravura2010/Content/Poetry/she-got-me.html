<span id="title">She Got Me</span><br />
Larissa Wise<br /><br />

I’ve got a friend who tells really cold lies<br />
When she’s hiding, she doesn’t miss a beat<br />
She will smile behind low lash-covered eyes<br /><br />

There was a time we had really strong ties<br />
We learned to dance to the step of our feet<br />
But I’ve got a friend who tells really cold lies<br /><br />

I showed her my image, maggots and flies<br />
A self-portrait, self-defaced and dirt cheap<br />
And she smiled behind low lash-covered eyes<br /><br />

She showed me a mask, just one such disguise<br />
Now it makes sense how she could never sleep<br />
I’ve got a friend who tells really cold lies<br /><br />

Time passed and I saw the monster arise<br />
It gleamed with the triumph of defeat<br />
And it smiled behind low lash-covered eyes<br /><br />

Behind her buttresses a white flag flies<br />
Now I’ve learned that it’s a trap and a cheat<br />
I’ve got a friend who tells really cold lies<br />
She will smile behind low lash-covered eyes
