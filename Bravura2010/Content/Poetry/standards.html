Laura Zapico<br /><br />

I will not tolerate a man<br />
who walks on his toes,<br />
who thinks his jokes are funny,<br />
who loads the dishwasher in a way<br />
that will never get the dishes clean,<br />
whose will I can bend<br />
with emotional outbursts,<br />
who cries when I am cruel.<br /><br />

I will not abide a man<br />
who spells poorly,<br />
who cannot change his oil,<br />
who tells me he loves me<br />
before I tell him,<br />
whose mother taught him<br />
everything he knows<br />
and ever wants to know.<br /><br />

I will not endure a man<br />
who tells me I’m pretty,<br />
who thinks I’m amazing,<br />
who treats me the way<br />
I always wanted to be treated,<br />
whose fragility shows<br />
in the way he strives <br />
to give me everything I need.
