<span id="title">Table for Two</span><br />
Jenna Jauregui<br /><br />

When a table is reserved for two,<br />
You think about marriage, romance, and wine.<br />
Two peas in a pod just like me and you.<br /><br />

But every Tuesday afternoon at two<br />
This old couple comes in, dressed to the nines,<br />
And gets seated at the table for two.<br /><br />

You’d think they would talk over the menu,<br />
But they order the same thing every time.<br />
That’s not the peculiar thing that they do.<br /><br />

Each brings a book. She prefers Nancy Drew,<br />
And he carries one with a worn-out spine.<br />
They sit and read at the table for two.<br /><br />

They don’t say a word; they sit there subdued<br />
And turn a page between bites as they dine.<br />
He with his story and she with her new<br /><br />

Novel, maybe taking an overdue<br />
Break from reality. I think that’s fine,<br />
But it’s odd to see that table for two,<br />
Their minds off in places that are not true.
