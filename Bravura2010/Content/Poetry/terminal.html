<span id="title">In the West Terminal of Bob Hope International</span><br />
Larry Narron<br /><br />

in the air-conditioned belly of this charmed snake,<br />
this anxious river that flows with the wreckage<br />
of bodies and light,<br />
vibrating oasis of souls that even now<br />
goes unnoticed<br />
by the near-sighted travel agents of the universe...<br />
i sit watching rapid wanderers drift<br />
on rubber currents<br />
that buoy them gently along to gates where<br />
airplanes mine them for the sky.<br />
these awkward businessmen are all<br />
fractured uncut gems gleaming hotel secrets,<br />
clutching their briefcases like grails or grenades.<br />
witness the much-coveted ore of tongue<br />
and flashing eye<br />
as women walk irritably by,<br />
their skin-calligraphy perfectly penned in blood,<br />
human odes to divinity,<br />
or divine odes to humanity . . .<br />
all these lost people, landlocked & airborne,<br />
flying and falling and flying again,<br />
a billion shimmering sparks spinning wildly<br />
across heaven’s cellar floor.
