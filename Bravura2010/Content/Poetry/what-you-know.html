<span id="title">Write What You Know</span><br />
Ian Adelman<br /><br />

Think about your father’s gold watch<br />
the one with the cracked glass<br />
and the second hand that turns backward.<br />
Think about your mother’s first perm<br />
the sheer volume of brown oiled curls<br />
and how she burned each and every<br />
picture taken of her.<br />
Think about Sue standing<br />
underneath an ivy archway<br />
and how you walked away<br />
without kissing her.<br />
Think about Bobby<br />
seven inches taller than you<br />
knocking you to the floor<br />
with one uppercut.<br /><br />

Lie<br />
about all of them<br />
make them work in a story<br />
or poem.<br /><br />

Like this:<br />
Fist flies and a lucky uppercut<br />
lands square on Bobby’s chin.<br />
Sue grasps my hand.<br />
pulling me under the green ivy arch.<br />
Our lips lock and my heart beats<br />
like father’s gold watch<br />
with the second hand<br />
ticking backward.<br /><br />

Or this:<br />
I see red leaves on trees—<br />
clocks whose hands run backwards—<br />
before I fall off a red rock cliff.<br />
As I hurtle down<br />
I think about my mother’s hair<br />
gleaming golden curly oil.<br />
I think about the first girl I kissed<br />
under a green ivy arch.
