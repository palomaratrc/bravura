<span id="title">When Night Comes Around</span><br />
Joe Rodriguez<br /><br />

Past the veranda I sat by myself<br />
Drinking and thinking about the good life<br />
Soaking up the sun and foregoing my health<br />
Who here needs the nagging pains of a wife?<br />
I sway the bottle and refill my glass<br />
And look to where her garden had once bloomed<br />
We moved in last June, made love on the grass<br />
The lilacs she planted wither and croon.<br />
It isn’t so bad here in the daylight<br />
If only the sun would stay in the sky<br />
A violet static hums into the night<br />
Lying in bed I can hear lilacs cry.<br />
The day has undone, the sun has gone down<br />
Everything changes when night comes around.
