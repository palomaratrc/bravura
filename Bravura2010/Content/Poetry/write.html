<span id="title">Midnight &quot;Write&quot;</span><br /><br />
Elizabeth Everett<br /><br /><br /><br />


&quot;The ideas are coming!&quot; &quot;The ideas are coming!&quot;<br /><br /> 
I awake with a start<br /><br />
This time I’m prepared to battle<br /><br />
Be still my heart<br /><br />
The ideas course thru me<br /><br />
My insides reverberating with each gallop<br /><br />
This is it, there is no other option<br /><br />
Battle is imminent<br /><br />
I have been taxed by ideas for way too long<br /><br />
I gather my words to right this wrong<br /><br />
My words gather in anticipation<br /><br />
With the same goal in relation<br /><br />
No more taxation without representation!<br /><br /><br /><br />
 
My words, my troops<br /><br />
They stand at attention<br /><br /> 
Then size themselves up in word formation<br /><br />
One in formation , starts with a “C”<br /><br />
Unabashedly approaches me<br /><br />
&quot;Please sir, if I may<br /><br />
Before this war goes underway<br /><br />
There are a few things I’d like to say-&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />
 
&quot;This is going to be an uphill battle<br /><br />
If you fall, get back up on that saddle<br /><br />
Don’t be up the creek without a paddle<br /><br />
For we have reached the point of no return,<br /><br />
Where a lesson taught, is a lesson learned<br /><br />
And a dollar spent, is a dollar earned!&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />
 
&quot;Stop! Say no more!&quot;, I do beseech<br /><br />
Your cadence of words figure of speech<br /><br />
But nothing to my troops did you teach<br /><br />
Progress- a dog, you’d be the leash<br /><br />
Inspiration -blood, you’d be the leech<br /><br />
All those things we’ve heard before,<br /><br />
Soldier, I have no use for you anymore<br /><br />
You are trite and overused<br /><br />
As effective as a bomb without a fuse<br /><br />
Cliché, from duty, you are excused<br /><br /><br /><br />
 
Words resized and ready to fight<br /><br />
We march steadily into the night<br /><br />
Towards the onslaught of ideas<br /><br /> 
They’re a formidable sight<br /><br />
Yet my troops march on, absent of fright<br /><br /><br /><br />
 
The ideas were now within reach<br /><br />
As I struggled to get my words under control<br /><br />
I noticed the ideas begin to slow<br /><br />
What was happening? Where was their flow?<br /><br />
Why? It just didn’t make sense<br /><br />
My words seemed to lose their confidence<br /><br />
Tense? Tense? Oh I was past tense<br /><br />
&quot;But that’s not proper,&quot; grammar stated<br /><br />
Above all else, proper or not<br /><br />
We must adhere to our wiles<br /><br />
Those ideas must be caught<br /><br />
Sticking to rules is a paralyzing resin<br /><br />
Yes most definitely pun was intended<br /><br />
Mirthfully I returned to the present<br /><br /><br /><br />
 
Ideas and words meet in collision<br /><br />
Battle plan in constant revision<br /><br />
 &quot;Spell, check and see if the words are still in formation&quot;<br /><br />
He quickly returns, speaking of dissention<br /><br />
&quot;The sentences are fragmented, sir, what’s your position?&quot;<br /><br />
&quot;Make sure concepts there to provide supervision-<br /><br />
Now is not the time for a sentence division!&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />
 
Capturing ideas is no easy feat<br /><br />
They attempt to abscond<br /><br />
Willing my words to retreat<br /><br />
Unfortunate for them, we refuse defeat<br /><br />
Ideas in their heads, my words and I beat<br /><br /><br /><br />
                                                        
My words descend into the valley of conclusion<br /><br />
Words, ideas, concepts<br /><br />
A strong, eclectic fusion<br /><br />
Still this shan’t warrant any grand illusions<br /><br />
I rally my troops, they stand in confusion<br /><br />
Quickly I extinguish their blazing delusions<br /><br /><br /><br />
 
Dare you words quiescent?<br /><br />
Our battle skills are merely nascent<br /><br />
For every win, failure will be adjacent<br /><br />
Let this be true, let there be no mistaken<br /><br />
Victory, I pray thee, stay forever latent<br /><br /> 
Let it be to you we are perpetually racing<br /><br />
Hide yourself- l’est we become too complacent<br /><br /><br /><br />
 
You words want to celebrate<br /><br />
You want to relax<br /><br />
Well more ideas are coming<br /><br />
And they’re coming fast<br /><br />
This lull in fighting, writing won’t last<br /><br />
Take up arms<br /><br /> 
Pen, musket<br /><br />
Paper, ax<br /><br />
Pray thee not be unarmed when the ideas attack<br /><br />
That minor skirmish, I say with a laugh,<br /><br />
T’was nothing more than a paragraph<br /><br /><br /><br />
 
Capture more ideas<br /><br />
On them we will feed<br /><br />
My words wont die, for ideas they will bleed<br /><br />
Humbled now, my words take heed<br /><br />
Regaining their bearing, respecting my lead<br /><br />
Remember, my words, forever and after<br /><br />
Ideas are our slaves, they will remain in capture<br /><br />
In remembrance of the hard won battle of chapter<br /><br /><br /><br />
