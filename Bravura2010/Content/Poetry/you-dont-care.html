<span id="title">You Don’t Care</span><br />
Fabiola Martinez<br /><br />

I ask myself if maybe<br />
You’ll get at least a shattered piece of my heart.<br />
I ask myself if through all my damnations and frenzy,<br />
May you get at least one of my reproaches.<br /><br />

When I dream about it, I smile maliciously.<br />
It makes me believe you haven’t forgotten me.<br />
In spite of all the bad things we lived through,<br />
I think there’s still room in your heart for me.<br /><br />

Sometimes, I hallucinate and even believe<br />
You miss me.<br />
However, I know you well, and crestfallen, I accept that<br />
You do not care about me at all.
