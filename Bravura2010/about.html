		<p>Established in 1959, Bravura is an award winning literary magazine featuring writing by the Palomar College community. Exploring a 			variety of genres&#45;from fiction and poetry to graphic art and rap&#45;the journal provides a forum for emergent talent in the San Diego area. 		Many writers and artists featured in the journal have gone on to publish work elsewhere after publishing in the journal.<br /><br /> 

		In this challenging age for all literary endeavors, particularly journals, Bravura benefits from continued support from a variety of 			sources. While the journal is produced by the English Department at Palomar College, it would not exist without the following funders:
		<br /><br />
		The President's Association<br />
		The Students of Palomar College<br />
		Donations<br /><br />

		Thank you for your continued support.</p>
