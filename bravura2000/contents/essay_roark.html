  <b><font SIZE="6">
  <p ALIGN="CENTER">Hello Children, It</font><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols" SIZE="6">=</font><font SIZE="6">s

  </font></b><font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A</font>Mending means less spending, stitches lead not to
  riches. . .<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> These beautifully
  elaborate and catchy rhymes incessantly droning, from carefully placed ceiling
  speakers, into the slumbering and receptive ears of the children comfortably
  nestling in their systematically placed and immaculately clean beds at the
  local conditioning center in Aldous Huxley<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s
  <i>A Brave New World,</i> seem to mirror, or echo, or fundamentally define our
  goal for a popular, complacently lucid ideology for tomorrow<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s
  cooperative mentality. We must keep this economic wheel turning if we are
  going to reach our goal. And if your serotonin level isn<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t
  high enough to cope with the often mundanely-perfect monotony that accompanies
  the clock punching precision and uniformity of today<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s,
  industry driven, school preparation, well, we<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>ll
  just have to change your brain chemistry. Because, you see, today, it is much
  easier to <i>change your mind</i> than it is to adjust the environment which
  compels your awkward neurology to manifest raucous, free willed and
  uncontrollable behavior.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In today<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s world
  we just slap an ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) placard on your chest and
  send you into an amphetamine frenzy which will irresistibly urge you to be a
  valuable component to our society and GET YOUR WORK DONE. After all, the
  short-lived civilization that has come closest to grasping humanity<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s
  ultimate goal of total efficiency was the one that introduced <i>speed</i> to
  the world. Just take these Ritalin pills and the distractions holding you back
  from the rewards of a JOB WELL DONE will be things of the past.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why use Ritalin rather than more common amphetamines? Well
  the logical answer to that is straight-economics, my friend. According to
  clinical psychiatrist Dennis H. Clark, <font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>Ritalin
  is a different chemical from cocaine and amphetamines, it has almost an
  identical effect with two important differences. First, milligram per
  milligram, Ritalin is more potent than cocaine or amphetamines. Second, the
  effects of Ritalin last longer than cocaine or the amphetamines.<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>
  So you see, it would be a terrible blunder and a crime against efficiency to
  use such weaker versions of stimulation. We intend for you to get your moneys
  worth.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You are not alone! Don<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t
  you worry. There are many little girls and boys just like you who are just as
  unconventionally special. But we<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>ve
  been able to cure them too! Salon Magazine reports that <font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>prescriptions
  for psychoactive drugs for children has increased three fold in the last
  decade<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> and states that <font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>over
  3 million American children get Ritalin to control their hyperactivity or cut
  through their lassitude.<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font> More and
  more youngsters like yourself are being placed beneath the lobotomy-like
  blissfulness of our blanket of assimilation. You won<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t
  feel compelled to make your own decisions any longer, or be bothered by pesky
  feelings of boredom or internal anxiety. Ritalin<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s
  blinding ability to cloak useless sensation, and the direction it provides you
  with will make your time slide by more quickly and more productively than you
  ever thought possible. Long gone will be the days when you spent your time
  distractedly idling about somewhere upon the vast and ambiguous peripheral.
  You<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>ll enter the tunnel-vision of
  success with a vigorous tenacity, ever keeping your <i>eye on the prize</i>.
  Never mind that according to the research of free lance writer Arthur Allen,
  the affliction requiring this prescription is <font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>diagnosed
  roughly ten times as often (in the United States) as in Europe or Japan.<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>
  The heads of these national bodies obviously aren<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t
  capable of sacrificing their moral and ethical solidarity for the good of the
  whole.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This pharmaceutical assault on inefficient personality
  types promises to cease the controversy-promoting aspects of life; to lull the
  moral majority into complete social harmony. Useless, distracting, and often
  ridiculously personal things like art, music, dance, literature, philosophy,
  and religion, will all be things of the past once we can weed out the genetic
  defect which coaxes potentially good and productive citizens to waste their
  time with such atavistic endeavors.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The symptoms of this defect are disastrous to the economy
  we as a nation depend on for survival. The sordid behaviors include
  inattention, unwillingness to accomplish assigned tasks, organizational
  difficulties, misplacement of items, tendency to become distracted,
  forgetfulness, and possibly the most disturbing of all: excessive talking.
  These symptoms are a cancer on the more-than-adequately-provided-for children
  of today and threaten to corrode the social devices that weaves the industrial
  fabric providing us with our lavish comfort.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So don<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>t feel
  bad, or different because you have to take this drug in order to successfully
  merge with your environment, <i>our environment.</i> After all, that<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s
  what the drug is for! We want all our children to be nice, happy little people
  who, in turn, will eventually become nice, happy big people, meticulously
  paying attention to the details of production and the trends of consumption.
  As <i>soma</i> was to Huxley<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</font>s
  fictional utopia of <font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>our Ford,<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>
  Ritalin will be to our society: <font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">A</font>All
  the advantages of Christianity and alcohol without the defects.<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">@</font>
  <i>Ritalin Uber Alles!</p>
  </i>
