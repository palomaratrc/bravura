  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A soft rustling of leaves immediately follows the loud pop
  of escaping air as about four or five birds take flight in a mad panic from
  their roosting posts. Blue, red and yellow wings of primary colors flap
  furiously against a backdrop of cirrus clouds and tall mountains. Their
  combined effort in fleeing makes a noise almost identical to that of the
  zipping B.B., which had sliced its way through their dense foliage homestead
  two seconds earlier. Alex and Eric’s squinting eyes trace their erratic
  flight path upwards, until the sun makes it nearly impossible to continue any
  further. Sweat runs in a meandering trail from Eric’s hairline, pauses for a
  moment at his Neanderthal brow ridge and then drops straight into his deep-set
  eyes. &quot;Motherfucker!&quot; he winces in salty agony, kicking up clouds of
  dirt and burying his shaven head into dirty fingernailed hands. Bushes rustle
  and leaves dance; mocking squawks fill the air. Eric raises a tortured face to
  the cirrus sky and fires off a few rounds, revealing cavitied molars as he
  shouts uselessly into his surroundings.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;You feelin’ alright man?&quot; Alex asks, genuine
  concern evidently written in the creases on his face. He watches Eric sulk and
  come close to tears, hunched over; he sucks back snot and saliva, showing
  inflamed eyes and an inhuman scowl. Alex turns politely away, crunch of dirt
  under pivoting shoes and eyes rotating orbitally in their respective sockets;
  he takes in the exaggerated peaks and valleys of mountains in the distance.
  Except for the occasional wisp of water vapor in an expanse of monochrome, the
  sky is blue and uniform and almost unbearably boring as far as the eye can
  see. He chews the inside of his cheek, shuffles feet, and inspects his shirt
  for grime. Eric still doesn’t respond; Alex turns to face him. Alex’s
  scrutinizing gaze looks Eric up and down but can’t find any indication that
  he had been crying. He stands there, ten paces from Alex, feet brought smartly
  together. The B.B. gun dangles precariously from the limp index finger of his
  right hand.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Your turn.&quot; Eric says with intended drama. He
  cracks a smile desperately in need of braces, stalagmite teeth jut and crowd
  in the cramped quarters of his mouth. With a Doc Holiday flourish he brings
  the sun glinted carbon black weapon to chest level. He holds it stiff-armed
  straight out in front, barrel facing chin, butt end facing out. But Alex doesn’t
  see any arm; all he sees is an eerie midnight gun handle suspended in midair
  as if by marionette strings, just waiting for him to accept. A car honks
  rudely at someone from way down below. They crane their necks to look. Some
  type A personality fuck driving a car that’s way too good for him. Alex
  swivels back. The last vestiges of wicked smile retreat from Eric’s
  glistening face.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I told you before, I don’t care if you want to do
  this, just don’t expect me to,&quot; Alex reasons. Alex whips around,
  turning his body along with his head. He wrenches his spine this way and that.
  No birds enter the periphery of his visual field, a swell of relief washes
  through stomach and into extremities. Though he can hear families of them
  singing complex interwoven melodies from surrounding bushes. The telltale
  signs of impatience start to surface and slink across Eric’s countenance.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Don’t be a pussy!&quot; Eric raises his voice in
  exasperation. He somehow manages to get another inch out of a fully extended
  arm; shoving the gun still closer to a reluctant Alex. Alex’s sheepish hand
  reaches out. The handle’s finish of tiny pointy metal diamonds stamps red
  and white indentations on his clammy palm. The wind picks up some, Eucalyptus
  branches sway noisily, littering the soil below with oblong leaflets that
  writhe and twist until they find a suitable home among their brethren. A lone
  bird of spotted brown and black alights on a branch of the cherry blossom tree
  at the far end of the yard. Gravity’s appetite for the gun Alex is holding
  intensifies along with the wind, at the moment he thinks it feels heavy enough
  to be the real thing in his pasty fingers. His stomach turns. Glancing
  furtively at Eric, and exerting much effort, he raises the gun to eye level,
  both hands trembling severely. Had he been looking through a power scope just
  then, he would have seen a magnified bird head framed by two thin hairs of a
  shaky cross, eliciting sympathy by way of playful chirps and tilting of its
  ruffled neck. But with this gun at this distance, the bird looks like nothing
  more than a muddy blob, an outgrowth of the branch on which it perches. Eric’s
  breathing gets heavier and more annoying the longer Alex waits. He steadies
  three blurry rectangles that make up the sight in front one opened eye—his
  left one. Photons bounce and scatter off brown feathers, penetrate corneal
  shield and flit energetically onto an awaiting retina. Alex screws up his face
  in disbelief. The bird resembles a bat, hanging upside down roughly 30 feet in
  front of his opened eye. What the bloody he…Electric impulses spark and jolt
  along fibrous channels of optic nerve, branching out into synaptic pathways.
  They flood and drown the occipital lobe, polarity alternates; gray matter
  clunks along mechanically, a mouse runs on its wheel. The bird is now a bird
  again, standing right side up, singing a song; making its presence known to
  the world. That’s better. Sensing the trigger’s metallic bite against his
  index finger; Alex applies incremental pressure, one infinitesimal muscular
  contraction at a time. Eric’s hot breath tickles the nape of Alex’s neck
  as it condenses and trickles down to his shirt collar, where it vanishes into
  100% cotton.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Compressed gas gushes out of the barrel’s tiny opening.
  Echoes ricochet off the fence’s wooden planks in the smallish confines of
  the yard, not bothering to chew first; greedily swallowing Alex and Eric
  whole. As the slowly echoes die down, angry squawks from all around the yard’s
  perimeter rise up to fill in the resounding silence. A shapeless clump of
  speckled brown and black dradles counterclockwise off its perch, and plummets
  gracelessly to the ground. &quot;Nice shot,&quot; Eric’s excitement cuts
  forcefully through Alex’s queasiness. Two pairs of sneakered feet and tight
  laces trot towards the cherry blossom tree. No longer a blob, the struggling
  bird twitches and flaps frantically with its one operative wing; making
  fruitless circles in its efforts to fly away. A bare patch of lawn frames its
  broken body. Lying on its side, a single shiny black eye stares up at Alex,
  muffled chirps depart from its fragile beak. Wind chimes throw hollow tones
  into the air. Sweat runs down and itches. The two boys turn inwardly to look
  at each other. &quot;You’ve got to put it out of its misery,&quot; Eric
  says, using an inflection that Alex can’t distinguish as sarcastic or
  serious. The same gastrointestinal sting from before radiates outwardly from
  his interior.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Me!? I didn’t even want to shoot the thing in the
  first place.&quot; He pleads, using his own eyes to delve into Eric’s flat
  brown ones, but they are the eyes of a cow. There is nothing in them, nothing
  at all.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Give it here then.&quot; Eric relents, snapping his
  fingers impetuously and ripping the weapon from Alex’s uncertain grasp. Eric’s
  grubby fingers wrap themselves tightly around the handle. His knuckles turn
  white and his fingernails purple. &quot;This is how it’s done,&quot; he half
  whispers unwaveringly, his voice as sure as his grip. He lowers the gun
  towards the spent bird from up above, holding it down and sideways. Something
  about the gun’s awkward position in his hand reminds Alex of a street
  hoodlum. The bushes and trees go quiet; rustling fades then stops altogether.
  Eric’s upper lip curls back in a talented Matt Damon smile to reveal jagged
  teeth. Alex can see slimy indications of tongue glimmering through clenched
  spaces. The sun above is shining bright, intense, yellow. Illuminated by a
  grimace, Eric’s face turns ugly(er). &quot;Give me a count!&quot; he
  demands.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The thunderous power of rapidly expanding carbon dioxide
  blasts outward from the gun’s epicenter. Everything goes quiet. Miniature
  bones give and crack. One final copper insult lodges itself into the dying
  bird’s proud breast. It stops fluttering instantly. Two speechless boys
  stand there in all encompassing motionlessness; even the wind chimes have
  ceased to dance. Alex’s head hangs heavy off the end of his neck. His
  downcast eyes observe a change in the deceased bird’s shiny black orb, which
  looks to Alex like one big pupil.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It’s the day after, and Eric doesn’t come over. The
  kitchen clock acts as a metronome for Alex’s shifting mandible. He operates
  his teeth and tongue unconsciously and purely methodically. Amylase goes to
  work, taste buds light up, but he derives no pleasure from it. The food tastes
  bland. It has no discernable texture, like oatmeal. His eyes swivel downward
  by several degrees. Imagine that?? It is oatmeal. A joyless smile stretches
  his mouth and gains momentary control over his face for one…two…three
  ticks; he can’t help it. The slightly whitish glared clock face shows it’s
  ten in the morning and the June gloom outside is already beginning to break up
  and reveal patches of blue. Alex wonders if the sky is going to be just the
  same as yesterday. He concentrates on the back and forth and lateral movements
  of his jaw and the churning of gastric juices. Chew, grind, gulp, digest,
  assimilate. An unrecognizable sound splits from the backyard and snatches his
  attention away from the tick, tick, ticking of second hand quartz movement. It’s
  a rustling of sorts, very faint, almost nonexistent. An irrational wave of
  fear rises and subsides in Alex; motion picture scenes from Hitchcock play
  themselves out cinematically behind tightly shut lids. Warily, he pulls the
  sliding glass door halfway open. He raises a slippered foot over its dusty
  aluminum track. The air is dewy, invigorating. The hush of traffic wells up
  from below. An occasional cretin performs a peel out for an easily impressed
  girlfriend. Stepping off a redwood deck that’s seen better days, he scans
  the yard thoroughly, but spies nothing quite so paranormal as what he’d
  imagined. At the yard’s northernmost edge, the neighborhood cat, a pillowy
  ball of white and orange stripes crouches amidst starving grass. Its vertebrae
  stand plainly visible atop a fiendishly arched back. Alex habitually scratches
  his crotch. The cat wields a curious paw at a dirty, feathered carcass,
  molesting the balsa wood body as if it were no more than a tangled ball of
  brown and black yarn. A light breeze blows and Eucalyptus leaves drizzle down.
  The mangy fur ball prods and pokes, wholly absorbed in its task of showing
  utter disrespect for the dead. Alex feels a clot of oatmeal slowly making its
  way down his constricted throat.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Why don’t you get the fuck out of here!?&quot; Alex
  surprises himself with the level of emotion in his voice, wondering at the
  same time why he bothers to use words; or profanity for that matter on a cat.
  A shocked and whiskered feline face shoots up, propels its sleek head and
  tufted parabolic ears in quick darting spurts. Its body stiffens and freezes
  briefly; nose to the wind. Then resumes its play, exhibiting newfound
  interest. An inexplicable flash of hatred boils from deep down up to Alex’s
  face. His temperature rises, heartbeat escalates, mercury elevates. He stops
  scratching his groin. This new sensation, even more compelling than the
  equally spontaneous fear he’d felt minutes earlier pounds at near migraine
  intensity against his temples. A war cry escapes his lungs. His foot whistles
  through a low-density molecular lattice of mostly nitrogen and oxygen. One big
  toe finds its mark between the startled cat’s 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup>
  vulnerably exposed ribs. His toenail drills into the space between bones with
  the moral nonchalance of punting a football (and the fence but a goalpost). An
  irate and hurt growl emanates from the cat’s larynx and finds reverberation
  against Alex’s eardrum. The cat soars gracefully through one cubic meter of
  air after the other, as if it had merely jumped several parcels away from its
  prize. It touches down in one of the few spots where the grass is still
  relatively green, making about as big a thud as one can expect from a cat.
  Loose dirt billows around its padded feet. The wiry tomcat’s almost feminine
  eyes glower at Alex, the sunlight hitting them just so. The expression on its
  face and the droop of its whiskers both display the unquestionably feline
  trait of valuing complacency over vindictiveness. A stretch of ice plant
  slopes just to the right of the cat. Tiny purple flowers and yellow stamens.
  It pauses there momentarily in ankle high grass to lick its wounds, a rough
  pink tongue smoothing down matted fur. The tongue circulates to lick chops.
  Then, without so much as casting its haunted irises back, it bounds hurriedly
  over a splintery fence. Its tail surges to straight up. Its crusty asshole
  plainly visible as it sinks over the wooden slatted vista.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The day after that, Alex surveys every quadrangle of his
  backyard for potential feline riffraff. Neither the cat from yesterday nor
  anything else lies in sight. He walks evenly through an ongoing battle between
  grass and weeds over to the far end of the yard. He probes his index finger
  around on bent knees, fingering this way and that, parting Eucalyptus debris.
  A putrid odor tendrils up and into nasal passages. It worms its way past cilia
  and humid air. The mutilated corpse’s cavernous sockets stare back at him,
  ants crawl in and out. Insects of every lineage have all come to partake of
  this grand smorgasbord. They pulsate and swim in a disgusting second skin that
  covers nearly every grid of the birds decaying body. Alex tilts his head back
  and closes his eyes. The smell disperses slightly. The air feels heavy against
  his bare arms and neck. The ground softens and muddies around planted knees.
  Barely noticeable weightless drops fall on shut eyelids. He opens his eyes
  again, a symphony of clouds undulate and ripple across the carefully
  orchestrated sky. A new feeling swells and stretches in his chest. A totally
  foreign emotion wraps itself around Alex’s midsection and hugs him tightly.
  He springs up and makes a beeline for the stucco shed attached to the north
  side of his house. He pulls forcefully on a thin elastic cord, a bare bulb
  flickers on and casts sickly yellow. Alex deliberates momentarily, then wraps
  moist fingers around a white and rust colored paint chipped garden shovel. The
  starlet cord shimmies and shows off under the green-yellow limelight.
  Sprinkles fall and adhere to his dew drop hair. He hunches down at the far end
  of the yard, and scoops up the deceased, along with some residual soil and
  insects. Stepping across the deck, his free hand parts the sliding glass door.
  He walks to the kitchen, dropping bits of dirt along the way. The rain’s
  strength oscillates on the roof. A steady stream of lukewarm faucet water
  cascades around the bird’s lifeless body. Darkly colored impurities wash
  down the drain. They swirl in a muddy funnel, empty gurgling noises spill out
  from around lime deposits, where blades spin from down below. Cooking tongs in
  hand, he lifts the freshly cleaned bird up to the light of the kitchen window.
  Except for the absence of its eyes, it still looks somewhat animated. The
  sebaceous shine of a teenager’s forehead reflects off its oily feathers.
  Alex squarely places a clear glass jar on top of the sink’s plastic rack and
  carefully drops in the dripping bird headfirst. He turns the lid securely and
  repeatedly until his hand and wrist throb, so as to prevent an olfactory
  assault in the days to come. Sprinkles tap lightly against the windowpane.
  Alex takes both dishwater hands, and grips the jars rounded top. His fingers
  and thumbs make a circle around the lid as he lowers the jar neatly among
  flowerpots and trinkets set here and there on the kitchen windowsill
  overlooking the backyard.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clouds zoom and dissipate from one horizon to the other in
  fast motion, as they do in some modern movie trying to portray the passage of
  time. Calendar pages tear and fly off the wall, then flutter haphazardly to
  the ground. The remainder of summer goes by all too fast. Once school starts
  up again Alex’s days go by like clockwork. Tick, tock, cruel, clock. Larger
  and larger chunks of feather and flesh fall to the jarred bird’s feet. They
  shrink smaller and smaller as clouds streak by, and finally disappear
  altogether. Until all that remains is a chalky skeleton, the glint of copper
  showing just inside its accosted ribcage. One winter morning while eating a
  bowl of cereal Alex glances up at the kitchen window. He crunches flakes and
  stares through the jar’s transparency into the yard beyond. There, at the
  far end of the yard stands the cherry blossom tree, its pink blossoms now
  varied shades of maroon, dried and crisp and fallen to the Earth; just begging
  to be trampled on.</p>
