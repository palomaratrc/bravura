  <p>All along the watery horizon above Grenalda Bay, crimson, pink, and violet
  swirled like paints on a canvas, casting a serene shadow over the broken
  coast. In the wake below the sunset, a single tiny fishing vessel slowly
  trickled a path across the otherwise untouched water.</p>
  <p>As the colors in the sky began to fade into night, shadows of all sizes and
  intentions overtook the gloomy forest surrounding the city of Grenalda.
  Shadows cast by the city walls, crafted high from centuries-old architecture,
  began to blanket the city in a similar darkness as the night danced merrily
  through the streets, eating at the very people who lived on them.</p>
  <p>As if in a universal balance, fireflies of light awakened across the
  various neighborhoods. Torches burned and candelabras ignited, casting the
  demons of darkness away for yet another cold night.</p>
  <p>For the humans dwelling in Grenalda, such conveniences stood necessary for
  survival, naturally. Lost in a claustrophobic environment of winding alleys
  and high buildings, the inhabitants of the city had grown accustomed to the
  ominousness of their daily life. Illumination from manufactured sources was no
  less important to the human way of life as water, and they took it for granted
  just as much. To the humans (though particularly to the Grenaldans), nature
  had always been a thing to be consumed and used up. Resources of the land
  supplied basic necessities like timber, water, and rich dirt to plant crops.
  Over time, the immediate areas around the dark city walls had become stale,
  lifeless husks of former glory. Those who drew reserves from the land had
  spread like the wingspan of a large carrion eater, farther and farther from
  the protection of Grenalda’s notoriously anti-non-human city guard.</p>
  <p>Deeper the tainted hand of humanity spread, reaching needy fingers toward
  the southern forests of Soshan Wood. A mighty empire once stood here,
  dominated by nature’s protector, the elven race: peaceful and in tune with
  the harmony around them, though fierce in battle and willing to die for the
  protection of their home.</p>
  <p>And so it went. Humanity washed over the magical kingdom and left little
  behind in its wake. The grand forests remained mostly empty now, populated by
  scattered villages of humans, elves, and monstrous denizens alike.</p>
  <p>Perched high atop one of his favorite lookout spots in the city, Deyvon
  often pondered the differences in his ancestry, both human and elven. It tore
  him apart like a frail strip of fabric.</p>
  <p>He scanned the dark skies to the south but saw only a limitless void across
  the land. Somewhere out there, deep against the black horizon, stood the
  forests where he had lived and grown. He sometimes used them to hide when his
  activities had alerted the attention of one too many city guardsmen. They
  served him well as a place to lie low, but he also knew how dangerous it was
  to stay there for very long. Anything could come along in those forests, from
  a pack of hungry, wild animals to a marauding band of goblins. Wilderness
  survival wasn’t exactly Deyvon’s strong suit.</p>
  <p>Strange as it may have been, the half-elf felt safer within the confines of
  Grenalda. The city guard may be intolerable toward non-humans, but at least
  they were predictable. Deyvon had attributed his life to that fact on several
  different occasions.</p>
  <p>Turning his attention toward the city rooftops again, he spotted a pair of
  warm bodies with his elven vision. Two larger, human figures crept along the
  tower buttress in his direction. Deyvon had partnered up with these men,
  Falbagar and Gamor, in recent weeks to achieve a common goal: lightening the
  satin-laced pockets of wealthy merchants and nobles of valuables worth more
  money than they would ever spend for the rest of their lives.</p>
  <p>Their alliance didn’t totally comfort the young half-elf. From his own
  experience and observation, Deyvon found humans a perplexing lot, oftentimes
  speaking one thing yet intending another. To trust himself with fellow thieves
  was a risky gambit as well, but such was the life he had to live.</p>
  <p>In the lead, Falbagar reached the end of the wall and signaled up to Deyvon.
  They had found a good place to work. Silently, Deyvon secured the end of his
  rope to a flagstaff on the guard tower roof he sat upon and vaulted over the
  side. A good place to sit, he knew, since the guard assigned to this post
  often took leisurely catnaps.</p>
  <p>The three figures moved easily through the night, sprinting from rooftop to
  rooftop like a trio of hummingbirds. They eventually settled on an upper-scale
  inn called The Fox’s Crown, which was brimming with music and merriment from
  the tavern on the first floor.</p>
  <p>Falbagar led Gamor and Deyvon along the apex of the slanted rooftop, but
  suddenly stopped and wheeled about. &quot;Are you sure you can do this?&quot;
  he asked, looking at Deyvon.</p>
  <p>At that, Gamor began to unravel a thin cord and lowered an end down one
  side of the roof. Checking his weight, he silently repelled down one side of
  the steep rooftop.</p>
  <p>&quot;Of course I’m sure,&quot; Deyvon replied. &quot;Haven’t we done
  this dozens of times before?&quot;</p>
  <p>Falbagar spoke with concern in his voice, &quot;Things are going to be a
  bit different tonight. You’re going stay up here and keep a sharp eye out
  for any trouble. Gamor and I are going in.&quot;</p>
  <p>Deyvon’s hands went to his sides. &quot;Why?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Look,&quot; the large man said, &quot;We can see what’s been going
  on lately. You just can’t resist anything pretty that catches your eye.
  Frankly, we’ve been wondering if you haven’t been holding out on us these
  past few nights.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;You’re wrong,&quot; Deyvon said.</p>
  <p>&quot;Am I? You sure you ain’t been sneaking a few extra gems and jewels
  under your belt?&quot;</p>
  <p>From the edge of the roof, Gamor’s hushed voice echoed back, &quot;Shut
  up, both of you!&quot; The stealthy man then dropped headfirst over the side
  to peer into a second-story window.</p>
  <p>Falbagar cocked his head to one side, making an audible snap from his neck
  bones. &quot;Just stay here and when we get back we’ll cut you in for the
  amount we think you’re worth. It’s either that or we cut you from the
  team,&quot; he said as he palmed the hilt of his short sword, a move not
  missed by the half-elf’s keen eyes.</p>
  <p>As Falbagar followed the cord down the steep roof, Gamor popped up again,
  &quot;Hey,&quot; he whispered, &quot;now is our chance.&quot; One after
  another, the two men dropped over the edge of the roof and out of sight.</p>
  <p>Deyvon’s lips tightened and he sat down, furrowing his brow with disdain.
  It seemed cracks had already begun to appear in their uneasy relationship.
  Although Falbagar had taken on the role of leader, he hardly carried any
  weight to give anyone else orders.</p>
  <p>&quot;I’ll show them,&quot; the half-elf whispered to himself, &quot;I
  can sneak in there and bring back the largest haul yet. Falbagar will never
  doubt me again.&quot; His meager confidence began to grow as he placed his
  feet under him and crawled a few steps further along the rooftop. Unraveling
  his own rope, he fastened it to a chimney and carefully slid down the opposite
  side of the damp, shingled roof.</p>
  <p>Lowering himself, Deyvon looked inside the room he had chosen. Private
  quarters, no doubt, possibly one of the more luxurious rooms in the inn.
  Darkness covered it, and from his perspective no one stirred. Off getting
  drunk in the tavern, the thief figured.</p>
  <p>Deyvon reached down and pushed the window slightly. It fell open easily and
  the rogue lowered himself and swung inside. With a flick of his wrist, his
  trusty rope fell free of its binding and came down neatly for Deyvon to gather
  up, a trick he taught himself a long time ago.</p>
  <p>Ambient light poured in through the window, casting a solemn blue glow on
  the walls. Deyvon could see a finely carved table, a tall cabinet, and a
  four-poster bed with lush silk blankets all crying out for his attention.
  Sensing no one else in the room, he quickly set to work. He started at the
  cabinet, but found no clothes hanging within. Puzzled, he searched the drawers
  in the table. Again nothing.</p>
  <p>Great, he thought. Nobody home.</p>
  <p>The jiggling of a key searching for a lock came from the room’s door,
  alerting the half-elf.</p>
  <p>Light invaded from the hallway as a heavyset man harshly thrust the door
  open and lumbered in. Finding the room empty, he slammed the door behind him
  and without so much stopping to remove his cloak, flopped down onto the bed
  like a beached whale and passed out under the effects of too much ale.</p>
  <p>Beneath the bed, Deyvon winced as the immense weight of the man pressed the
  mattresses down hard on top of him. For a moment, he thought the oaken frame
  would crack and give way, squashing him flat. He soon realized, however, that
  his life might be spared after all. The bed eased up, and before long a sound
  halfway between a gurgle and a snore roared from the fat man’s face.</p>
  <p>Deyvon grabbed one of the bed’s legs and rotated out to peek about but
  still remain hidden. From up above, the man’s cherubic face, masked by thick
  red and gray whiskers, slept soundly, unaware of the world passing by.</p>
  <p>The man’s arm dangled limply over the side, offering Deyvon his first
  prize of the night. Attached to a golden chain hung perhaps the most gorgeous
  ruby the half-elf had ever seen. Even in the dark of the room it shone with
  myriad sparkles that captivated him. Reaching up, Deyvon gingerly took hold of
  the chain and slipped it off the man’s thick fingers. Cut like a flat,
  diamond shape, the gem fit neatly into the thief’s palm.</p>
  <p>So captivated by the stone was Deyvon that he almost failed to notice the
  door open again, much slower this time. A pair of feet showed themselves,
  stopping at the entrance as whomever it was looked in, and then quietly
  stepped inward. A second pair of feet followed closely behind.</p>
  <p>The half-elf’s heart beat a little faster when he recognized the boots
  and realized that Falbagar and Gamor had just entered the room, hoping to
  steal what they could. He smirked to himself, knowing he had already taken
  what they would most likely kill to find.</p>
  <p>To kill, Deyvon realized. He remembered Falbagar’s words back on the
  roof, and what trouble his current situation had in store. Falbagar accused
  him of keeping hidden loot for himself. Falbagar had been wrong until now. If
  they found him here, Deyvon knew his career, and life, as a rogue would be
  over.</p>
  <p>Keeping his eyes on the feet, he watched as they skulked about the room,
  looking for something to steal. As Falbagar noiselessly moved around the bed
  to ransack the cabinet near the window, Gamor stepped next to a short trunk by
  the door.</p>
  <p>It would only be a matter of seconds before one of them checked the bed.
  Rolling to his back, Deyvon planted his hands between the wooden slats under
  the bed and pushed up on the bulging mattress.</p>
  <p>Up above, the man turned as he felt an unwelcome intrusion violating his
  slumber. He slowly sat upright and rubbed his bloodshot eyes. When he lowered
  his hands he found Falbagar standing over him with a mean grimace etched in
  his face.</p>
  <p>Startled, the man the man cried, &quot;Thief!&quot; at the top of his
  lungs. Falbagar instantly pounced on him with knife drawn. They tussled for a
  moment, each grasping the other man’s wrists to wrestle control of the
  weapon.</p>
  <p>As the mattress creaked and bounced above Deyvon’s head, several of the
  wooden slats began to crack.</p>
  <p>Time to move, he thought.</p>
  <p>Fortunately, Gamor dashed to the window, allowing Deyvon the opportunity to
  escape to the door. As he rolled out, the bed frame crumbled and crashed
  heavily to the floor.</p>
  <p>A spark of light flashed by as the half-elf skidded out into the hallway.
  Running on instincts he ducked, allowing the oncoming sword to miss his neck
  and embed itself into the doorjamb where he once stood.</p>
  <p>The sword’s wielder, a large muscular man dressed in sleeping attire, did
  not appreciate petty rogues breaking in and causing a ruckus, particularly a
  measly half-elf. Deyvon could see the prejudice common throughout the city
  focused intensely in this man’s eyes.</p>
  <p>Deyvon scrambled to his feet just as the swordsman wedged his weapon free
  from the large notch it had created. He tumbled down the hall with the large
  man at his heels and a swinging sword at his back.</p>
  <p>As the chase approached the switchback stairwell leading down to the first
  floor of the inn, Deyvon faked to one side, then reversed and quickly leapt
  over the banister. The man chopped down, narrowly missing the half-elf and
  putting a deep dent into the wood.</p>
  <p>Without slowing his momentum, the man pulled his weapon free and proceeded
  in a huff down the stairs just as Deyvon crawled back up into the hallway
  again. His fingers screamed in pain from the experience of hanging by them,
  but the fake out seemed to have worked.</p>
  <p>Just ahead, he saw the glimmer of the ruby he’d stolen lying alone in the
  hallway. Must have dropped it getting away, he figured. As speedily as his
  short legs would carry him, he dashed to it and reached down, grasping it with
  thin fingers.</p>
  <p>Suddenly, a heavy foot stepped on his hand, crushing it to the floor.
  Deyvon looked up and saw Gamor grinning smugly down at him. &quot;Well, well,
  what do we have here? It seems you just couldn’t resist, could you?&quot;</p>
  <p>Deyvon only stared back, unable to think of anything to say. He didn’t
  have to, though, for at the end of the hall, the swordsman appeared at the top
  of the stairs, this time with a handful of city guardsmen in tow.</p>
  <p>&quot;That’s them!&quot; he growled.</p>
  <p>The thieves exchanged glances and, with a harsh yank, Deyvon pulled his
  hand free. With a flip he stood and bolted into the first open door he found,
  attempting to slam it shut behind him.</p>
  <p>Gamor’s boot stopped the closing, and the human rogue entered in behind
  the half-elf. &quot;Give it to me,&quot; he demanded.</p>
  <p>Deyvon backed up. &quot;What?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;That gem!&quot; Gamor roared as he locked the door behind him.
  &quot;Hand it over and I won’t cut your throat.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;We have to get out of here,&quot; Deyvon reasoned.</p>
  <p>&quot;Don’t worry,&quot; came the quick response, &quot;one of us
  will.&quot;</p>
  <p>As the pounding of heavy shoulders butted against the door, Gamor withdrew
  his sword and came at Deyvon. The smaller half-elf backed away until he could
  go no farther, his back planted against the room’s open windowsill.</p>
  <p>In desperation, Deyvon grabbed for his own dagger, but an expert slash from
  his opponent cut the weapon’s sheath and it dropped to the floor. Before he
  knew what happened, he found Gamor’s blade thrust deep into his left
  shoulder. His eyes shut and mouth fell agape as he bore the pain.</p>
  <p>&quot;The gem!&quot; Gamor demanded again, his hot breath suffocating the
  half-elf.</p>
  <p>Behind him, the door burst open and the room began to flood with guardsmen.
  Gamor turned his head to see, which was the only distraction Deyvon needed.
  With his right hand he snatched a length of rope from his belt hook and
  punched Gamor square in the jaw, driving him back a step. He then flipped
  backward out the window while simultaneously tossing the lasso end of the rope
  over Gamor’s head.</p>
  <p>He fell through the night, but only for a split-second as the rope pulled
  taut around its anchor.</p>
  <p>In the room, the guardmen watched as the rogue that stood before them
  roughly fell back against the window, clutching his neck in desperation. They
  descended upon him.</p>
  <p>Gamor futilely struck out several times in defense but became lost in a sea
  of kicks and cudgels.</p>
  <p>Outside, the rope provided only a minimal break in Deyvon’s fall. Hugging
  the line as tightly as his one good arm would allow, he awkwardly swung inward
  and crashed through a large stained glass window, dropping unceremoniously to
  the floor.</p>
  <p>He sat up and winced at the pieces of glass that had stuck to the exposed
  portions of his light tan-colored skin. Clutching his shoulder, he looked up
  and found himself facing a room full of standing people, some with a look of
  shock, and some with a look of anger. He had crashed into the tavern room of
  The Fox’s Crown.</p>
  <p>Another contingent of guardsmen furiously began to push their way through
  the crowd of people. Recognizing the danger, Deyvon lurched to his feet. As he
  turned he saw the bartender, a short man with a thick mustache, staring at him
  and the broken window. &quot;Sorry,&quot; he said smugly. He then dove back
  out the window, taking care to keep his shoulder wound free from further harm.</p>
  <p>He dashed into the cobblestone street, leaving his dangling rope behind,
  and ducked down a side alleyway.</p>
  <p>The guardsmen, however, weren’t fooled. They bolted out the front door
  and followed in pursuit. Rounding the corner to the next street, they
  hurriedly gave chase just as a small hay wagon drawn by two horses passed them
  in the opposite direction.</p>
  <p>From the back, Deyvon watched the guards go as he buried himself deeper
  under the cold straw.</p>
  <p>From his wrist hung the prize of his efforts, the glittering red ruby he
  had lifted from the fat man back at the inn. He twirled it a few times with
  his good hand, admiring the high quality cuts in the stone. He’d lost his
  weapon and his rope during the escapade, but the price this ruby could fetch
  would more than easily make up for it. Quickly he tucked it away as the wagon
  bounced uneasily down the road, the driver unaware of his new passenger.</p>
  <p>Across the street on a nearby rooftop, Falbagar wiped a trickle of blood
  away from his chin as he watched Deyvon’s wagon roll toward the city gates.
  He wouldn’t soon forget the damned half-elf and swore vengeance.
  Unfortunately with the guardsmen on alert in the area, he didn’t have the
  time to stop and plan revenge. Yet.</p>
