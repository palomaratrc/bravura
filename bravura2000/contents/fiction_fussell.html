  <p>And Into the Lions Den</p>
  <font FACE="Calisto MT">
  <p>It</font> wasn’t dark ……. necessarily; more auburn than anything,
  With fragmented blotches of cerulean paste being exposed between voids in the
  stocky, molasses cloud of red/ebony pulp smoke.</p>
  <p>Teetering out of the giant pipes like some phantasmagoric freight train.</p>
  <p>The old mill still huffing along after all these years; erected in the
  heart of the depression, however in hell many years ago it was when this
  monstrous architecture of pipes and brick spit out its first inexorable clouds
  into the then cobalt air. And my how that dark-brick phoenix of a structure
  has out lived the best of them. An old, dead, long forgotten man stirs in his
  grave: The years laid-waste there, working through immoral conditions in
  bitter desperation. Swarthy, Untamed and boasting small echoes of whom have it
  the worst.</p>
  <p>Still to this day do they stand, sulking in the lot, over-worked and
  stripped of their prime (innate sense of duty picked clean by the buzzards of
  inhuman task.) You can see them blinking their eye whites from under the black
  feculent mask of soot and sod that they all share in displaying, so all
  on-lookers can gawk and unintentionally be thankful for what they have. It is
  as proof, not of their dedication, but of their madness that they stand during
  their ten-minute break, only to go back and work for eight hours straight
  without the plausibility of an intermission. More likely, it is a fusion of
  madness and pride that they stand; I suppose, not letting the bloated
  proprietors win the upper hand, over a battle that has already been decreed.</p>
  <p>Standing out by the coal in the rail-yard………..by the trash, legions
  of them, great armies of them; looking down at the barbaric ground littered
  with dirt , debris and blood-unshorn, then back at the factory still pumping
  out that ungodly smoke, with the spring insects lapping at the mouth of the
  visceral pipes. They stand, in the shadows of the bohemian trash heap….
  Silent, or occasionally kicking a rock in disapproval.</p>
  <p>The inevitable whistle rings; to which they flick their cigarettes in an
  almost precise sequence, acknowledging of what intercourse lies in the
  waiting, then settle back into the charted future of routine. Marching back to
  their posts with heads held high like soldiers proud to die for their country,
  …but less eager.</p>
  <p>These imperious scales have to be shed before entering the layman’s
  industrial pantheon; a common law among these mal-kinsman. Supposing you were
  an omnipotent, all-seeing deus-ex-machina, you would witness a grave testament
  to the decomposition of a man: From when the whistle blows to when they reach
  the clock-in wheel, they are different men, they have shed layers and layers
  of reason, self-worth and have regressed back to a more fitting stature in
  their animalistic nature, the role of bestial survival. A kind of man that
  would stone you for taking pity, but crucify you for not……. Ungoverned,
  cocky, tarnished, savage,……..Godless.</p>
  <p>Or at least that’s how it all appeared to Mr. Orson P. Wright ; so
  youthful and brimming with contempt, starring cock-eyed out at the mass of
  workers covered in black. Once again overanalyzing the helix in which he was
  the only focal point, all else negated as side-thought. Yet it is to be
  expected of a young scholar, fountaining with educated anger and morbid
  ambition. Finding the fiction of thought to be a far more competent cannon,
  than that of the lurid real worlds. And there was Orson hunched behind an old
  run down chain-link fence, just at the edge of the workers domain. In the
  reflection of the giant cloud that emphasized his gaunt and pallid features,
  with his skintight Grey suit bound to his body so candidly, as enigmatic
  panoply. His Second-Hand Store briefcase swaying artlessly in his emaciated
  right hand, as he peered out over the trash and into the valley of these
  over-worked lions, who didn’t give Orson even the slightest glance of an
  acknowledgment; Which might of been expected, to someone with greater
  rational. Quite obviously to these dwarfed giants Orson P.Wright was nothing
  but a mere microcosm of the millions of spectators ignored in the years gone
  down with the mill. He was nothing extra-ordinary that they would go out of
  their way to stop their war and glance over. Which bothered Orson immensely,
  tacking another group to the long list of people who would eventually be sorry
  for not recognizing the gift he possessed at first meeting. And how (if ever
  seeing them again) he would secretly be touting a vengeful message of
  &quot;see what you’ve missed out on&quot; and then go about his way, smug as
  a spoiled child.</p>
  <p>He scratched/pulled at his collar and adjusted his pant leg, staunch and
  tawdry, in his awkward suit that was sewn to body in pitiful servitude. His
  thoughts beseeched back to why in fact he <i>was</i> here, casting unanswered
  looks to the lions of task and feeling under-gunned in all the motion afoot.
  He motioned his head up to the concrete monstrosity next door, with its
  lugubrious sign occasionally quaking in the infectious breeze, yielding some
  rusted letters spelling out:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><u>THE HARRISBURG SYNDICATE</u></p>
  <p align="center"><u>Kill Devil Hills, NC.</p>
  </u>
  <p>And then something below it that was vined over in rust. A building that
  would hopefully enclose him (at least for awhile anyway) with title of job.</p>
  <p>It looked almost peaceful from the outside and compared to the battle next
  door, it was. With its tepid windows and three average industrial stories
  perceptibly vacant to the novice’s eye…The pulp mill began to sputter a
  little and then belted out a stentorian cacophony – shattering any thought
  that might be radiating in Orsons pensive mind. Amusedly only startling him,
  for the lions kept at unflinching posts carrying out their battle, and the
  cows across the separation of street mooed and swished their tails uncaringly.
  The industrial farmers in denim-overalls don’t miss a beat trudging at the
  maternal utter to obey Americas coveting cry of Supply Vs Demand.</p>
  <p>As Orsons anxiety mushroomed, in accordance with the in-between time
  slipping away. Moving faster than his motivation, his hands began sweating,
  shaking, mutating into independent bodies in motion. All from a familiar
  lacking of a certain intake that would, under these circumstances hammer out
  the kinks and tremors in his mania. Indeed this what not the time, but his
  body was in forlorn need. His hands shaking more violently as they moved from
  beyond his deepest control (A motor skill ransacked by the onslaught of
  shameful substance usage and irrational paranoia) as impulsive as they had
  came, they left, and imbedded another thorn of fear into Orsons baobab-tree
  mind. Could he control them when the time came for the interview? Would the
  interviewer smell the liquor on his breath, if he were to remedy the situation
  right here and now? He weighed the options, pretending to be giving them all
  equal, un-biased chances. When in reality he knew what exactly what he would
  do. It would have been quite obvious if you were living in the realm of an
  addiction. Where the circumspection of ones health is a tactless adversary in
  contrast to the acclamation of ones habits, …to which Orson is a flesh and
  bone showcase. Furthering that this was not the time for Orson to be concerned
  with his health and general well being; that wouldn’t tax his neurotic
  paranoia until late in the night, dry of ideas, letting out tumultuous sighs
  and furnishing his muse with cognition’s of death and disease. No, this was
  not the time for that fervored vice to take hold. He always was a great
  student, best of all to the cockatrice inside him. She schooled him well on
  the topic of<i> abscess.</p>
  </i>
  <p>The time was at hand – to act…or…to refrain. Obeying readily, he
  hoisted his prudent briefcase on top of one of the hampered wood-posts that
  barely held the fallen chain-link from the ground, by insufficient means of
  bent and corroded nails. He shuffled his hooks inside his insipid briefcase
  that quaintly held his four recommendations from his professors at college, a
  nearly empty pack of cigarettes bought earlier that morning, a book of matches
  taken from some unremembered night on the town, with himself. And the object
  in mind; an ordinary bottle hiding in the depths of the briefcase
  (purposefully hidden…in unreasonable fear that someone might find it)
  delicately wrapped in a frayed, white dishtowel. He surveyed the landscape in
  search of someone surveying back. With no visible eyes upon him, he wrapped
  his tentacles round’ the solitary bottle, lifted his coat up over his head,
  and acted as he had learned. It felt as if a piece of himself was rekindled
  when that warm liquid hit its mark in the central nervous system…As if the
  barriers had come down, and was now ready to return to thinking prolifically.
  He surveyed the landscape again, just to make sure that he was still an unmade
  man, and he was. He stuffed the bottle back into his briefcase, obtaining his
  other addiction…and the fire to light it.</p>
  <p>With conventional plumes of smoke ascending from Orsons liquored orifice,
  he dumped the now futile match into the rubble at his feet. Stamping his foot
  over it once – just for amusement. In process the wood-post that his
  unaccompanied luggage rested on gave in at the base and sent the contents of
  his briefcase to ground in a small poof of dust. Some of the lions were close
  enough to catch wind of this little melodrama; now quick to the guns of
  acknowledgment, for the sole reason of being able to, simply put: feel
  authority over someone, and then punctuate that to the <i>n</i>th degree. In
  turn they gave little sardonic cheers and demoralizing snickers as Orson
  scrambled in the dirt for his possessions, and most importantly his cherished
  bottle. Clumsily stuffing the contents back into his briefcase and swiping the
  dirt away from its fake black leather.</p>
  <p>His temper ruffled, he rifled through a battery of idiosyncratic put-downs
  and parables, not finding any to his liking he looked away, then glanced down
  at his wrist; only to appear purposeful, never actually looking at the
  time...yet, how could he? He has no watch.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><u>2</u></p>
  <p align="center">The Greased Wheel</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Orson Phillipe Wright, as he is known to the seven degrees of people that
  connect him to the world that he doesn’t know at all. Quick-windedly sped
  through his Idea of how the discourse of questions might unravel:</p>
  <p>&quot; Mighty fine to meet your acquaintance sir, Indeed…oh yes, yes, yes
  found the place with no considerable problem, well,…..Uh-huh, right, yes
  sir, well I thank you for your complements sir…. Wow, really sir…well I‘ve
  never thought of myself as a…&quot;</p>
  <p>But this was wasn’t the first time that Orson had rehearsed this
  monologue. He had obsessed with its exact details of when and why he should
  say what and presumptuously just what the questions might be. For weeks now,
  analyzing every detail of the fictitious future like some modern day drunken
  Nostradamus, with only his own future in mind.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes, well the reason I believe I could be a very strong asset to this
  fine company is…&quot;</p>
  <p>his confidence in his answers now seemed to wane off into the great
  graveyard of his forgotten merit. But it was only the night before last, that
  he assured himself over and over that they were the most professional and
  intellectual dissertation answers possible. He delved further into his
  recanted thoughts,</p>
  <p>&quot; That’ll never do! Maybe if I…ah, the hell with it, ….fuck
  those animals, they only want productivity and wouldn’t know creativity if
  it were crawling up their swinish ass!&quot;.</p>
  <p>But this wasn’t said in full poignancy; Orson now feeling a little more
  testable and lighter in the feet, he let out a small laugh to himself about
  his immature syntax. Abruptly looking around to see if anyone might have taken
  note of his unnoticeable display…then laughed again out of odd
  juxtaposition.</p>
  <p>For the moment it seemed that Orsons mental beasts where on the decline,
  and slightly muted inside the shell of his inebriated synapses. The foolproof
  union to a laded state where he could acknowledge his progress, be sustained
  with his accomplishments and generally take on the world with a more vivacious
  disposition. Superior to that of the frantic, over-pessimistic state of his
  sobriety, which lately, (out of the collegiate mind occupier and all) has
  become less and less. It wasn’t always like this; there was a point when
  Orson had the strength to not do the willing act that he so loved. He would go
  weekdays in a frenzy of deadlines to serve the greater, higher education boot
  camp, then have the stereotypical collegiate weekend of
  &quot;well-deserved&quot; vomiting and &quot;blacking-out&quot;-which is slang
  for having a <i>few</i> too many. But now, along the crowded lines of present
  day; his voice of reason struck in by the denomination of his now
  uncontrollable state; Including the detriment of his introverted boredom and
  personal mis-attempts that set their seed deep into the hopes of Orson and
  assailed his thoughts with spells of futility. His greatest fear morphing from
  – unrecognization of his talents - to –actually having to stop how is, to
  get what he wants. Average life was as good as being dead to Orsons all or
  nothing processes…and this was not taken lightly. He’d find himself
  progressively blocking all out, one by one, away from his mirage if they didn’t
  support his vermicular lifestyle in some irrational way; his friends, his
  family, even his lust conciliators – their relationship being forfeited to
  the iron fortress of his habits. He could be so cold and thoughtless when it
  came to relationships with his human surrounds.</p>
  <p>It was no more than a few months ago, in which he had shunned these people
  from his physical existence, like the self-defeating recluse he is. Now truly
  alone, sitting in his armless rocking chair from all of dawn to dark, then
  vice versa. Even though he could not tell what time of day it might be, with
  big black sheets nailed to the windows blocking out the crisis of productive
  daylight. Creating himself an ambiance equal to night, trying monotonously to
  match his vain and frivolous emotions. Tainting himself with oral injection
  after injection of his own liquid hope. Under the darkness of his room, his
  face still manifesting a clearly visible scarlet hue, as he sat, slowly
  rocking back and forth in that decrepit grandmother chair; babbling to himself
  different exerts of feral prose and almost undecipherable dialogues. Pieces
  that he believed would be part of some zenith of all books that he indeed
  would write someday…. someday when he was different, or in different
  surrounds; but for now raving about it and mentally chiseling out the most
  minute details of all the characters that would be in his modern day bible was
  as far as it could be recognized in solidity.</p>
  <p>&quot;Chapter six……no seven,… the mason emerges from…..no,….the
  woodworker emerges from the forest… reaches the awed group huddled at the
  edge of the mount …worshipping...at the prophets callused feet, as he stood
  dictating his truth…..with arms out shadowing them from the sun; their
  attention following every enunciation the prophet makes;…..the woodworker,…who
  is angered by the prophets words, interrupts – ‘nay! God is not in the
  unattainable heavens!, he is in the woods with axe and mule’…subplot: the
  woodworker is stoned for hieracy…..yes, ha, phum,…..where was I?,….oh..wait…
  no..oh yes, chapter ten opening paragraph ---</p>
  <p>‘ whatcha’ say?’-</p>
  <p>‘ I said it’s like goats in a cage….’</p>
  <p>‘ Whut’?’</p>
  <p>‘ You know, either lockin’ horns or typically fucking each other ’</p>
  <p>‘ Is dat’ it? ’</p>
  <p>‘ Is there more to say? ’</p>
  <p>Chapter two, verse twelve…..no,no,no much too soon,…. chapter four?…..yes?…no,
  it will conflict with third paragraph argument over a rotten loaf of bread
  with the number two slow, gluttonous, over-ripe comically foolish fat man, nah……..too
  crass…no that will….yes,yes chapter five, verse twenty six will work
  perfectly!……ha,ha,ha…..wait….what?…what was I saying?….&quot;</p>
  <p>his talk was about as solid as the drink he loved,….more than writing,
  which he was never any good at anyway. &quot;Writer&quot; had become the title
  he believed would best suit him, and that people would automatically think
  that there is more to him, if he were to call himself it. Never did he really
  love writing or post great abilities in the subject; yes, he was always more
  interested in the way people would rank and envy him due to that self-avowed
  title.</p>
  <p>It was his mother who said it best (drunk out of her mind) &quot; that boy
  of mine sure as…. (a cough)…sure as hell-fire ain’t no writer,…but
  there ain’t nothing out there that’ll get him to stop &quot;. He cringed
  as he thought of his mothers slurring dictation…his memory stretching back
  years ago when he had eavesdropped on one of her alcohol-fueled tantrums. She
  (fading in and out of consciousness) was propped against the kitchen wall
  pressing the phone betwixt her ear and the wallpaper, for she was too tired to
  stand unassisted and too drunk to lie down. Full of contempt and displeasure
  as she commented on how her son was &quot;makin’ the wrong decisions, for
  his self &quot; and most hurtfully &quot;ain’t no writer&quot;; those words
  seemed to haunt Orson and played in an incessant loop in his mind. And it was
  just the night before when he, engulfed in a familiar wave of pathos,…. -
  &quot;Not a writer!? - I’ll show her, all show them all!,…and then we’ll
  see whose who!&quot;- he spat into the subdued hem of his alien apartment,…..As
  he forged his professors names on the neatly fabricated recommendations.<font SIZE="2"></p>
