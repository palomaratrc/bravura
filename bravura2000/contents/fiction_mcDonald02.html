  <p>Rain pattered on the window outside. The gray night penetrated the house,
  despite the lamp's futile attempt to keep it out. Cold seeped in through the
  windows, crawling closer and closer to the middle of the room, waging a silent
  war with the heat from inside. In the center of the blue carpeted room, seated
  cross legged on the floor, was a young girl. She ignored the silent war around
  her, as she did the old wooden coffee table and threadbare couch that stood
  sentinel on either side of her. Thunder crashed, and only the most careful of
  observers would have seen the tightening of her shoulders. Her muscles relaxed
  again quickly, the tightness melting away as though it had never been.
  Upstairs something broke and a chorus of laughter filtered down through the
  ceiling to drift indolently around the girl's hunched form.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>She ignored the laughter as she ignored everything else, for all intents
  and purposes concentrating on her game of solitaire. If one had asked her if
  she liked it, she would have told them heatedly what a wretched game it truly
  was. But no one asked, and so she played.</p>
  <p>Black jack on the red queen.</p>
  <p>Red five on the black six.</p>
  <p>Lightning crashed again, brightening the room for only a moment. The lamp
  flickered, and went out. Several people above screamed, not truly scared, but
  startled. She sat in the blackness for a moment, letting her violet eyes
  become accustomed to the dark.</p>
  <p>Black six on the red seven. Flip the top card. Ace of spades.</p>
  <p>Set the killing card aside, put the two of spades on top. Other black two
  on the red three. Flip the card. King of spades. Black four on the red five.
  The whole set on the king of spades.</p>
  <p>Flip the card. Black and white. White and red. Ace of diamonds. Put it at
  the top, put the two of diamonds on it and the three of diamonds on that.</p>
  <p>Flip the card.</p>
  <p>Laughter. The lights came back on, and there was a screech of delight. The
  floor thumped above her head, and she blinked as her eyes re-adjusted
  themselves to the light.</p>
  <p>Black jack on the red queen.</p>
  <p>Above, a thump. Music played, filtered through the floor-ceiling. A clock
  on the opposite wall of the room blinked 12:00 in morbid red light. A glance
  at her watch told the girl it was actually closer to ten. Long before her
  bedtime.</p>
  <p>Laughter above. Three of spades on the two of spades.</p>
  <p>More laughter. Glasses clinked. People talked. Someone was dancing.</p>
  <p>Solitaire.</p>
  <p>Black four on the red five. Flip the card. King of clubs. Everything fell
  into order, and she methodically piled the cards into their right places.</p>
  <p>Game over.</p>
  <p>She won.</p>
  <p>Again.</p>
  <p>Stupid game.</p>
  <p>Above, light, sound, laughter, dancing.</p>
  <p>She glared at the ceiling overhead, refusing to admit that she wished she
  were up there, too. &quot;You're too young.&quot; Right. She knew that the
  Andersons had brought their two boys, and the Castiles had brought their girl.</p>
  <p>She smiled slightly as she unfolded long legs, like a spider coming out of
  its web. Black stretch pants slid across pale skin as she walked silently up
  the stairs, tucking black hair behind her white ear. Her sweater dropped
  softly around her thighs. Something her mother had bought because it was
  'appropriate.'</p>
  <p>She hesitated as she reached the basement door.</p>
  <p>Lightning flashed again and the lights went out once more. She opened the
  door, walking into the now dark room with its white carpeting and leather
  furniture. People milled about, some of the women pretending to be afraid of
  the dark.</p>
  <p>Her eyes hadn't yet adjusted to the blackness, and she bumped into someone
  before backing quickly away, looking up to see who it was. Ben reached out
  with one hand to steady her, the other full with a tray of champagne glasses.
  His blue eyes were friendly as he recognized her and smiled.</p>
  <p>&quot;Topaz, be careful,&quot; he whispered, releasing her gently.
  &quot;Aren't you supposed to be in bed?&quot;</p>
  <p>She shook her head slowly, watching him. &quot;Not for another hour, at
  least. It's only ten.&quot;</p>
  <p>Ben smiled at her uncertainly, then nodded. &quot;Your mother's over by the
  door.&quot;</p>
  <p>Topaz glanced down that way, at the other end of the room, and spotted her
  mother, elegant in her sparkling blue evening dress, her blonde hair swept up
  into an intricate-looking design. She laughed, holding a flute of merrily
  bubbling champagne. Like the champagne, she was bubbly and pretty to watch,
  sweet going down, with enough snap to make you know she was there, and all
  very sophisticated. <i>And like the champagne,</i> Topaz thought wryly, <i>if
  you have too much it'll make you sick.</i></p>
  <p>&quot;Thanks, Ben,&quot; Topaz whispered, then turned and went the other
  way. She wandered through the throngs of people, listening to the sounds as
  she shuffled carefully through the crowded room, ducking as much notice as
  possible. Eventually, she made it to the kitchen, where she stopped to get
  something to eat. She snuck food from one of the platters the cooks were
  working on, then hurried out before any of them threw a fit. Topaz stopped
  suddenly, glancing up as she saw shiny black shoes standing before her. Two
  boys slouched there, wearing stiff tuxedoes and looked bored.</p>
  <p>&quot;Hey, Topaz, that you?&quot; one of them asked, stopping her.</p>
  <p>Topaz sighed and looked up through her black hair at the blond teen.
  Lightning crashed in fury outside, tearing through the sky.</p>
  <p>&quot;I thought your mom said you were at a boarding school,&quot; Andrew
  said, frowning.</p>
  <p>&quot;I am. I'm just an illusion,&quot; she answered with a fake smile.</p>
  <p>The boys laughed, and blocked her from going anywhere. Apparently they were
  bored with the adult conversation, and talking to ten-year-old Topaz was
  better than nothing. The three of them had met only once before, when Topaz
  had been five and her face had been bandaged from the fire. The boys had
  written a few letters back and forth to her, it was good public relations for
  their father if they wrote letters to poor, burned Topaz, but they hadn't seen
  each other again. Topaz was gone whenever her parents threw parties.</p>
  <p>&quot;You're an awfully good illusion,&quot; Jerry said, grinning.</p>
  <p>Topaz hadn't lifted her head once, her hair falling over half of her face.
  She just smiled and went to move away, only to be blocked again by Andrew. She
  glared up at him.</p>
  <p>&quot;You're awfully pale. You sick?&quot;</p>
  <p><i>No, dimweed, I'm just pale,</i> she thought snidely before pasting a
  smile on her face. &quot;Yeah. Let me by.&quot;</p>
  <p>The boys sighed and moved aside, and Topaz started to pass. She stopped
  dead when she saw her mother coming her way, and turned quickly back to the
  boys so that she was facing away from the woman. &quot;You guys want to go
  play dominoes?&quot; she asked, keeping track of where her mother had stopped
  by a group of people.</p>
  <p>&quot;Sure,&quot; Jerry said, the younger of the two and more easily bored.</p>
  <p>They hurried through the kitchen and into a hallway, down that and into a
  playroom. &quot;They're in here,&quot; Topaz said over her shoulder.</p>
  <p>&quot;What is that on your eye?&quot; Andrew asked in surprise. He
  advanced, his own pale eyes wide with surprise.</p>
  <p>Topaz was faster than she looked, and twisted away smoothly. &quot;It's
  nothing,&quot; she said, slipping over to a cabinet to get the dominoes.</p>
  <p>But both Jerry and Andrew were curious now, and they cornered her against
  the wood paneling.</p>
  <p>&quot;Give it up, Paz,&quot; Andrew said seriously. &quot;What is
  that?&quot;</p>
  <p>Topaz sighed and turned around, moving her hair away from her face.</p>
  <p>The two boys looked at her in silence for a minute, then Andrew bit his
  lip. &quot;That's from the fire?&quot;</p>
  <p>Jerry piped up with, &quot;Your skin's all white and shiny!&quot;</p>
  <p>Topaz glared at Jerry, who was oblivious.</p>
  <p>&quot;That is so cool,&quot; Jerry continued, only to be ribbed by his
  brother.</p>
  <p>Andrew was about to say something when the door opened and Topaz's mother
  glided in, stopping at the sight of them.</p>
  <p>&quot;Topaz!&quot; she said, as shock and anger warred on her face. In a
  sudden usurpation, charm and training won out and Adrienne smiled at the boys
  graciously. &quot;Andrew, Jerry, would you please excuse us? Topaz is
  sick.&quot;</p>
  <p>The two boys muttered apologies and slunk out the door.</p>
  <p>Adrienne watched her daughter for a moment, then turned and left the room,
  closing the door behind her.</p>
  <p>Topaz sat down slowly, her back against the wall. Outside, fire ran through
  the sky, brightening the room and casting eerie shadows.</p>
  <p>The door opened again and Adrienne marched in, followed closely by Grace.
  &quot;Keep her out,&quot; Adrienne snapped to the younger woman, a slim and
  beringed finger pointing imperiously at Topaz. A moment later she'd breezed
  out, the door closing behind her.</p>
  <p>Grace looked down at Topaz, sighing. &quot;You know you were supposed to
  stay downstairs,&quot; she said softly, coming to sit next to the girl.</p>
  <p>&quot;I know,&quot; Topaz muttered. &quot;I just wanted to see the
  party.&quot;</p>
  <p>Grace nodded, smoothing stray locks of Topaz's coal black hair away from
  the girl's face. &quot;I know.&quot;</p>
  <p>Topaz looked up at the woman, whose soft brown hair had been braided down
  her back. &quot;I wish I had skin like yours,&quot; she said, touching the
  tanned woman's cheek softly. Grace captured the fingers and kissed them, then
  held them up against her own hand.</p>
  <p>&quot;But then you would look too much like me,&quot; she answered just as
  quietly.</p>
  <p>&quot;I look like a freak with white, shiny skin,&quot; Topaz returned
  bitterly.</p>
  <p>&quot;It used to be that women tried hard to be as white as they could. It
  was a sign of beauty,&quot; Grace responded.</p>
  <p>Topaz screwed her face up. &quot;I read that. They can keep their
  whiteness. I'd rather be dark.&quot;</p>
  <p>Grace smiled slightly and ran the back of her knuckles over Topaz's
  unscarred cheek. &quot;You're beautiful.&quot;</p>
  <p>Topaz glared at the floor and ran the fingers of her free hand over her
  scars. &quot;Maybe I'll get a tattoo. It'd be cooler than this.&quot;</p>
  <p>Grace laughed, like bells chiming. &quot;Your parents would never let you
  get a tattoo.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Why not? It's not like they let me be seen anyway. They want to lock
  me up like . . . like . . . the Hunchback!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;But who won in the end?&quot; Grace asked softly.</p>
  <p>Topaz scowled. &quot;The Hunchback, sort of. Only wasn't he retarded?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes, and you're very smart. Quasimodo's not a good comparison. What
  about the Beast?&quot;</p>
  <p>Topaz considered, then nodded. &quot;Beauty and the Beast? Yes, he was
  locked away.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;And he was kind, just like you. And in the end he won.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;But he became beautiful,&quot; Topaz muttered, standing up and
  walking to the hanging mirror. &quot;And I won't.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;We just need some make-up on you,&quot; Grace said, coming to stand
  beside her. She opened her small purse, pulling out powder. &quot;I don't have
  much, but it'll do for now.&quot; She turned Topaz toward her, then slowly
  started applying the powder to the girl's face. It didn't do much other than
  add a hint of color over the white burn scars, but Topaz was happy with the
  results when she looked in the mirror.</p>
  <p>&quot;Can I have blush too?&quot; Topaz asked slyly, watching her keeper
  out of the corner of her large eyes.</p>
  <p>Grace smiled and pulled it out of her purse.</p>
  <p>&quot;Now,&quot; Grace said after they were done playing with the make-up,
  &quot;shall we go to bed?&quot;</p>
  <p>Topaz sighed and let herself be led out of the playroom. &quot;I wish you
  were my mom,&quot; she said as she crawled into bed, pulling the blankets up
  to her chin while Grace sat on the edge of the mattress.</p>
  <p>&quot;I wish you were my daughter,&quot; Grace answered.</p>
  <p>&quot;You wouldn't tell me I couldn't come to parties because you were
  ashamed of the way I looked, would you?&quot; Topaz asked.</p>
  <p>Grace smoothed the girl's hair away from her face. &quot;Your mother's not
  ashamed of you.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Then I suppose she doesn't let me go anywhere for my health,&quot;
  Topaz answered sarcastically, rolling her eyes in an exaggerated motion.</p>
  <p>There was silence for a moment, and then, &quot;Go to sleep,&quot; Grace
  said, not answering Topaz's remark, which, in Topaz's opinion, was answer
  enough. &quot;In the morning I'll show you the new book I bought. It's long,
  and it'll take you at least a week to read.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Does it have fighting?&quot; Topaz asked wistfully, her mind diverted
  from its destructive course.</p>
  <p>&quot;Swordfighting,&quot; Grace answered, her warm brown eyes sparkling.</p>
  <p>&quot;Horses?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Lots.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;What's it called?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;<u>The Three Musketeers</u>.&quot;</p>
  <p>Topaz thought about that. She smiled. &quot;Sounds good.&quot;</p>
  <p>Grace nodded and kissed the girl's forehead, standing up and leaving the
  room. She closed the door behind her, blocking the intrusive noise of the
  party out. The thunder rumbled contentedly as Topaz drifted toward sleep, rain
  pattering a tune against the window. Almost asleep, Topaz smiled.
  Someday--maybe someday <i>soon</i>--she would be just like one of the heroines
  in her books, and everyone would love her and think she was beautiful. With a
  sigh, Topaz slipped into her dreams.</p>
