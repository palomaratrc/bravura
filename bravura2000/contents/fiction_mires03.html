  <p>Oceanside, Carlsbad, Solana Beach, Del Mar. When I first moved to Southern
  California those names were music to my ears, a siren song of the vague, lush
  promise of life in paradise. Names that sparkled like fool's gold, names that
  glimmered and winked like so many luminous mirages. I moved blindly to this
  corner of the United States and was promptly hypnotized by the gentle sway of
  the palm trees, stunned by the surreal warmth, mesmerized by the comings and
  goings of so many beautiful people. Beautiful people on bicycles, beautiful
  people with surfboards, beautiful people lounging in coffee shops, beautiful
  people in Mercedes and BMWs and Mustang convertibles.</p>
  <p>I somehow fooled myself into believing that by simply being near such
  perfection, I was a part of it, I was one of them. Once I moved in I tanned my
  skin and highlighted my hair, spent my money on clothes and adorned myself
  with an array of glittery silver jewelry.</p>
  <p>But my clothes, my rent, my car, and my leisurely lunches were all a noose
  around my neck, a noose that was slowly, so slowly, beginning to tighten.
  Unable to relinquish the fantasy, unable to live within the meager confines of
  my paltry paycheck, I was forced to turn to a second job, and thus began my
  time with Whitneys, a small but exclusive catering company.</p>
  <p>A strange kind of shame would overcome me when I tied on my white apron and
  carried my silver tray around the lavish homes of Rancho Santa Fe or Del Mar
  or La Jolla, the opulent homes of society princesses, publishing magnates,
  plastic surgeons, and drug company barons. I would run my trembling fingers
  over the spotless grand pianos, the Picassos, the Dalis; I would stand next to
  the swimming pools that overlooked the vast, yawning depth of the Pacific
  Ocean and swoon, near drunk on jealousy and sweet summer air.</p>
  <p>As I moved silently through the magnificent rooms, collecting dirty
  cocktail napkins and empty champagne flutes, I would watch the women in their
  perfectly tailored suits chatter mindlessly to one another, enormous diamonds
  adorning their hands and stylish hair cascading over their impossibly slim
  shoulders. I wanted to talk to them, to show them that I was as well traveled
  and as well educated, show them that I was more than a waitress, more than a
  hired hand. I wanted to move with their easy grace, laugh with their silvery
  voices, and gaze absentmindedly across the room with their gorgeous, jaded
  eyes.</p>
  <p>But those women looked right through me, stopping their vapid conversations
  only long enough to ask for another glass of mineral water or a morsel of
  seared tuna. The bile would rise in my throat at these commands, always
  uttered without so much as a please or a thank-you, always accompanied by a
  dismissive flick of the wrist. I hated myself for envying those women, envying
  them because they could ignore me, because they didn't have to care, because
  to them compassion and empathy were thousand dollar cheques written to one
  charity or another. With every credit card statement that lay unpaid on my
  desk, with every tiny paycheck that I deposited into my ever-dwindling
  account, with every mile that I squeezed out of my old car, I yearned for a
  chance to be just like them. And then one day, it happened.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It was a Sunday morning, and my catering company had asked me to drive to a
  home on Moonridge Avenue in La Jolla to pick up a bag of forgotten linens,
  left from a function they had held the previous week. I rose early to shower
  and dress appropriately, in my second hand Ann Taylor suit and black pumps,
  and I started the long drive from my apartment in Oceanside long before I was
  due to arrive at the house. As I moved south along the Coast Highway the
  sultry summer scenes slid past the movie screen of my car window. The waves
  crashed effortlessly on the pristine beaches, sinewy cyclists pedaled serenely
  along the edge of the roadway, and idle patrons languished in the myriad of
  cafes that litter the hearts of coastal towns.</p>
  <p>As I drove in silence, I felt that familiar tug in my heart, the aching
  desire to be in someone else's place, whether it be a man piloting his Jaguar
  XJS or a woman lazily reading the Sunday <u>Union-Tribune</u> over coffee. I
  drove slowly, savoring these sights, making myself sick with envy, wondering
  why I couldn't be someone else, someone who belonged in a boutique or a Lexus
  or a million dollar home, someone with an easy, perfect life. I wondered
  myself into a blue funk, and soon enough found myself on Moonridge Avenue,
  walking up to an enormous white house and knocking on an enormous white door.</p>
  <p>Slowly the door swung open, and in halting English a small Spanish woman
  asked, &quot;Are you here for Jasmine?&quot;</p>
  <p>I began to explain why I was there, that I was only from the catering
  company, that my only purpose was to collect a bag of soiled linens, but when
  her eyes began to harden, I smiled graciously, took fate by the hand, and
  responded in a strong voice, &quot;Yes, I am.&quot;</p>
  <p>With a curt nod of acceptance she ushered me into the house, &quot;Come in,
  come in!&quot; My heart fluttered and I stepped proudly across the threshold,
  brushing lint from my faded black suit as if it were made from the finest of
  linen. I threw back my shoulders and assumed an air of indifference, an air
  that I had watched so many other women master.</p>
  <p>What had struck me about the exterior of the house was its plain austerity:
  for a moment I had wondered if anyone lived there at all. The interior was not
  much different. Pristine white walls, white tiles in the entrance way, and
  soft white carpeting in what I guessed was the living room where the maid and
  I now stood. The old woman smiled, &quot;Sit, sit!&quot; and disappeared,
  leaving me to consider the path I had just taken. There was still time to back
  out: all I had to do was find the garage, grab the bag of linen, and be on my
  way. Nobody would be the wiser. But then I imagined what I would do
  afterwards. Nothing. The rest of the day stretched before me in a mind-numbing
  string of empty minutes and hours, a void, a vacuum. So I sat gingerly down on
  the edge of the clean white sofa, humming softly to calm my nerves. I had a
  delicious thrill at the thought of meeting Jasmine and seeing either shock or
  acceptance in her eyes. I wondered how far I could take this game.</p>
  <p>Soon the maid returned with a flustered woman, probably in her late 40's,
  with impeccably coifed bleached blonde hair and wearing a well-cut,
  conservative black pantsuit. She reached out to shake my hand with her limp
  grip, and said, in a quivering voice, &quot;Monica, so nice of you to come. We
  were so afraid that you wouldn't be able to make it. I only wish that Jasmine
  were here to see you now.&quot; Tears came to the woman's eyes. My heart
  nearly stopped and suddenly I had the feeling that my playful game had taken a
  shameful twist.</p>
  <p>&quot;She had so few friends, you know, that we worried nobody would come
  to say a final word. I can't tell you how much it means to Greg and me that
  you are here.&quot; She looked at me with shining eyes, a feeble smile playing
  on her lips. &quot;The limousine will be leaving in about fifteen minutes. Can
  I get you anything to drink?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;No thank you, I'm fine.&quot; Final words? I should have revealed my
  identity. Final words?</p>
  <p>&quot;Would you like to see her room?&quot; Mrs. Whoever looked so hopeful
  and so pathetic that I couldn't refuse. I should have revealed my identity
  right then, but I couldn't. I wanted to keep going. I was Monica now, I was a
  guest in this home, and I was a friend of the family. I belonged.</p>
  <p>&quot;I would love to,&quot; I responded, in a lilting, feminine voice that
  I barely recognized, as I reached for the woman's hand and patted it
  reassuringly. She looked relieved.</p>
  <p>&quot;Follow me.&quot;</p>
  <p>We walked towards an imposing wooden staircase, dark polished wood with the
  same soft white carpeting running up to meet the second floor. So far every
  wall that I had seen was the same eerie perfect white, with the occasional
  conservative, nondescript painting hanging in isolation here or there on a
  wall, like cacti in a desert. Mrs. Whoever (I would have to figure out her
  name) glided effortlessly up the stairs like a ghost, chattering to me about
  Jasmine's room and how it hadn't been touched since the &quot;unfortunate
  incident.&quot; My heart began to pound. This lady was leading me to the
  mysterious girl's bedroom like an executioner leading a prisoner to her fate.</p>
  <p>&quot;Here we are,&quot; Mrs. Whoever said proudly of the room. The walls
  were still the same maddening white, with the same soft white carpeting spread
  across the floor, and more depressingly plain décor. Dark wooden furniture, a
  dark green bedspread, and more uninspired art clinging desperately to the
  smooth, white walls. The room, and indeed the whole house, had the antiseptic
  air of a hospital or mental institution. I was beginning to feel a bit mental
  myself. What would Monica say?</p>
  <p>&quot;I love the paintings,&quot; said my unfamiliar voice again. I scanned
  the room for a photograph of Jasmine, but the dresser stood stubbornly, naked
  of any personal effects, and the bedside table was home only to an alarm clock
  and a tube of Chap Stick.</p>
  <p>&quot;She chose them herself. She has such good taste. Oh God, <u>had</u>
  such good taste.&quot; Her voice faltered, and I put my arm around her,
  praying that she wouldn't start to cry. She seemed to appreciate my touch, and
  we stood there together for a moment, her thin shoulders and soft hair pressed
  against me, her Chanel perfume enveloping us both.</p>
  <p>&quot;Maybe we should go downstairs and wait for the limo,&quot; I offered
  hopefully.</p>
  <p>&quot;You're right, dear. Let's go.&quot; She hurried out of the room and I
  followed her back downstairs to the living room. One damn family picture.
  That's all I wanted to see. Did these people live in this house or was it just
  for show? Mrs. Whoever was dabbing her eyes with a Kleenex. Her appearance was
  about as nondescript and perfectly maintained as that of her home. For some
  reason this bothered me. A boring Sunday didn't seem like such a curse after
  all. But the limo arrived just as I was mustering the courage to reveal my
  identity. Then Mr. Whoever walked brusquely into the room.</p>
  <p>&quot;Let's go, Cassandra,&quot; he barked without looking at us, &quot;the
  service is at noon.&quot;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Whoever stepped quickly towards him and gently lay a hand on his arm.
  &quot;Oh Greg, dear, Monica is here.&quot; She smiled weakly at him.</p>
  <p>&quot;Hello Monica. We're so glad that you could make it. Jasmine would be
  pleased.&quot; He spoke as if this were a business arrangement, and I accepted
  his hearty handshake and bit my tongue when his gaze rested a moment too long
  on my bustline. Once inside the limo, Mrs. Whoever - Cassandra - sniffled and
  toyed with her Kleenex while Mr. Whoever - Greg - barked orders on his
  cell-phone. I gazed out of the window and marveled at my stupidity. This was,
  I thought, the height of insensitivity, but I couldn't admit my true identity.
  I nestled back into the leather seat and watched the scenery slide by the
  polished, tinted glass, saying my new name under my breath - MoniCA - with an
  assertive kick at the end.</p>
  <p>We arrived at a small church about 10 minutes away. There weren't many
  mourners, and I was unnerved to see an open casket yawning ominously at the
  end of the aisle. A blue-haired old woman turned to look as we walked towards
  the front of the church, but the handful of other people just sat and stared
  at whatever people stare at when they're trapped in a pew. The organist was
  playing something appropriately melancholy. Cassandra grasped Greg's arm,
  sniveled loudly, and with a weary sigh Greg patted her hand and glanced
  quickly at his watch. He seemed to be thinking about football or lunch, and I
  couldn't help but wonder if he was Jasmine's birth father.</p>
  <p>The three of us sat together in the foremost row; somehow Greg ended up
  between Cassandra and me, and he put one arm around each of us, squeezing my
  shoulder with a beefy hand. I swear he kept sneaking glances at my crotch. I
  crossed my legs away from him and tried to shrug his hand off of my shoulder,
  which only seemed to tighten his grip.</p>
  <p>After what seemed like an eternity, a Priest made his way to the podium.
  The organist laid off the melodrama, and Father Somebody began his tired
  speech about ashes to ashes and how we will all miss Dear Sweet Jasmine.
  Between the canned eulogy and Greg's lecherous grip, I was having a hard time
  mourning my dead friend. I reckoned that Monica wouldn't have stood for such
  manhandling, but just as I leaned forward to disengage myself from the octopus
  by pretending to scratch my ankle, I heard the Priest say, &quot;And now I
  would like to invite the friends and family of Jasmine Crestwell to say a few
  words in her memory.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cassandra leaned over and whispered, &quot;Monica, please go up and say a
  few words. You knew her better than anyone. I just can't bring myself to go up
  there right now. Please.&quot;</p>
  <p>She looked so pathetic, so trusting. Her promiscuous husband moved his paw
  from my shoulder to my leg, licked his dry lips, patted my thigh, and said,
  &quot;Yes Monica, please say a few words.&quot; A siren was sounding in my
  mind: I was being asked to be the last person to speak for the lost life of a
  human being, a human being whom I had never even met! The absurdity of the
  situation floored me - not so much my illicit participation, but the fact that
  even if I weren't here Cassandra would still be sniffling, Greg would still be
  staring off into the distance, and nobody outside of the Crestwell's perfect
  lives would give a damn about the untimely passing of their only daughter.</p>
  <p>I stood up, slightly dizzy, but instead of heading straight to the podium,
  I made my way over to the casket, as if drawn by an invisible rope. I had to
  get at least one good look at the girl in whose memory I was about to speak.</p>
  <p>I took a deep breath and stared down into the casket. I don't know what I
  expected, but with such a fragrant and beautiful name I was shocked to see
  such an awkward and horsy looking girl laying so uncomfortably in the smooth
  satin lining. She was dressed in a pink linen suit, which clashed violently
  with her bright red hair and pale freckled skin. Her large features and fleshy
  limbs unnerved me, and I could imagine this oafish girl lurking in that
  maddeningly perfect house, every smooth white wall and spotless acre of carpet
  an insult to her gawky body and violent coloring. I could see her perfect
  mother watching her bumble through the house, trying not to be disappointed
  that her only child was so cumbersome and displeasing to the eye, and I could
  see her arrogant father watching the same girl and wanting to hurt her for
  being so ugly. I remembered my own father's rage when I brought home bad
  grades or forgot to take out the garbage, how my mother would cry and implore
  him to stop, how they would fight into the small hours of the morning and then
  fall into bed amid the creak of bedsprings and groan of floorboards.</p>
  <p>Staring down at the dead girl, I felt my own childhood flooding back, and I
  reached out and grabbed the side of the casket to steady myself. I continued
  to stare into her expressionless face, wishing that I could talk to her,
  wishing that I knew why she couldn't take it anymore. It's arrogant and
  presumptuous for me to say, but part of me was glad that Jasmine was safely
  resting in that wooden box. Whatever her discomfort in life, whatever her
  mistakes or misgivings, it was all over. She had nothing to worry about
  anymore, and for a moment, for a few minutes, I was actually jealous.</p>
  <p>I don't know how long I stood in front of that yawning casket, but I soon
  realized that I had to say goodbye to this strange girl, as much for me as for
  her. I wondered if things would be different if I had met her a week or two
  sooner, if I or Monica or somebody could have made a difference. But I knew
  that was just sentimentality. I would have looked at her the same way that I
  looked at all the people swarming the streets of Carlsbad and Encinitas and
  Solana Beach and Del Mar. Perfect people living perfect lives, without so much
  as a care in the world. I was so caught up in my own petty jealousy and my own
  insecurity that I would never have been able to see the desperate look of
  loneliness on Jasmine's or anyone else's face. All I could see were the
  flawless facades, the beautiful faces, the glossy exteriors hiding the
  frightened humans within.</p>
  <p>The tiny congregation was getting restless. I was taking too long. I spun
  around, delirious, and announced in a clear, loud voice, &quot;She was the
  best friend that I could ever have hoped for. Loyal to the end and always
  there when I needed her. I can't believe that she's gone. I just can't believe
  it.&quot;</p>
  <p>Cassandra wailed, Greg licked his lips, and the congregation sighed. I
  hated myself right then, hated myself for carelessly intruding into these
  people's lives, for passing judgment like some kind of holier-than-thou
  princess, for wanting to spice up my own dreary life by altering theirs. I
  covered my eyes as if to hide tears of mourning, and slunk back to the pew to
  sit down, ashamed. Cassandra reached over and grasped my hand, and I squeezed
  it hard in response. Greg again had his arms around both of us, and we sat
  there, a triumvirate of awkward grief, clutching one another for solace.</p>
