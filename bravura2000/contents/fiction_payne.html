  <p>By Janelle Payne</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>By all appearances, it was a typical day in the life of Elliott Marsh: a
  good day in the good life of a good man. He’d closed another big deal today,
  a great way to end the week. He pulled his BMW 740il into the middle of his
  two-car garage, noticing as he did that his wife’s car (a sweet little
  Mercedes he’d given her last year for her 39<sup>th</sup> birthday) wasn’t
  in its double-wide stall. He regretted not stopping for flowers to soften the
  blow of springing company on her. Since he hadn’t been able to reach Rachel
  on her cell phone, he hoped she got the message that Andy and Kim were coming
  over for dinner – just a little celebration – around seven o’clock, less
  than an hour from now.</p>
  <p>Neatly laying his suit jacket over the back of a soft leather chair, he
  picked up a remote, hit the &quot;on&quot; button, and jazz music wafted from
  the Bose speakers, filling the house with the smooth sounds of John Pizarelli.
  He opened the sliding French doors and let in the cool early evening breeze.
  It was that time of year when the sun was setting more to the south and, by
  this time of day, didn’t shine directly into the back of the house but
  filled it with a warm glow. He walked into the kitchen, loosening his tie, and
  began inspecting the refrigerator for the ingredients they’d need for
  dinner. He grabbed a beer and paused to take a swig as he took a mental
  inventory to make sure nothing was needed from the market.</p>
  <p>Before heading up to change his clothes, he picked up the cordless phone
  that hung next to the security monitor panel. He would try to reach Rachel
  again. They didn’t necessarily talk during the day – once he was in the
  office, he was pretty difficult</p>
  <p>to reach but Rachel would usually leave a voice mail or note if she wasn’t
  going to be home when he arrived. But, again, he received the message that
  &quot;The Nextel customer you are trying to reach is currently unavailable.
  Please try your call again later.&quot;</p>
  <p>As Elliott changed into a pair of khaki shorts and sport shirt, he
  contemplated having another conversation with Andy about coming to work for
  his firm or letting him arrange a couple of interviews with other profitable
  companies. He hated to see his old college roommate struggling for so many
  years for such meager wages. Andy wasn’t making six figures, even with a
  bonus. And to think that he, Elliott, had pulled in over a half million today.
  <i>Andy, what happened to your drive? Where are your priorities, man?</i> But
  Andy was steady and, fortunately, Kim didn’t seem to mind working herself.
  It would just be nice for the four of them to take a <i>real</i> vacation
  together – Europe, Bora Bora, a cruise – and not have to plan around Andy
  and Kim’s budget.</p>
  <p>He was bounding down the stairs, mentally ticking off the names of some
  business associates to call on Monday, when the doorbell rang.</p>
  <p>&quot;Hey! Come on in!&quot; He exchanged a kiss on the cheek with Kim, a
  firm handshake for Andy. They both wore jeans and a t-shirt, as comfortable as
  their friendship.</p>
  <p>&quot;Congratulations!&quot; Kim practically made a song out of this one
  word. &quot;Does this call for another upgrade, another move?&quot;</p>
  <p>Elliott didn’t notice the slight sarcasm in the grin on Kim’s face as
  he led the way into the kitchen. But even these casual celebrations for
  Elliott’s accomplishments, such as this evening’s little get-together,
  made Kim feel anxious about the affect on Andy’s ego.</p>
  <p>&quot;Hell, no. I’m assuming Rachel’s out spending it before I’ve
  collected it, since she’s not home yet.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Have you talked with her?&quot; Andy set the bottle of wine they
  brought on the bar.</p>
  <p>&quot;This need to be refrigerated?&quot; Elliott asked as he peeked under
  the foil covering the Pyrex dish.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes. It’s that Better Than Sex cake you like so much. Want me to
  clear a space?&quot; Kim opened the refrigerator door as she asked this and
  began to make room.</p>
  <p>&quot;So did Rachel know we were coming?&quot; Andy made himself
  comfortable on a barstool.</p>
  <p>&quot;Actually, no. I tried to reach her when I got in. I assume she was
  deep inside the walls of a department store or on her way home and in a dead
  zone because I couldn’t raise her. But I’m sure she’ll be home
  soon.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh, man, why do you do stuff like this to your wife . . . and to
  us?&quot; Kim looked at Andy, shaking her head, as if a mischievous child had
  once again misbehaved. They had witnessed more than one argument caused by
  Elliott making decisions without consulting Rachel. He really wasn’t
  willful, just oblivious, and this was a minor infraction compared to some of
  the others he’d made over the years.</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh, don’t worry about it. She’ll be home soon and, for a change,
  I’ll have dinner ready. She won’t have to do a thing. So, what can I get
  you to drink? Beer? Wine? Something stronger? I can mix up some
  martinis.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh, no. I think I’ll start out slow. Just a beer for me.&quot;</p>
  <p>Elliott pulled out two beers and handed one to Andy. He stood with the
  refrigerator door open, &quot;Okay, Kim, what about you?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I think I’ll start out slower and have some water.&quot; Kim helped
  herself to a glass from the cabinet.</p>
  <p>&quot;Sparkling or still?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Still is fine. No ice. Thanks.&quot; Kim leaned on the counter next
  to Andy while Elliott took up another barstool.</p>
  <p>&quot;So, was this the Citibank or the First United deal you closed
  today?&quot; Andy asked. He didn’t really care but knew Elliott was anxious
  to talk about it. He wasn’t jealous of Elliott – Elliott was a hard
  worker, very driven and deserved to do well.</p>
  <p>He just wished Elliott would occasionally ask about some of the projects he
  was working on. It was as though Elliott didn’t want to know there was even
  a need for building low-income housing, let alone the details involved in
  seeing it all come together.</p>
  <p>&quot;Neither. Provident. I don’t expect Citibank or First United to
  close till the next quarter.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Wow. Pretty soon we’ll have to start dressing to come to dinner
  over here.&quot; Kim wished Rachel could have been in on this joke. Rachel did
  as good a job as possible keeping Elliott grounded, which couldn’t be easy.</p>
  <p>&quot;Kim, you could undress to come to dinner over here and make me a very
  happy guy.&quot; Elliott sprang from his seat, dipped Kim backwards and
  nuzzled into her neck, extracting a surprised squeal. Elliott liked to tease
  but Kim and Andy both knew how devoted he was to Rachel.</p>
  <p>&quot;Actually, Andy, we have a couple of openings at our place. I thought
  I’d talk to you about making a move, stepping up in the financial
  world.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;No, thanks. You can keep your high-paying, stroke-inducing job. I’m
  quite happy where I am.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Hey, I’m the picture of health!&quot; Elliott sat up straight,
  puffed up his chest and sucked in his stomach to prove his point.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yeah but what does a picture tell you?&quot; Andy goaded his friend.
  &quot;I’ll be in my twilight years having spent a small fortune placing
  flowers on your grave.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Well. I’m not done on this subject, but how ‘bout I put you kids
  to work. We’ll have dinner ready to go when Rachel gets in.&quot;</p>
  <p>Kim set down her glass and walked over to wash her hands. &quot;Sure. Tell
  us what you want us to do.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Okay. Kim, you can make the salad. Andy, I’ll get you to slice up
  onions and mushrooms. I’ll take care of the steaks.&quot;</p>
  <p>Elliott began pulling produce from the refrigerator, and bowls, cutting
  boards and knives from cabinets and drawers. All the while he continued his
  sales pitch.</p>
  <p>&quot;Look. I don’t expect you to want a job like mine. But I could put
  you in touch with a couple of guys. You could at least hear what they have to
  say. Who doesn’t want to make more money?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Now why would I trade what I’ve got for more money, longer hours,
  all the politics, and a shorter life expectancy?&quot; Andy paused to take a
  drink from his beer before continuing his defense. &quot;Seriously. I like my
  job and I like the people I work with. You had a good day today but how many
  bad days did you have to suffer through?&quot;</p>
  <p>Elliott paused over the steaks he was seasoning to take in his
  surroundings. &quot;Yeah, I’m suffering. But when I retire at fifty, you and
  Kim can come visit us during your two-week vacation! Now, how you coming with
  those onions and mushrooms?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;All set.&quot; Andy handed the cutting board to Elliott. The butter
  spat out as Elliott slid the onions and mushrooms into the skillet and a
  wonderful aroma began to fill the kitchen.</p>
  <p>&quot;All right, you guys.&quot; Kim’s protective instincts kicked in and
  she decided it was time to change the subject. &quot;Elliott, maybe you should
  try Rachel again.&quot;</p>
  <p>Elliott placed the cutting board in the sink and reached for the phone.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yeah. I can’t imagine where she is. Maybe this was a hair day or a
  nail day and they’re running late. Why she puts up with crap like that . .
  .&quot; He paused as he punched in the numbers and waited. &quot;Nope. Same
  damn message. <i>‘The Nextel subscriber . . .’</i> &quot;, he mimicked,
  shaking his head as he hung up the phone. It was after seven. The sun was just
  about down. It wasn’t like Rachel not to check in.</p>
  <p>&quot;Well, you guys in a hurry? You starved? Want to go ahead and
  eat?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;No, no. Let’s wait.&quot; Andy spoke for both of them. &quot;Rachel
  will be home soon and Kim’s still working on the salad.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Sure?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yeah. Hey, we’re celebrating! Rachel wouldn’t want to be left
  out. But I’m ready for another beer. Kim, you ready for something a little
  stronger?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;No, thanks, I’ll wait.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Okay, well, let’s go ahead and fire up that grill so we’ll be
  ready when Rachel gets in.&quot; Elliott searched through a few drawers until
  he found the lighter wand and, with a fresh beer in the other hand, headed for
  the patio.</p>
  <p>Andy made his way around the kitchen island and, with his free hand, put
  his arm around Kim’s waist as she sliced tomatoes.</p>
  <p>&quot;You okay?&quot; he asked as though she’d been the one having this
  friendly argument.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yeah, I’m fine. Go on out there with him.&quot; Kim turned her head
  to kiss him. &quot;I’ll be out in a minute.&quot;</p>
  <p>While Elliott made the adjustments to the propane tank and the dials on the
  grill, Andy meandered around the decking, admiring his friend’s backyard.
  The accent lights had come on, showcasing the well manicured lawn, the
  full-grown trees and newly planted flowers. The pool glowed a cool, inviting
  blue. He strolled over to the edge of the pool and knelt down to feel the
  temperature of the water. He stopped short and just managed to keep his
  balance as he saw what lay at the bottom of the pool. It took only seconds to
  realize that Rachel wouldn’t be home for dinner, and not because of a late
  shopping spree or hair appointment.</p>
  <p>&quot;Elliott. You better take a look at this.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Let me just get these steaks going.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;No, you better hold off on the steaks and come take a look at
  this.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Ah, shit.&quot;</p>
  <p>Andy heard the lid of the grill drop and the sound of Elliott’s loafers
  on the decking. But he couldn’t look up from what was lying at the bottom of
  the pool and he didn’t want to see the look that he knew would come to his
  best friend’s face.</p>
  <p>&quot;Did those yard guys . . . . &quot;</p>
  <p>Elliott’s voice trailed off as he reached the edge of the pool. He
  teetered for a moment, only slightly aware of Andy’s steadying hand. The
  blood seemed to explode in his head causing dark clouds to form over his eyes.
  Simultaneously, he felt as if someone had punched him in the gut – he had no
  wind to speak with.</p>
  <p>His heart pounding in his ears, he walked the length of the pool - more
  slowly than Andy had, almost like an old man – taking in each item: the
  wedding picture in the gilded frame that she kept on her dressing table; the
  diamond-studded Cartier watch he’d given her so many years ago when he’d
  closed his first big deal; the pearl necklace that was a gift for - was it the
  10<sup>th</sup> or 15<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary?</p>
  <p>Here was the Murano glass bird from the restaurant in Paris where they’d
  spent her 30<sup>th</sup> birthday. One of these glass birds, in different
  colors, decorated each table instead of flowers. What a great trip that had
  been. One of the few times he and Rachel had spent a full two weeks together.</p>
  <p>There was the Waterford crystal box that had held a five-karat emerald cut
  diamond necklace. She thought the box was the gift and had kissed him so
  sweetly. He had to tell her the damn box wasn’t the gift and told her to
  look inside. He’d given it to her at that cheap little restaurant she liked
  so much. It seemed so out of place – giving her a $20,000 necklace over a
  $50 meal.</p>
  <p>Finally, at the deepest end of the pool, he saw what appeared to be a cell
  phone. He fixed on this for the longest time, realizing that this time was
  serious, this time she didn’t want him to get hold of her. And the sound of
  that fucking message played ironically in his head, &quot;The Nextel
  subscriber you are trying to reach is currently unavailable. Please try your
  call again later.&quot;</p>
