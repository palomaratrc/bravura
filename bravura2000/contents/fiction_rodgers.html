  <p><font size="3">I begin Moving.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">Los Angeles bleaknight, I'm moving in it, creating westward
  yellow lines and &quot;takk takk&quot; noises. Emptying myself around the
  corner, my tap shoes clatter against the briny jade pavement. I'm sort of
  shoving my head into my top hat as I complete sublimation into/emerge upon
  Santa Monica Boulevard. That rain has subsided and given a glittery radiance
  to the jade footpath. In my right hand, a fine-toothed saw, a vicious cutting
  object as you'd say. And then, in my left hand, there is a rope and a hook. Oh
  and I'm wearing a bird costume. Progressing towards goal (7-11), the city
  surrounds me in light, fervor, rotund inexplicable chaos. I see the 7-11sign
  in that skyline nether of skyscrapers and constellations that qualify Los
  Angeles as domed enclosure 093AB. Stop.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">I begin listening.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">I hear the sounds of the city, the sounds of car-parked
  transvestites, &quot;Sister, do the right thing&quot; and &quot;Mmmm hmm&quot;
  and Mariachi attaché cases. A rising melodrama of anarchaic occurrence
  (genius?). The 7-11 sign purveys all in red white and green stuporâ€¦â€¦////*.
  Sudden fright (!), efficient chunneling of city sounds through my ears,
  rapidly skiczaws (!) into my tympanic nerve and disrupting my equilibrium it
  is (.) Aarrgghh. Briefly I stagger backwards, disrupting my tap shoe rhythm,
  sliding suddenly into the ether of without-purpose. Car centrifuge,
  &quot;Chorizos de España&quot; signs and metallic foreheads and pink tethered
  ribbons gymnasticizing about the rectangular wind in front of a Korean
  storefront and dogs sleeping and sleepy robots punching in for rudimentary
  servicing all into my auditory ossicles (!!), shuddering throughout my
  startled mind they play tag in my amygdala. So I reach into my pocket, staidly
  ruffling the yellow feathers, and pulloutswitchblade/liftarm/shovel/carve/into/nervepathwaysdisrupt/meatrain.
  Then my ear was on the floor (sidewalk?) and I went on walking.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">Listening aborted.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">Now I couldn't hear. Things were (are?) a lot nicer. Ear
  blood has spattered upon my yellow feathers and tap shoes, but that will work
  itself out I'm sure. Here I am now, two blocks from my goal. Glorious,
  glorious goal! Flapping wings in excitement, the silence of the city cleanses
  me diagonally, I remove my top hat for fear of deity reprisals. Soft rain
  vapor sidewalk aroma. Vacuum outwards foot, step! Step! Glorious rhythm of
  walk and tap! I am walking! Eyes forward, that's right corporal
  (architecture)!</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">I begin looking.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">Eyes lurking in the Los Angeles mist, I find my vision
  colliding with neon commercialism, feudal architecture and crackpipe concrete
  businessman in tweed. These spires of pinksledge shove my skull backwards,
  shove my body backwards. I stand frozen in picturetube viewing, the chaos of
  the city</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">emptying itself exasperatingly into my eyes. Forward motion?
  Halted by numerous horizontal/diagonal/heat-seeking lines of power and
  discourse, my soul is written upon by a neon ad exec. A young girl gallops by,
  clad in Mariachi tradicional, she giggles at my stationary situation. No wait,
  it's</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">a crossdresser, a clever concrete robin with vixen
  dilettante-mask. Well that seals it. She is distraught as I lathe my pupil
  with the back of my knife, I'm tapdancing to reduce the trauma, but my clotted
  feathers</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">annihilate the vector of my compassion. I smile (instead?)
  but the blood waterfalls over the bridge of my lips, cacophonically into the
  pain of the jade sidewalk. S/he stumbles off terrified, screaming
  &quot;-v-v--//-vv-//&quot; But no matter (I decided?)! On to goal.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">Sight aborted.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">I begin feeling.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">Optical sensors sparking against misted Angeles. The wind
  rebounds off the spires of progress (thank God for it), parallaxing upon my
  chest, wrapping itself around the 7-11rotating tower-sign and my bleeding
  corpuscal form, forming a tandem of force, a rubber slice of purpose(!).</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">Vocals! Movement! Crescendo!</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">I progress thoroughly forward, sensing my way through the
  cold, bleak night via vocal echoes. I scream! &quot;-v-//v-v-v-v//-----v&quot;
  (the voice of madness surely), rebounding off of 110 freeway, within metal
  Caltrans pipes, thundering into my chest as I faithfully stop up my wounds
  with gauze (newspaper mud). Screech. Belch. Yell! Directions given, I go this
  (my?) way, feeling the orientation through the silk-threaded dew of the coming
  concrete morning. Step. Step. Outstretch hands, reaching like Midas, stepping.
  Frigid rustmetal greets my handnerve/endings. I've arrived. Setting down my
  top hat, I lean my saw against the metal tree trunk (sign post?). Saw. Saw.
  Saw. Progressâ€¦.?â€¦.///no. The saw issues transient echoes within
  the metropolis of the night-ether. &quot;vvvvvv---///&quot; against my chest.
  Blood just glopped onto my top hat. Jeez. Saw. Muscles are tensing, adrenaline
  is fielding questions by the audience members, I'm cutting down a giant 7-11
  rotating machine-post for use in my bird nest. Metal shards rain down my
  forearm like beach sand, I can feel the tower quaking with the power of my
  wings. Squawk squawk I do! I can feel</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">the screams of passerbys, they seem to object to a human
  (for God's sake, a HUMAN) dislocating their architecture. &quot;v-â€¦v//v!!&quot;,
  yes I'm sure that's what they're saying. Boy, I am thinking, can't get far in
  this city without ears or eyes. Saw. Saw. Saw. I feel a hand upon my shoulder.
  Saw. Turn. Shout vectors and hostility popping around my blanket of space (â€¦.).
  The predictable rhythm of human anger bubbles around my nerve endings.
  &quot;v-v-v-v-v-v&quot; I don't even know how to respond to it anymore (a
  fellow</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">MAN!). &quot;Squawk!&quot; say my vocal chords (so
  indifferently, curse them!) as I continue sawing pissing down my leg staining
  my feathered kneesocks. Oh God, save me from the shame oh no I'm crying. Saw.
  Sawâ€¦â€¦..result (?) (!) (â€¦.?) . I wag my tail in completive
  satisfaction, shuffle awkwardly to the side as</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">I issue a warning to my fellow mans that there is a TIMBER!
  This giant log comes crashing to our ground! Rattle, shake, oh the ecstasy of
  man (shit, I'm a bird) breaking things (!). I'm standing in my triumph, surely
  looking like some sort of hero when one of my eye gauzes falls out. Of course
  I'm totally embarrassed. Then I pick up my top hat as I walk over to the log
  that I felled. I pick it up with one arm (?). Then I drag it back to my nest
  (I'm dragging a 7-11 sign behind me because I'm a bird.) It makes for pretty</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">ideal nesting material is what I am thinking as I'm dragging
  this 7-11 sign away. Draaaag, down icy streets and pendulum motor city
  sidewalks pulling the ether out/in like an elastic bra strap. Ten blocks of
  ether disturbances and sensory blackness, guided by my sonarbelchsquawks.
  Finally home! Bending the pipe into an &quot;O&quot;, stacking the reeds and
  branches, I quickly give birth to a healthy baby bird who immediately finds
  fault with my squalor and flies away all flustered. I mean, that sucks and
  all, but shit, I sawed apart a 7-11 sign and dragged it ten blocks to my
  nesting grounds, I'd say that's pretty important. You don't seem to be doing
  much.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">My forehead is chilled by the night air.</font></p>
