  </b>
  <dt><font size="4">By Ann Smith</font></dt>
  </dl>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;You take hold the bean. Hold it curled side up. Fold
  it toward the middle, and pop! It opens. Then, you take your thumb, that's
  right baby, and push all the little green peas out into the pail. You're doing
  it right now, darlin'.&quot; She musses my hair with a touch as light as a
  butterfly's kiss. Partin' the blond curls and smoothin' them away from my
  face, she then lets her fingers trail down my cheek to catch hold of my chin.
  With my chin captured between her thumb and finger, she wiggles it back and
  forth 'till I smile wide at her, and then she pops a shelled pea through the
  window in my grin where three baby teeth have been missin' for two whole
  years.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">I chew the pea to mush. Opening my mouth and stickin' out my
  tongue impossibly far, I show her the whole gooey mess of green mash stuck on
  it. It is somethin' a young lady of good breedin' would never do. Scandalized,
  Maman slaps her hand to her breast, and declares, &quot;The Devil has done
  possessed you, child!&quot; I hide my whole self from her behind my two hands
  coverin' my eyes. I am invisible. &quot;O, my baby! Where is my girl
  child?&quot; she screams. Then she begins searching high 'n low for me under
  the bucket, around the stoop and even in the basket holdin' the pea pods.
  Grabbin' a single pea pod outta' the basket, she says,&quot;Gotcha!&quot; The
  pod she's holdin' pops open and the peas scatter like marbles. Maman raises
  her hands above her head to get a touch of the Holy Ghost power and in her
  best fire 'n brimstone shout proclaims,&quot;You give up my lamb, Devil!&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;You are over actin' again, Maman.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;Am not,&quot; she sniffs, pokin' her nose high in the
  air.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;Your nose is growin', Maman.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;Is not,&quot; she says, tryin' to look hurt.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">Her eyes crinkle a little at the corners and she blows out
  all her breath into my face just before she stands tall and fills her whole
  self with air 'till her cheeks puff out. Then she lets loose, singing at the
  top of her voice, &quot;Peas, peas, pease. Eatin' Goober Peas. Eatin' Goober,
  Eatin' Goober, Eatin' Goober pease.&quot; Prancin' over close to plant a kiss
  on my brow, she says,&quot;Maman's going to pick some guavas for jam now.
  Nothin' you like better 'n pineapple guava jam on corn fritters, is there
  baby? I'll be right over there, so you can see me. Nothin' to be a' feared of
  . . . 'Peas, peas, pease, eatin' Goober Peas'. . . .&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">She glides. Maman doesn't just walk like other folk. The hem
  of her white organdy dress billows and puffs with the breeze, but the apron
  holds it politely to her thighs. The lady in white approaches a bough, heavy
  laden with fruit. Reaching over to pat the tree's trunk like they were old,
  dear friends, she begs Mrs.Tree a pardon for relievin' her of her little guava
  childrens today.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">Maman adjusts the ladder against the fork of two strong
  branches near the tree's peeling trunk. She tucks the thick, dark brown
  strands of hair that have escaped back neatly into the folds of the kerchief
  tied round her head. She loosens the ribbons cinched under her chin attached
  to the ever present sun bonnet. Touchin' her brow in mock salute to the task
  at hand, adoptin' all the little guava children, she pauses just long enough
  so that I can pray for them. &quot;I solemnly pledge to adore them (spread all
  over my corn fritters) one and all, so help me God!&quot; This said, she
  plucks the bonnet from her head and sails it across the yard at me. I duck,
  but it hits me every time. I giggle, because what she does next always makes
  me laugh out loud. The big<b> </b>giggles are there a waitin' in my tummy.
  &quot;Do it, Maman. Do it!&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">She looks over her shoulder sportin'<i> the look </i>Daddy
  calls &quot;The look of a woman with mischief and mayhem on her mind.&quot;
  She winks, conspiratorially, and then fast as a lightin' bug, bends over,
  grabs fists' full of her skirt, threads it through the needle of splayed legs
  and tucks it ceremoniously into the front bow of her apron. I squeal with
  delight. &quot;Oh maman, you are a caution!&quot; She rewards me with a
  Daddy's smile. The one she saves for him alone, usually. The one that lights
  up a room.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">Kickin' off her shoes, she mounts the ladder. She laces her
  bare toes over the first rung, but skips the second rung because it has been
  missin' since the time of Moses. Foot sure, Maman scrambles up to the top of
  the tree. She's not scared of high up places. Maman plucks the first fruit.
  Mrs. Tree shivers her branches cuz' it hurts just a wee bit to lose her
  childrens.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">The fruit is over ripe 'cuz it's been kissed too many times
  by the sun. Maman fills her apron's pockets, and each time she stretches to
  pluck another, the juice trails down her arm. She licks it off from elbow to
  wrist.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;Careful, Maman, or you'll shame the wood
  sprites.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">Everybody knows shaming the wood sprites is a scary game.
  They take their revenge on litl 'ens, stealin' their breath away while they
  sleep. Their cousins, the swamp angels, carry off the babes 'n hide 'em in the
  swamp forest where they'll sleep forever.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;Don't fret so, baby. The birds know your Maman by
  name.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">The birdies eat wood sprites, and their cousins the swamp
  angels are very much a'feared of them. Maman can talk the birds out of their
  tree, and they give her Mrs. Tree's fruit. They love her. She is beautiful.
  The birdies sing to her and she gives them back a song. &quot;</font><font FACE="French Script MT"><font size="4">Oh,
  where you goin' my good ole' man. Oh, where you goin', and she called him
  alone. Town, Ma. . . . To the Rio Grande, you're the best ole' man, that ever
  was alive.&quot;</font></p>
  </font>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;I'm tired, Maman. Look, I've finished the peas.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;You shor' has, sweetpea.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">She descends the ladder and wraps both her arms around the
  pockets in her apron front, proudly cradling somethin' wonderful, like when
  she carried Julius safe inside the tight skin of her tummy. It makes my mouth
  fair water to watch her walk. She is dripping juicy, pineapple guavas and
  lookin' for all the world like a fairy queen. Maman dances to a stand still
  before me and the peas. Holding out the sides of the apron at each corner, she
  bows in a most stately curtsy, fawning and dipping impossibly low. Then
  gathering her apron in one hand, she picks up her straw bonnet.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;I crown thee Princess Pea,&quot; Maman says, as she
  pushes the bonnet down so that it droops over my forehead.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;I can't see.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;Well, I can. And, I can see you're tired baby.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">She gently pushes, shooing me like the chickens, up the
  steps and through the back door. &quot;It's powerful hot out here,
  anyway.&quot; Pausing at the threshold, holding the screen ajar, she squints
  at the sun, scolding it for its torrid trespasses. I wonder how it has the
  gumption at all to shine in her presence.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;Nap time. Time to hit the hay.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">The screen door slaps against its bug chewed frame, and then
  creeps closed with a squeak and a sigh. The kitchen is cool and dark. I hang
  the bonnet on the peg by the back door.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;Where shall I put the pail for you, Maman?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;Over by the meat grinder, darlin' girl. Jest let me
  get this fruit on to boil, and I'll be in to pet your li'l punkin' head.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">Time to get nakeeee. . . . Running down the hall to my room,
  I snatch the dress over my head so I don't have to bother with the buttons or
  the sash. I hop on one foot, slinging a slipper off, and send the other one to
  join it across the room. I peel away the sweaty cotton, lacy anklets next.
  Arms raised high over my head, I dive onto the baby blue chenille coverlet.
  Wriggling on my tummy like a snake across the bed, I cross to the other side
  against the wall, so Maman has room to lie down with me.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">Turning on my back, quiet as a church mouse, I await my
  audience with the queen. The ceiling fan circles, tipsy like, because the
  plaster has crumbled and a screw is loose. It reminds Maman of Uncle Marvin
  who drinks too much cuz' of the war and I must <i>never</i> sit on his lap. A
  horse fly buzzes around on the updraft of the whirl and I close my eyes to let
  the sweat dry on my lids, and just listen to her sing, serenading the guavas. </font><font FACE="French Script MT"><font size="4">&quot;You
  are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy, when skies are grey.
  You'll never know dear, how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine
  away.&quot;</font></p>
  </font>
  <p><font size="4">I imagine them fairly leaping into the boilin' water just to
  please her highness.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;Hurry, Maman, hurry. My eyes are wanting to close real
  bad. The wood sprites could steal your little girl away and hide her in the
  swamp with Julius. I want to see you . . . one . . . last . . . time.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">Barefooted, she glides down the hallway to my room, almost
  silently, barely slapping the loose floor boards. Her Majesty is summoned
  daily to meet me, Princess Pea, in our secret hideaway. This is where she
  performs all kinds of midday magic. Just for me.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">She stops just short of my room and peeks 'round the door
  jam. It's the game we play. &quot;Shhhhh. My baby is asleep. I'll leave her to
  her dreams.&quot; She pretends to walk away, and then stops halfway down the
  hall like she forgot somethin' specially important. My eyes are squeezed tight
  shut and I'm trying powerful hard not to giggle.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;Time to get naked!&quot;, she screams, spins round and
  runs down the hall back to my room. I hear her snatch the dress over her head,
  so she doesn't have to bother with the buttons or the sash. She peals off her
  slip, and it floats like a prayer to the floor, covering my slippers. She
  dives onto the bed and we bounce up to the ceiling, hugging the hot air high
  up near the blistered plaster. We fall to earth and she flips over on her
  back, too. Just like me.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;Sing Humpty, pleeeease, Maman.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;Don't you want a story first?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;Tell about Julius and the swamp.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;No, that always makes us weepy. And Monday is wash
  day. It always rains buckets on Mondays. Tuesday is pea pickin' day, jolly jam
  day, and singing Humpty to my pumpkin.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">With my head propped on two pillows, I can see the rise and
  fall of her pink tipped breasts with each breath she takes and then each note
  she allows to escape in whispers from her pink tinged lips.<font FACE="French Script MT">
  &quot;Ole' Humpty was dead and buried, buried, buried. Ole' Humpty was dead
  and buried, Um-de-twaddle-dee-day . . . Thay comes an ole' woman to digger him
  up, digger him up, digger him up. Thay comes an ole' woman to digger him up.
  Um-de-twaddle-dee-day.&quot;</font> Before the wood sprites stole our Julius
  from us, he would suckle the afternoon away at those rosy tips. Maman let me
  have a taste once. It was hot and sweet, and I didn't see why Julius liked it
  so much.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">Her tummy is flat like mine now. Our legs are long, and our
  toes are exactly, <i>exactly</i>, the same, though mine are smaller. Our
  shoulders touch and she smells like steamy gardenias, the French in her not
  caring that the hair grows under there. It would fault her femininity to shave
  it off.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;Let's sing Froggy's story, Maman. Pleeeeze.&quot; I
  needn't beg cuz the queen always grants my wishes when the sun is high and we
  are bein' fanciful.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">I begin Froggy's serenade, tryin' to sing low and sultry,
  and failing miserably,&quot; Froggy went a courtin' he did ride, sword and
  pistol by his side,&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">She answers in a bruising contralto that nearly knocks the
  air out of me,</font><font FACE="French Script MT"><font size="4">&quot; When
  upon his high horse set. His boots they shone as black as jet.&quot;</font></p>
  </font>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;He rode right up to mouse's hall. Where he most
  tenderly did call.&quot;</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="French Script MT" size="4">&quot;Oh, Mistress
  Mouse are you within? . . .&quot;</font></p>

  </font>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;Dad, get another morphine tab and tuck it in the side
  of her cheek so we can turn her without hurtin' her too much. There, there, my
  darlin' girl, I'm here.&quot; I pet her head for the few seconds it takes the
  morphine tablet to dull the pain. &quot;I just need to bathe your back so the
  sores don't come, precious one. I'll give you a proper back rub, after we wash
  you.&quot; It's been two weeks since she has talked, but she thanks me with
  her eyes. &quot;Oh, doesn't that feel good. This will cool your fevered skin,
  too, darlin'.&quot; For four months she has been tryin' hard to die. Dying is
  very hard work. &quot;O.K., Dad, I'm finished. Grab the sheet and we can turn
  her back.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="4">Her hands are so cold. Dad warms her left one between his
  calloused hands. Willin' her not to leave him yet, he presses so tight that
  the diamond ring, gone thin after fifty years of constant wear, cuts a brand
  into the skin of his palm. Her skin is still bonnie and beautiful, so white,
  it's almost translucent. Her legs are long, and our feet are the exact same
  size. Her breasts are exactly,<i> exactly,</i> like mine. We ignored the
  changes in ourselves as I grew up and we grew apart. Small, imperceptible
  changes, ignored, grew to devour a life without leaving a trace.</font></p>
