  <p>The piss river stunk up from below the yellow brick road and flowed like a
  river of molten gold out of King Tut’s asshole. An inner tube piled high
  with lost orphans was being tugged around the outskirts of OZ by a greedy
  coyote; soon to disappear through some chain link and lose itself in the
  bowels of our dust</p>
  <p>bowl.</p>
  <p>&quot;Down here the air smells different. Your nostrils have</p>

  <p>Yes, and down there plaster animals are painted like villains and gnawing
  at a roasted puppy impaled on a flaming spit is considered fine dining.</p>
  <p>*</p>
  <p>The sun planet was just descending when Squirts eye was caught by
  something. He wriggled his hand out of Sea Dogs and darted into a little
  tienda where a dozing fat man wearing a straw hat rested.</p>
  <p>&quot;How much for this one?&quot;</p>
  <p>Inquired the excited Squirt.</p>
  <p>&quot;Hey Pop! C’mere, looky here at this!&quot;</p>
  <p>Sea Dog was a tall, thin man. His sunken face suggested that he was not
  well aquainted with the pleasures of our world. He wore a silver handle bar
  mustache and ruby red cowboy boots made from dyed copperhead hide.</p>
  <p>&quot;My God! Now that’s a fine find boy. ...How much amigo?&quot;</p>
  <p>The fat man raised his heavy lids and dug ‘tween his teeth with a long,
  sharp pinky nail. He looked at the two of them standing, holding their
  selection -a portrait of their king with a tear barreling down his chubby
  cheek painted over black velvet- and furrowed his brow. The artist belched out
  a briny bargain, a foul wave of scale and stink.</p>
  <p>&quot;Yellowtail,&quot; he moaned.</p>
  <p>Sea Dog rummaged through his coat pocket for a minute then, like a magician
  with a rabbit, produced a slimy fish; it’s eyeballs staring dead like two
  glazed doughnuts.</p>
  <p>*</p>
  <p>Around the porthole to Candyland lounged winged Oaxacans. There were some
  circling high above dodging around and floating down between the majestic and
  the macabre, two pinnacles which rose high above the sweet escapists mecca,
  puncturing the bloated firmament with their grand stilettos.</p>
  <p>Guardians of the frenzied world of mind, these old creatures, the original
  inhabitants of the land were now rubbish handlers, the untouchable dog-eaters,
  like the Sudras of Varnasrama-Dharma. They hovered high with serpentine
  offspring clutched, dangling from their toothless maws. In front of the
  setting sun planet, they disappeared from sight only to reappear with those
  cherub seedlings bright.</p>
  <p>&quot;Some gums are for chewing or for blowing bubbles best</p>
  <p>but the gums that are for rotting are the gums that I like best.&quot;</p>

  <p>Sea Dog slid a bauble the size of an RNs sheathed fist to the doctor who
  waited across the counter. After studying it for a few seconds the drooling
  Doc lifted his bulging eyes.</p>
  <p>&quot;I know what YOU need.&quot;</p>
  <p>Atop a high shelf behind the counter perched a spotted lemur shamelessly
  copulating with a strange looking cat. The thing was shitting as it dug away
  into that fine feline, Its simian sphincter releasing an ass-load of feces.
  The ape screeched and yowled, wiggling its eyebrows and bearing its
  proto-teeth as it released load after load of putrefied banana like a denizen
  of heaven running low on lightning bolts. He seemed to declare,</p>
  <p>&quot;Hey, I’m no monkey, I just ocelot.&quot;</p>
  <p>The doctor slid a foil slab back over the countertop to Sea Dog.</p>
  <p>&quot;Don’t mind him, he’s Apeshit.&quot;</p>
  <p>*</p>
  <p>At Reginas Squirt and Sea Dog were escorted into a dark corner booth by a
  grinning midget wearing a garland made from painted lotus petals. The two were
  immediately joined by Lolita, a dancing piece of chicken in pasties, who could
  shake her hips with the fury of buckshot; and then Carmen, who greeted Squirt
  by inserting her wasted penis into his ear. Squirt swatted at it like a saint
  protecting a bug lamp.</p>
  <p>The corners of the hall held pedestals where eunuchs in loincloths stood
  guard. One held a strand of ass-brown pearls and pinched the clasp between his
  thumb and forefinger.</p>
  <p>*</p>
  <p>When Sea Dog returned from the banos, his mustache frosted with sky blue
  cat tranquilizer, Squirt got up out of his chair.</p>
  <p>&quot;I’ll see you down stairs.&quot;</p>
  <p>Carmen tried to restrain Squirt with her painted talons. She pulled him
  close to her chest and pleaded.</p>
  <p>&quot;No, no buy me a drink, sweetie please.&quot;</p>
  <p>Sea Dog leapt up onto the table, knocking around its empty bottles, and
  howled. This display seduced the attention of entire hall.</p>
  <p>&quot;Bring me twenty five Cuba Libres!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I’ll see you DOWN STAIRS,&quot; Squirt informed his father
  impatiently.</p>
  <p>-but the old man could only hiss back.</p>
  <p>*</p>
  <p>Outside the streets were frantic and full of strangers from the north and
  native merchants. A man with shaggy hair and spectacles approached Squirt.</p>
  <p>&quot;You wanna ride the fuckin’ swamp rat kid?&quot;</p>
  <p>Squirts eyeballs spun in their sockets.</p>
  <p>&quot;What swamp rat?&quot;</p>
  <p>On the opposite corner of the street there slumped an emaciated capybara.</p>
  <p>-but it was painted white with black stripes.</p>
  <p>&quot;Why does it look like that?&quot;</p>
  <p>The man spun quickly back to his pet and then pulled off his spectacles,
  leaning his shaggy head into Squirts.</p>
  <p>&quot;What do you want from me you fucking pig ...Mickey Mouse?&quot;</p>
  <p>*</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, back inside Reginas, Sea Dog had swallowed all twenty five Cuba
  Libres and replaced them with his own smelly urine, which he offered the clubs
  patrons, pawning the vile drink off as &quot;A Sea Dog Surprise.&quot;</p>
  <p>*</p>
  <p>Outside a soldier held up a lamp post, spinning a pistol around his finger.
  His other hand had been digging around in his pocket when he noticed Squirt.</p>
  <p>The doorway to the right was filled with warmth and light. A pregnant nun
  squatted on the second to last step of the case eating something out of a
  jewelry box.</p>
  <p>&quot;Hey kid.&quot; The soldier stuck his pistol under Squirts jaw and
  whispered into his ear, &quot;You like eet when dey do dis een thah moovies?&quot;</p>
  <p>Just then the nun shrieked and spat up a mouthful of something brown. A
  rumble of bodies tumbled down the stair case and like a specter Sea Dog burst
  out of the light barefoot. A pack of half-naked eunuchs rolled down the
  staircase after, emitting high squeals like a school of dolphins caught in a
  tuna net. They hurled Sea Dogs boots after him, but the man ran like a cheetah
  on crank. Squirt tried to catch up with his old man but saw him fly around the
  corner into a dark labyrinth with a flowing tail of fur as an accomplice. The
  pursuit was futile. The disappointed eunuchs looked to the young Squirt as a
  sacrificial lamb; the gun toting mad man held the means in his right hand; the
  shaggy swamp smuggler will feed his pet anyway that he can; the scented midget
  minus grin had seen all that he could stand. Squirt brushed off Sea Dogs boots
  an slid them on up over his knees. As the crowd envelope him Squirt shut his
  eyes and whispered, &quot;There’s no place. -Like Hell!&quot;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
